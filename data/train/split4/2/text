2092-145706-0000 KLETKE THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A MAN AND WOMAN WHO HAD THREE FINE LOOKING SONS BUT THEY WERE SO POOR THAT THEY HAD HARDLY ENOUGH FOOD FOR THEMSELVES LET ALONE THEIR CHILDREN
2092-145706-0001 OF HER AND THEIR FATHER THE THREE SET FORTH ON THEIR TRAVELS THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE BROTHERS WHOSE NAME WAS FERKO WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WITH A SPLENDID FIGURE BLUE EYES FAIR HAIR
2092-145706-0002 AND A COMPLEXION LIKE MILK AND ROSES HIS TWO BROTHERS WERE AS JEALOUS OF HIM AS THEY COULD BE FOR THEY THOUGHT THAT WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS HE WOULD BE SURE TO BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN THEY WOULD EVER BE
2092-145706-0003 FOR THE SUN WAS HOT AND THEY WERE TIRED OF WALKING FERKO FELL FAST ASLEEP BUT THE OTHER TWO REMAINED AWAKE AND THE ELDEST SAID TO THE SECOND BROTHER WHAT DO YOU SAY TO DOING OUR BROTHER FERKO SOME HARM
2092-145706-0004 HE IS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT EVERYONE TAKES A FANCY TO HIM WHICH IS MORE THAN THEY DO TO US IF WE COULD ONLY GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY WE MIGHT SUCCEED BETTER I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU ANSWERED THE SECOND BROTHER
2092-145706-0005 AND MY ADVICE IS TO EAT UP HIS LOAF OF BREAD AND THEN TO REFUSE TO GIVE HIM A BIT OF OURS UNTIL HE HAS PROMISED TO LET US PUT OUT HIS EYES OR BREAK HIS LEGS HIS ELDEST BROTHER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS PROPOSAL
2092-145706-0006 AND THE TWO WICKED WRETCHES SEIZED FERKO'S LOAF AND ATE IT ALL UP WHILE THE POOR BOY WAS STILL ASLEEP WHEN HE DID AWAKE HE FELT VERY HUNGRY AND TURNED TO EAT HIS BREAD BUT HIS BROTHERS CRIED OUT
2092-145706-0007 YOU ATE YOUR LOAF IN YOUR SLEEP YOU GLUTTON AND YOU MAY STARVE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE BUT YOU WON'T GET A SCRAP OF OURS FERKO WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE EATEN IN HIS SLEEP BUT HE SAID NOTHING
2092-145706-0008 AND FASTED ALL THAT DAY AND THE NEXT NIGHT BUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE BURST INTO TEARS AND IMPLORED HIS BROTHERS TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR BREAD
2092-145706-0009 AND BREAK ONE OF YOUR LEGS THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU A BIT OF OUR BREAD AT THESE WORDS POOR FERKO WEPT MORE BITTERLY THAN BEFORE AND BORE THE TORMENTS OF HUNGER TILL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
2092-145706-0010 THEN HE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER AND HE CONSENTED TO ALLOW HIS LEFT EYE TO BE PUT OUT AND HIS LEFT LEG TO BE BROKEN WHEN THIS WAS DONE HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND EAGERLY FOR THE PIECE OF BREAD
2092-145706-0011 BUT HIS BROTHERS GAVE HIM SUCH A TINY SCRAP THAT THE STARVING YOUTH FINISHED IT IN A MOMENT AND BESOUGHT THEM FOR A SECOND BIT BUT THE MORE FERKO WEPT AND TOLD HIS BROTHERS THAT HE WAS DYING OF HUNGER
2092-145706-0012 THE MORE THEY LAUGHED AND SCOLDED HIM FOR HIS GREED SO HE ENDURED THE PANGS OF STARVATION ALL THAT DAY BUT WHEN NIGHT CAME HIS ENDURANCE GAVE WAY AND HE LET HIS RIGHT EYE BE PUT OUT
2092-145706-0013 AND HIS RIGHT LEG BROKEN FOR A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AFTER HIS BROTHERS HAD THUS SUCCESSFULLY MAIMED AND DISFIGURED HIM FOR LIFE THEY LEFT HIM GROANING ON THE GROUND AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT HIM
2092-145706-0014 POOR FERKO ATE UP THE SCRAP OF BREAD THEY HAD LEFT HIM AND WEPT BITTERLY BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM OR CAME TO HIS HELP NIGHT CAME ON AND THE POOR BLIND YOUTH HAD NO EYES TO CLOSE
2092-145706-0015 AND COULD ONLY CRAWL ALONG THE GROUND NOT KNOWING IN THE LEAST WHERE HE WAS GOING BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS ONCE MORE HIGH IN THE HEAVENS FERKO FELT THE BLAZING HEAT SCORCH HIM
2092-145706-0016 AND SOUGHT FOR SOME COOL SHADY PLACE TO REST HIS ACHING LIMBS HE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A HILL AND LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS AND AS HE THOUGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF A BIG TREE
2092-145706-0017 IS THERE ANYTHING THE LEAST WONDERFUL OR REMARKABLE ABOUT THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I SHOULD JUST THINK THERE WAS REPLIED THE OTHER MANY THINGS THAT DON'T EXIST ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
2092-145706-0018 THERE IS A LAKE DOWN THERE BELOW US AND ANYONE WHO BATHES IN IT THOUGH HE WERE AT DEATH'S DOOR BECOMES SOUND AND WELL ON THE SPOT AND THOSE WHO WASH THEIR EYES WITH THE DEW ON THIS HILL
2092-145706-0019 BECOME AS SHARP SIGHTED AS THE EAGLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN BLIND FROM THEIR YOUTH WELL ANSWERED THE FIRST RAVEN MY EYES ARE IN NO WANT OF THIS HEALING BATH FOR HEAVEN BE PRAISED
2092-145706-0020 THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THEY WERE BUT MY WING HAS BEEN VERY FEEBLE AND WEAK EVER SINCE IT WAS SHOT BY AN ARROW MANY YEARS AGO SO LET US FLY AT ONCE TO THE LAKE THAT I MAY BE RESTORED TO HEALTH AND STRENGTH AGAIN
2092-145706-0021 AND SO THEY FLEW AWAY THEIR WORDS REJOICED FERKO'S HEART AND HE WAITED IMPATIENTLY TILL EVENING SHOULD COME AND HE COULD RUB THE PRECIOUS DEW ON HIS SIGHTLESS EYES
2092-145706-0022 AT LAST IT BEGAN TO GROW DUSK AND THE SUN SANK BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS GRADUALLY IT BECAME COOLER ON THE HILL AND THE GRASS GREW WET WITH DEW THEN FERKO BURIED HIS FACE IN THE GROUND
2092-145706-0023 TILL HIS EYES WERE DAMP WITH DEWDROPS AND IN A MOMENT HE SAW CLEARER THAN HE HAD EVER DONE IN HIS LIFE BEFORE THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND LIGHTED HIM TO THE LAKE WHERE HE COULD BATHE HIS POOR BROKEN LEGS
2092-145706-0024 THEN FERKO CRAWLED TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE AND DIPPED HIS LIMBS IN THE WATER NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO
2092-145706-0025 HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE MET A WOLF WHO WAS LIMPING DISCONSOLATELY ALONG ON THREE LEGS AND WHO ON PERCEIVING FERKO BEGAN TO HOWL DISMALLY MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE YOUTH
2092-145706-0026 BE OF GOOD CHEER FOR I CAN SOON HEAL YOUR LEG AND WITH THESE WORDS HE POURED SOME OF THE PRECIOUS WATER OVER THE WOLF'S PAW AND IN A MINUTE THE ANIMAL WAS SPRINGING ABOUT SOUND AND WELL ON ALL FOURS
2092-145706-0027 THE GRATEFUL CREATURE THANKED HIS BENEFACTOR WARMLY AND PROMISED FERKO TO DO HIM A GOOD TURN IF HE SHOULD EVER NEED IT FERKO CONTINUED HIS WAY TILL HE CAME TO A PLOUGHED FIELD
2092-145706-0028 HERE HE NOTICED A LITTLE MOUSE CREEPING WEARILY ALONG ON ITS HIND PAWS FOR ITS FRONT PAWS HAD BOTH BEEN BROKEN IN A TRAP FERKO FELT SO SORRY FOR THE LITTLE BEAST
2092-145706-0029 THAT HE SPOKE TO IT IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER AND WASHED ITS SMALL PAWS WITH THE HEALING WATER IN A MOMENT THE MOUSE WAS SOUND AND WHOLE AND AFTER THANKING THE KIND PHYSICIAN IT SCAMPERED AWAY OVER THE PLOUGHED FURROWS
2092-145706-0030 FERKO AGAIN PROCEEDED ON HIS JOURNEY BUT HE HADN'T GONE FAR BEFORE A QUEEN BEE FLEW AGAINST HIM TRAILING ONE WING BEHIND HER WHICH HAD BEEN CRUELLY TORN IN TWO BY A BIG BIRD
2092-145706-0031 FERKO WAS NO LESS WILLING TO HELP HER THAN HE HAD BEEN TO HELP THE WOLF AND THE MOUSE SO HE POURED SOME HEALING DROPS OVER THE WOUNDED WING ON THE SPOT THE QUEEN BEE WAS CURED AND TURNING TO FERKO SHE SAID
2092-145706-0032 I AM MOST GRATEFUL FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND SHALL REWARD YOU SOME DAY AND WITH THESE WORDS SHE FLEW AWAY HUMMING GAILY THEN FERKO WANDERED ON FOR MANY A LONG DAY
2092-145706-0033 AND AT LENGTH REACHED A STRANGE KINGDOM HERE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF HE MIGHT AS WELL GO STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND OFFER HIS SERVICES TO THE KING OF THE COUNTRY FOR HE HAD HEARD THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER
2092-145706-0034 THEY HAD MANAGED TO OBTAIN PLACES IN THE KING'S SERVICE AND WHEN THEY RECOGNISED FERKO WITH HIS EYES AND LEGS SOUND AND WELL THEY WERE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH FOR THEY FEARED HE WOULD TELL THE KING OF THEIR CONDUCT
2092-145706-0035 FOR SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE SO HANDSOME IN HER LIFE BEFORE HIS BROTHERS NOTICED THIS AND ENVY AND JEALOUSY WERE ADDED TO THEIR FEAR SO MUCH SO THAT THEY DETERMINED ONCE MORE TO DESTROY HIM
2092-145706-0036 THEY WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THAT FERKO WAS A WICKED MAGICIAN WHO HAD COME TO THE PALACE WITH THE INTENTION OF CARRYING OFF THE PRINCESS THEN THE KING HAD FERKO BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND SAID
2092-145706-0037 YOU ARE ACCUSED OF BEING A MAGICIAN WHO WISHES TO ROB ME OF MY DAUGHTER AND I CONDEMN YOU TO DEATH BUT IF YOU CAN FULFIL THREE TASKS WHICH I SHALL SET YOU TO DO YOUR LIFE SHALL BE SPARED
2092-145706-0038 ON CONDITION YOU LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT IF YOU CANNOT PERFORM WHAT I DEMAND YOU SHALL BE HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE AND TURNING TO THE TWO WICKED BROTHERS HE SAID SUGGEST SOMETHING FOR HIM TO DO
2092-145706-0039 NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT HE MUST SUCCEED IN IT OR DIE THEY DID NOT THINK LONG BUT REPLIED LET HIM BUILD YOUR MAJESTY IN ONE DAY A MORE BEAUTIFUL PALACE THAN THIS AND IF HE FAILS IN THE ATTEMPT
2092-145706-0040 LET HIM BE HUNG THE KING WAS PLEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND COMMANDED FERKO TO SET TO WORK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE TWO BROTHERS WERE DELIGHTED FOR THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD NOW GOT RID OF FERKO FOR EVER
2092-145706-0041 AS HE WAS WANDERING DISCONSOLATELY ABOUT THE MEADOWS ROUND THE PALACE WONDERING HOW HE COULD ESCAPE BEING PUT TO DEATH A LITTLE BEE FLEW PAST AND SETTLING ON HIS SHOULDER WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
2092-145706-0042 WHAT IS TROUBLING YOU MY KIND BENEFACTOR CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU I AM THE BEE WHOSE WING YOU HEALED
2092-145706-0043 A PALACE SHALL BE BUILT UNLIKE ANY THAT KING HAS DWELT IN BEFORE JUST STAY HERE TILL I COME AGAIN AND TELL YOU THAT IT IS FINISHED HAVING SAID THIS SHE FLEW MERRILY AWAY AND FERKO
2092-145706-0044 BE OF GOOD CHEER AND LEAD THE KING TO THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS AND HUMMING GAILY SHE FLEW AWAY AGAIN FERKO WENT AT ONCE TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THE PALACE WAS FINISHED
2092-145706-0045 THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER AND THEIR ASTONISHMENT WAS GREAT AT THE SIGHT WHICH MET THEIR EYES A SPLENDID PALACE REARED ITSELF ON THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY MADE OF THE MOST EXQUISITE FLOWERS
2092-145706-0046 WITH SUNFLOWERS FOR KNOCKERS AND ALL ROUND HYACINTHS AND OTHER SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS BLOOMED IN MASSES SO THAT THE AIR WAS PERFUMED FAR AND NEAR AND ENCHANTED ALL WHO WERE PRESENT
2092-145706-0047 THIS SPLENDID PALACE HAD BEEN BUILT BY THE GRATEFUL QUEEN BEE WHO HAD SUMMONED ALL THE OTHER BEES IN THE KINGDOM TO HELP HER THE KING'S AMAZEMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND THE PRINCESS'S EYES BEAMED WITH DELIGHT
2092-145706-0048 ON THE DELIGHTED FERKO BUT THE TWO BROTHERS HAD GROWN QUITE GREEN WITH ENVY AND ONLY DECLARED THE MORE THAT FERKO WAS NOTHING BUT A WICKED MAGICIAN
2092-145706-0049 THE KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED AT THE WAY HIS COMMANDS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT WAS VERY VEXED
2092-145706-0050 AND TURNING TO THE TWO BROTHERS HE SAID HE HAS CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED THE FIRST TASK WITH THE AID NO DOUBT OF HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC BUT WHAT SHALL WE GIVE HIM TO DO NOW
2092-145706-0051 LET US MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE AND IF HE FAILS HE SHALL DIE THEN THE ELDEST BROTHER REPLIED THE CORN HAS ALL BEEN CUT BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO BARNS
2092-145706-0052 LET THE KNAVE COLLECT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM INTO ONE BIG HEAP BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS LEFT LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH
2092-145706-0053 THE PRINCESS GREW WHITE WITH TERROR WHEN SHE HEARD THESE WORDS BUT FERKO FELT MUCH MORE CHEERFUL THAN HE HAD DONE THE FIRST TIME AND WANDERED OUT INTO THE MEADOWS AGAIN
2092-145706-0054 BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY OF ESCAPE THE SUN SANK TO REST AND NIGHT CAME ON WHEN A LITTLE MOUSE STARTED OUT OF THE GRASS AT FERKO'S FEET AND SAID TO HIM I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
2092-145706-0055 MY KIND BENEFACTOR BUT WHY ARE YOU LOOKING SO SAD CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU AND THUS REPAY YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO ME THEN FERKO RECOGNISED THE MOUSE WHOSE FRONT PAWS HE HAD HEALED AND REPLIED
2092-145706-0056 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM HAS TO BE GATHERED INTO ONE BIG HEAP AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS WANTING I MUST PAY FOR IT WITH MY LIFE IS THAT ALL ANSWERED THE MOUSE
2092-145706-0057 THAT NEEDN'T DISTRESS YOU MUCH JUST TRUST IN ME AND BEFORE THE SUN SETS AGAIN YOU SHALL HEAR THAT YOUR TASK IS DONE AND WITH THESE WORDS THE LITTLE CREATURE SCAMPERED AWAY INTO THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0058 FERKO WHO NEVER DOUBTED THAT THE MOUSE WOULD BE AS GOOD AS ITS WORD LAY DOWN COMFORTED ON THE SOFT GRASS AND SLEPT SOUNDLY TILL NEXT MORNING THE DAY PASSED SLOWLY
2092-145706-0059 AND THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER
2092-145706-0060 FOR IN A HEAP HIGHER THAN THE KING'S PALACE LAY ALL THE GRAIN OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT A SINGLE STALK OF CORN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN ANY OF THE FIELDS AND HOW HAD ALL THIS BEEN DONE
2092-145706-0061 THE LITTLE MOUSE HAD SUMMONED EVERY OTHER MOUSE IN THE LAND TO ITS HELP AND TOGETHER THEY HAD COLLECTED ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM THE KING COULD NOT HIDE HIS AMAZEMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME HIS WRATH INCREASED
2092-145706-0062 AND HE WAS MORE READY THAN EVER TO BELIEVE THE TWO BROTHERS WHO KEPT ON REPEATING
2092-145706-0063 THAN A WICKED MAGICIAN ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS REJOICED OVER FERKO'S SUCCESS AND LOOKED ON HIM WITH FRIENDLY GLANCES WHICH THE YOUTH RETURNED THE MORE THE CRUEL KING GAZED ON THE WONDER BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0064 THE MORE ANGRY HE BECAME FOR HE COULD NOT IN THE FACE OF HIS PROMISE PUT THE STRANGER TO DEATH HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE TWO BROTHERS AND SAID HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC HAS HELPED HIM AGAIN
2092-145706-0065 BUT NOW WHAT THIRD TASK SHALL WE SET HIM TO DO NO MATTER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS HE MUST DO IT OR DIE THE ELDEST ANSWERED QUICKLY LET HIM DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THIS HILL
2092-145706-0066 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT IF HE DOES THIS HE MAY GO FREE IF NOT HE SHALL BE HUNG AS YOU HAVE SAID AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCESS BURST INTO TEARS
2092-145706-0067 AND WHEN THE KING SAW THIS HE ORDERED HER TO BE SHUT UP IN A HIGH TOWER AND CAREFULLY GUARDED TILL THE DANGEROUS MAGICIAN SHOULD EITHER HAVE LEFT THE KINGDOM OR BEEN HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE FERKO WANDERED OUT INTO THE FIELDS AGAIN
2092-145706-0068 AND SAT DOWN ON THE STUMP OF A TREE WONDERING WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT SUDDENLY A BIG WOLF RAN UP TO HIM AND STANDING STILL SAID I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MY KIND BENEFACTOR
2092-145706-0069 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT ALL ALONE BY YOURSELF IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANY WAY ONLY SAY THE WORD FOR I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PROOF OF MY GRATITUDE FERKO AT ONCE RECOGNISED THE WOLF
2092-145706-0070 WHOSE BROKEN LEG HE HAD HEALED AND TOLD HIM WHAT HE HAD TO DO THE FOLLOWING DAY IF HE WISHED TO ESCAPE WITH HIS LIFE BUT HOW IN THE WORLD HE ADDED AM I TO COLLECT ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THAT HILL OVER THERE
2092-145706-0071 IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT DONE ANSWERED THE WOLF YOU NEEDN'T WORRY YOURSELF I'LL UNDERTAKE THE TASK AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN BEFORE SUNSET TO MORROW
2092-145706-0072 AND WITH THESE WORDS HE TROTTED QUICKLY AWAY THEN THE YOUTH REJOICED GREATLY FOR NOW HE FELT THAT HIS LIFE WAS SAFE BUT HE GREW VERY SAD WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS
2092-145706-0073 AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN IF HE LEFT THE COUNTRY HE LAY DOWN ONCE MORE ON THE GRASS AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP ALL THE NEXT DAY HE SPENT WANDERING ABOUT THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0074 THEN RETURN AT ONCE TO ME AND GET ON MY BACK AND I WILL HELP YOU TO DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES TOGETHER THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND TOLD THE KING THAT HE WAS READY TO PERFORM THE THIRD TASK IF HE WOULD COME TO THE HILL AND SEE IT DONE
2092-145706-0075 FERKO HIMSELF RETURNED TO THE FIELDS AND MOUNTING ON THE WOLF'S BACK HE RODE TO THE WOOD CLOSE BY QUICK AS LIGHTNING THE WOLF FLEW ROUND THE WOOD AND IN A MINUTE MANY HUNDRED WOLVES ROSE UP BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0076 INCREASING IN NUMBER EVERY MOMENT TILL THEY COULD BE COUNTED BY THOUSANDS HE DROVE THEM ALL BEFORE HIM ON TO THE HILL WHERE THE KING AND HIS WHOLE COURT AND FERKO'S TWO BROTHERS WERE STANDING ONLY THE LOVELY PRINCESS WAS NOT PRESENT
2092-145706-0077 FOR SHE WAS SHUT UP IN HER TOWER WEEPING BITTERLY THE WICKED BROTHERS STAMPED AND FOAMED WITH RAGE WHEN THEY SAW THE FAILURE OF THEIR WICKED DESIGNS BUT THE KING WAS OVERCOME BY A SUDDEN TERROR
2092-145706-0078 WHEN HE SAW THE ENORMOUS PACK OF WOLVES APPROACHING NEARER AND NEARER AND CALLING OUT TO FERKO HE SAID ENOUGH ENOUGH WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BUT THE WOLF ON WHOSE BACK FERKO SAT SAID TO ITS RIDER
2092-145706-0079 GO ON GO ON AND AT THE SAME MOMENT MANY MORE WOLVES RAN UP THE HILL HOWLING HORRIBLY AND SHOWING THEIR WHITE TEETH THE KING IN HIS TERROR CALLED OUT STOP A MOMENT I WILL GIVE YOU HALF MY KINGDOM
2092-145706-0080 IF YOU WILL DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES AWAY BUT FERKO PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR AND DROVE SOME MORE THOUSANDS BEFORE HIM SO THAT EVERYONE QUAKED WITH HORROR AND FEAR THEN THE KING RAISED HIS VOICE AGAIN AND CALLED OUT
2092-145706-0081 STOP YOU SHALL HAVE MY WHOLE KINGDOM IF YOU WILL ONLY DRIVE THESE WOLVES BACK TO THE PLACES THEY CAME FROM BUT THE WOLF KEPT ON ENCOURAGING FERKO AND SAID GO ON GO ON SO HE LED THE WOLVES ON
2092-145706-0082 TILL AT LAST THEY FELL ON THE KING AND ON THE WICKED BROTHERS AND ATE THEM AND THE WHOLE COURT UP IN A MOMENT THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND SET THE PRINCESS FREE AND ON THE SAME DAY
2092-145706-0083 HE MARRIED HER AND WAS CROWNED KING OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WOLVES ALL WENT PEACEFULLY BACK TO THEIR OWN HOMES AND FERKO AND HIS BRIDE LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN PEACE AND HAPPINESS TOGETHER
2092-145709-0000 KLETKE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE PRINCESSES WHO WERE ALL THREE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL BUT THE YOUNGEST ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT FAIRER THAN THE OTHER TWO WAS THE MOST LOVEABLE OF THEM ALL
2092-145709-0001 ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE PALACE IN WHICH THEY LIVED THERE STOOD A CASTLE WHICH WAS UNINHABITED AND ALMOST A RUIN BUT THE GARDEN WHICH SURROUNDED IT WAS A MASS OF BLOOMING FLOWERS
2092-145709-0002 AND IN THIS GARDEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS USED OFTEN TO WALK ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS PACING TO AND FRO UNDER THE LIME TREES A BLACK CROW HOPPED OUT OF A ROSE BUSH IN FRONT OF HER
2092-145709-0003 THE POOR BEAST WAS ALL TORN AND BLEEDING AND THE KIND LITTLE PRINCESS WAS QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT WHEN THE CROW SAW THIS IT TURNED TO HER AND SAID I AM NOT REALLY A BLACK CROW
2092-145709-0004 BUT AN ENCHANTED PRINCE WHO HAS BEEN DOOMED TO SPEND HIS YOUTH IN MISERY IF YOU ONLY LIKED PRINCESS YOU COULD SAVE ME BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY GOOD BYE TO ALL YOUR OWN PEOPLE
2092-145709-0005 AND COME AND BE MY CONSTANT COMPANION IN THIS RUINED CASTLE THERE IS ONE HABITABLE ROOM IN IT IN WHICH THERE IS A GOLDEN BED THERE YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE ALL BY YOURSELF
2092-145709-0006 AND DON'T FORGET THAT WHATEVER YOU MAY SEE OR HEAR IN THE NIGHT YOU MUST NOT SCREAM OUT FOR IF YOU GIVE AS MUCH AS A SINGLE CRY MY SUFFERINGS WILL BE DOUBLED
2092-145709-0007 THE GOOD NATURED PRINCESS AT ONCE LEFT HER HOME AND HER FAMILY AND HURRIED TO THE RUINED CASTLE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ROOM WITH THE GOLDEN BED
2092-145709-0008 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED SHE LAY DOWN BUT THOUGH SHE SHUT HER EYES TIGHT SLEEP WOULD NOT COME AT MIDNIGHT SHE HEARD TO HER GREAT HORROR SOME ONE COMING ALONG THE PASSAGE AND IN A MINUTE
2092-145709-0009 HER DOOR WAS FLUNG WIDE OPEN AND A TROOP OF STRANGE BEINGS ENTERED THE ROOM THEY AT ONCE PROCEEDED TO LIGHT A FIRE IN THE HUGE FIREPLACE THEN THEY PLACED A GREAT CAULDRON OF BOILING WATER ON IT
2092-145709-0010 WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY APPROACHED THE BED ON WHICH THE TREMBLING GIRL LAY AND SCREAMING AND YELLING ALL THE TIME THEY DRAGGED HER TOWARDS THE CAULDRON SHE NEARLY DIED WITH FRIGHT
2092-145709-0011 BUT SHE NEVER UTTERED A SOUND THEN OF A SUDDEN THE COCK CREW AND ALL THE EVIL SPIRITS VANISHED AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CROW APPEARED AND HOPPED ALL ROUND THE ROOM WITH JOY
2092-145709-0012 IT THANKED THE PRINCESS MOST HEARTILY FOR HER GOODNESS AND SAID THAT ITS SUFFERINGS HAD ALREADY BEEN GREATLY LESSENED NOW ONE OF THE PRINCESS'S ELDER SISTERS WHO WAS VERY INQUISITIVE
2092-145709-0013 THAT AT LAST THE GOOD NATURED LITTLE PRINCESS CONSENTED BUT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN THE ODD FOLK APPEARED THE ELDER SISTER SCREAMED WITH TERROR AND FROM THIS TIME ON THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
2092-145709-0014 INSISTED ALWAYS ON KEEPING WATCH ALONE SO SHE LIVED IN SOLITUDE ALL THE DAYTIME AND AT NIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED HAD SHE NOT BEEN SO BRAVE BUT EVERY DAY
2092-145709-0015 THE CROW CAME AND THANKED HER FOR HER ENDURANCE AND ASSURED HER THAT HIS SUFFERINGS WERE FAR LESS THAN THEY HAD BEEN AND SO TWO YEARS PASSED AWAY WHEN ONE DAY THE CROW CAME TO THE PRINCESS AND SAID
2092-145709-0016 IN ANOTHER YEAR I SHALL BE FREED FROM THE SPELL I AM UNDER AT PRESENT BECAUSE THEN THE SEVEN YEARS WILL BE OVER BUT BEFORE I CAN RESUME MY NATURAL FORM
2092-145709-0017 AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE BELONGINGS OF MY FOREFATHERS YOU MUST GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TAKE SERVICE AS A MAIDSERVANT THE YOUNG PRINCESS CONSENTED AT ONCE AND FOR A WHOLE YEAR
2092-145709-0018 AND HAD WORKED HER LITTLE WHITE HANDS WEARY SHE HEARD A RUSTLING BESIDE HER AND A CRY OF JOY THEN SHE SAW A HANDSOME YOUTH STANDING BESIDE HER WHO KNELT DOWN AT HER FEET
2092-145709-0019 AND KISSED THE LITTLE WEARY WHITE HANDS I AM THE PRINCE HE SAID WHO YOU IN YOUR GOODNESS WHEN I WAS WANDERING ABOUT IN THE SHAPE OF A BLACK CROW FREED FROM THE MOST AWFUL TORMENTS
2092-145709-0020 COME NOW TO MY CASTLE WITH ME AND LET US LIVE THERE HAPPILY TOGETHER SO THEY WENT TO THE CASTLE WHERE THEY HAD BOTH ENDURED SO MUCH
2092-145709-0021 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE SAME FOR IT HAD ALL BEEN REBUILT AND DONE UP AGAIN
248-130644-0000 IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO BLAME THE RECTOR OF PENNICOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE LOOKED AT GWENDOLEN AS A GIRL LIKELY TO MAKE A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE
248-130644-0001 WHY SHOULD HE BE EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS MATTER AND WISH HIS NIECE A WORSE END OF HER CHARMING MAIDENHOOD THAN THEY WOULD APPROVE AS THE BEST POSSIBLE
248-130644-0002 IT IS RATHER TO BE SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT THAT HIS FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED AND IN CONSIDERING THE RELATION OF MEANS TO ENDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERE FOLLY TO HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE EXCEPTIONAL AND IDYLLIC
248-130644-0003 IN ORDER THAT A MARQUIS MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER OR TO HAVE INSISTED THAT SINCE A FAIR MAIDEN WAS TO BE SOUGHT SHE SHOULD KEEP HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY MISTER GASCOIGNE'S CALCULATIONS WERE OF THE KIND CALLED RATIONAL
248-130644-0004 AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
248-130644-0005 HER UNCLE'S INTENTION FELL IN PERFECTLY WITH GWENDOLEN'S OWN WISHES BUT LET NO ONE SUPPOSE THAT SHE ALSO CONTEMPLATED A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE AS THE DIRECT END OF HER WITCHING THE WORLD WITH HER GRACE ON HORSEBACK OR WITH ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT
248-130644-0006 THAT SHE WAS TO BE MARRIED SOME TIME OR OTHER SHE WOULD HAVE FELT OBLIGED TO ADMIT AND THAT HER MARRIAGE WOULD NOT BE OF A MIDDLING KIND SUCH AS MOST GIRLS WERE CONTENTED WITH SHE FELT QUIETLY UNARGUMENTATIVELY SURE
248-130644-0007 BUT HER THOUGHTS NEVER DWELT ON MARRIAGE AS THE FULFILLMENT OF HER AMBITION THE DRAMAS IN WHICH SHE IMAGINED HERSELF A HEROINE WERE NOT WROUGHT UP TO THAT CLOSE TO BE VERY MUCH SUED OR HOPELESSLY SIGHED FOR AS A BRIDE WAS INDEED
248-130644-0008 AN INDISPENSABLE AND AGREEABLE GUARANTEE OF WOMANLY POWER BUT TO BECOME A WIFE AND WEAR ALL THE DOMESTIC FETTERS OF THAT CONDITION WAS ON THE WHOLE A VEXATIOUS NECESSITY HER OBSERVATION OF MATRIMONY HAD INCLINED HER TO THINK IT RATHER A DREARY STATE
248-130644-0009 IN WHICH A WOMAN COULD NOT DO WHAT SHE LIKED HAD MORE CHILDREN THAN WERE DESIRABLE WAS CONSEQUENTLY DULL AND BECAME IRREVOCABLY IMMERSED IN HUMDRUM OF COURSE MARRIAGE WAS SOCIAL PROMOTION
248-130644-0010 SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD TO A SINGLE LIFE BUT PROMOTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES TO BE TAKEN WITH BITTER HERBS A PEERAGE WILL NOT QUITE DO INSTEAD OF LEADERSHIP TO THE MAN WHO MEANT TO LEAD AND THIS DELICATE LIMBED SYLPH OF TWENTY MEANT TO LEAD
248-130644-0011 FOR SUCH PASSIONS DWELL IN FEMININE BREASTS ALSO IN GWENDOLEN'S HOWEVER THEY DWELT AMONG STRICTLY FEMININE FURNITURE AND HAD NO DISTURBING REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING OR THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
248-130644-0012 HER KNOWLEDGE BEING SUCH AS WITH NO SORT OF STANDING ROOM OR LENGTH OF LEVER COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MOVE THE WORLD SHE MEANT TO DO WHAT WAS PLEASANT TO HERSELF IN A STRIKING MANNER
248-130644-0013 AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
248-130644-0014 BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
248-130644-0015 THE ARCHERY CLUB AND INVITATIONS TO DINE WITH THE ARROWPOINTS AS THE HIGHEST LIGHTS IN HER SCENERY WAS NOT A POSITION THAT SEEMED TO OFFER REMARKABLE CHANCES BUT GWENDOLEN'S CONFIDENCE LAY CHIEFLY IN HERSELF
248-130644-0016 SHE FELT WELL EQUIPPED FOR THE MASTERY OF LIFE WITH REGARD TO MUCH IN HER LOT HITHERTO SHE HELD HERSELF RATHER HARDLY DEALT WITH BUT AS TO HER EDUCATION SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD LEFT HER UNDER NO DISADVANTAGES
248-130644-0017 IN THE SCHOOL ROOM HER QUICK MIND HAD TAKEN READILY THAT STRONG STARCH OF UNEXPLAINED RULES AND DISCONNECTED FACTS WHICH SAVES IGNORANCE FROM ANY PAINFUL SENSE OF LIMPNESS
248-130644-0018 AND WHAT REMAINED OF ALL THINGS KNOWABLE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THROUGH NOVELS PLAYS AND POEMS ABOUT HER FRENCH AND MUSIC THE TWO JUSTIFYING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A YOUNG LADY SHE FELT NO GROUND FOR UNEASINESS
248-130644-0019 AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
248-130644-0020 WHO CAN WONDER IF GWENDOLEN FELT READY TO MANAGE HER OWN DESTINY THERE WERE MANY SUBJECTS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS THE MAJORITY IN WHICH SHE FELT NO INTEREST BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID
248-130644-0021 FOR SUBJECTS ARE APT TO APPEAR STUPID TO THE YOUNG AS LIGHT SEEMS DULL TO THE OLD BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AT ALL HELPLESS IN RELATION TO THEM IF THEY HAD TURNED UP IN CONVERSATION IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD DISPUTED HER POWER OR HER GENERAL SUPERIORITY
248-130644-0022 WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
248-130644-0023 IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
248-130644-0024 IF WHEN THEY WERE UNDER THE STRESS OF TRAVELING SHE DID NOT APPEAR AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE TILL EVERY ONE ELSE HAD FINISHED THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HOW GWENDOLEN'S COFFEE AND TOAST SHOULD STILL BE OF THE HOTTEST AND CRISPEST
248-130644-0025 IT WAS ALWAYS SHE HERSELF WHO HAD TO BE TOLERANT TO BEG THAT ALICE WHO SAT WAITING ON HER WOULD NOT STICK UP HER SHOULDERS IN THAT FRIGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT ISABEL INSTEAD OF PUSHING UP TO HER AND ASKING QUESTIONS WOULD GO AWAY TO MISS MERRY
248-130644-0026 ALWAYS SHE WAS THE PRINCESS IN EXILE WHO IN TIME OF FAMINE WAS TO HAVE HER BREAKFAST ROLL MADE OF THE FINEST BOLTED FLOUR FROM THE SEVEN THIN EARS OF WHEAT AND IN A GENERAL DECAMPMENT WAS TO HAVE HER SILVER FORK KEPT OUT OF THE BAGGAGE
248-130644-0027 HOW WAS THIS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE ANSWER MAY SEEM TO LIE QUITE ON THE SURFACE IN HER BEAUTY A CERTAIN UNUSUALNESS ABOUT HER
248-130644-0028 A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
248-130644-0029 THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUDDEN SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KEEPING UP THE FORMS OF LIFE AND EVEN THE WAITERS AT HOTELS SHOWED THE MORE ALACRITY IN DOING AWAY WITH CRUMBS AND CREASES AND DREGS WITH STRUGGLING FLIES IN THEM
248-130644-0030 THIS POTENT CHARM ADDED TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS THE ELDEST DAUGHTER TOWARD WHOM HER MAMMA HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN AN APOLOGETIC STATE OF MIND FOR THE EVILS BROUGHT ON HER BY A STEP FATHER MAY SEEM SO FULL A REASON FOR GWENDOLEN'S DOMESTIC EMPIRE
248-130644-0031 THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
248-130644-0032 WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
248-130644-0033 SOME OF THEM WERE A VERY COMMON SORT OF MEN AND THE ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE AMONG THEM ALL WAS A STRONG DETERMINATION TO HAVE WHAT WAS PLEASANT WITH A TOTAL FEARLESSNESS IN MAKING THEMSELVES DISAGREEABLE OR DANGEROUS WHEN THEY DID NOT GET IT
248-130644-0034 THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
248-130644-0035 FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
248-130644-0036 WE CANNOT KILL AND NOT KILL IN THE SAME MOMENT
248-130652-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
248-130652-0001 ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
248-130652-0002 THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
248-130652-0003 MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
248-130652-0004 GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
248-130652-0005 THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
248-130652-0006 HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
248-130652-0007 GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
248-130652-0008 WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
248-130652-0009 AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
248-130652-0010 THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
248-130652-0011 TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
248-130652-0012 SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
248-130652-0013 I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
248-130652-0014 SILENCE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GRANDCOURT SAID WHAT MEN ARE INVITED HERE WITH THEIR WIVES
248-130652-0015 THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
248-130652-0016 GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
248-130652-0017 AND ONE OF YOUR DAMNED MUSICIANS BUT NOT A COMIC FELLOW I WONDER IF KLESMER WOULD CONSENT TO COME TO US WHEN HE LEAVES QUETCHAM NOTHING BUT FIRST CLASS MUSIC WILL GO DOWN WITH MISS ARROWPOINT
248-130652-0018 LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS
248-130652-0019 WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
248-130652-0020 YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION
248-130652-0021 THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
248-130652-0022 AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
248-130652-0023 PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
248-130652-0024 AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
248-130652-0025 WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
248-130652-0026 HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
248-130652-0027 EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
248-130652-0028 HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
248-130652-0029 LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
248-130652-0030 CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
248-130652-0031 IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
248-130652-0032 WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
248-130652-0033 AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
248-130652-0034 SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
248-130652-0035 AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
248-130652-0036 BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
248-130652-0037 LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
248-130652-0038 SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
248-130652-0039 AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
248-130697-0000 ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
248-130697-0001 DEEDS ARE THE PULSE OF TIME HIS BEATING LIFE AND RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS BEING DONE MUST THROB IN AFTER THROBS TILL TIME ITSELF BE LAID IN DARKNESS
248-130697-0002 AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
248-130697-0003 AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
248-130697-0004 WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
248-130697-0005 AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
248-130697-0006 PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
248-130697-0007 BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
248-130697-0008 IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
248-130697-0009 THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
248-130697-0010 AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
248-130697-0011 SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE
248-130697-0012 THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
248-130697-0013 BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
248-130697-0014 THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF
248-130697-0015 IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
248-130697-0016 WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID
248-130697-0017 I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
248-130697-0018 AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
248-130697-0019 WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
248-130697-0020 I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
248-130697-0021 IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
248-130697-0022 AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
248-130697-0023 TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
248-130697-0024 AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
248-130697-0025 NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
248-130697-0026 GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
248-130697-0027 OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
248-130697-0028 WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
248-130697-0029 BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
248-130697-0030 SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
248-130697-0031 DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
248-130697-0032 WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
248-130697-0033 YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
248-130697-0034 IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME
248-130697-0035 HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
248-130697-0036 BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
2514-149482-0000 HE RECEIVED FROM MISSUS LOWDER ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS VISIT TO KATE THE TELEGRAPHIC EXPRESSION OF A HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE FREE TO DINE WITH THEM THAT EVENING AND HIS FREEDOM AFFECTED HIM AS FORTUNATE EVEN THOUGH IN SOME DEGREE QUALIFIED BY HER MISSIVE
2514-149482-0001 EXPECTING AMERICAN FRIENDS WHOM I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU KNOW HIS KNOWLEDGE OF AMERICAN FRIENDS WAS CLEARLY AN ACCIDENT OF WHICH HE WAS TO TASTE THE FRUIT TO THE LAST BITTERNESS THIS APPREHENSION HOWEVER WE HASTEN TO ADD
2514-149482-0002 ENJOYED FOR HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE EVENT A CERTAIN MERCIFUL SHRINKAGE THE IMMEDIATE EVENT BEING THAT AT LANCASTER GATE FIVE MINUTES AFTER HIS DUE ARRIVAL PRESCRIBED HIM FOR EIGHT THIRTY MISSUS STRINGHAM CAME IN ALONE
2514-149482-0003 THE LONG DAYLIGHT THE POSTPONED LAMPS THE HABIT OF THE HOUR MADE DINNERS LATE AND GUESTS STILL LATER SO THAT PUNCTUAL AS HE WAS HE HAD FOUND MISSUS LOWDER ALONE WITH KATE HERSELF NOT YET IN THE FIELD
2514-149482-0004 HE HAD THUS HAD WITH HER SEVERAL BEWILDERING MOMENTS BEWILDERING BY REASON FAIRLY OF THEIR TACIT INVITATION TO HIM TO BE SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLE THIS WAS EXACTLY GOODNESS KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO BE
2514-149482-0005 BUT HE HAD NEVER HAD IT SO LARGELY AND FREELY SO SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLY FOR THAT MATTER IMPUTED TO HIM AS OF EASY ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS A PARTICULAR IN WHICH AUNT MAUD APPEARED TO OFFER HERSELF AS AN EXAMPLE APPEARED TO SAY QUITE AGREEABLY
2514-149482-0006 WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
2514-149482-0007 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS WELL TO ASK HER HOW FEASIBLE SHE SUPPOSED IT FOR A POOR YOUNG MAN TO RESEMBLE HER AT ANY POINT BUT HE HAD AFTER ALL SOON ENOUGH PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AS SHE WISHED BY LETTING HIS WONDER SHOW
2514-149482-0008 JUST A LITTLE AS SILLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS MOREOVER OF A SMALL STRANGE DREAD OF THE RESULTS OF DISCUSSION WITH HER STRANGE TRULY BECAUSE IT WAS HER GOOD NATURE NOT HER ASPERITY THAT HE FEARED ASPERITY MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM ANGRY
2514-149482-0009 IN WHICH THERE WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT GOOD NATURE IN HIS CONDITIONS HAD A TENDENCY TO MAKE HIM ASHAMED WHICH AUNT MAUD INDEED WONDERFULLY LIKING HIM FOR HIMSELF QUITE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING GUESSED TO SPARE HIM THEREFORE SHE ALSO AVOIDED DISCUSSION
2514-149482-0010 SHE KEPT HIM DOWN BY REFUSING TO QUARREL WITH HIM THIS WAS WHAT SHE NOW PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENJOY AND HIS SECRET DISCOMFORT WAS HIS SENSE THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT HIM BEING KEPT DOWN WAS A BORE BUT
2514-149482-0011 HIS GREAT DREAD VERILY WAS OF BEING ASHAMED WHICH WAS A THING DISTINCT AND IT MATTERED BUT LITTLE THAT HE WAS ASHAMED OF THAT TOO IT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF HIS POSITION THAT IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS THE TABLES COULD ALWAYS BE TURNED ON HIM
2514-149482-0012 THE PLACE HOWEVER MUFFLED IN CONVENIENCE AND DECORUM CONSTANTLY HUMMED FOR HIM WITH THAT THICK IRONY
2514-149482-0013 AND HE HAD ALREADY SEEN HOW LITTLE AID CAME TO HIM FROM DENOUNCING THE BRIBES AS UGLY IN FORM THAT WAS WHAT THE PRECIOUS METALS THEY ALONE COULD AFFORD TO BE IT WAS VAIN ENOUGH FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY TO TRY TO IMPART A GLOSS TO HIS OWN COMPARATIVE BRUMMAGEM
2514-149482-0014 THE HUMILIATION OF THIS IMPOTENCE WAS PRECISELY WHAT AUNT MAUD SOUGHT TO MITIGATE FOR HIM BY KEEPING HIM DOWN AND AS HER EFFORT TO THAT END HAD DOUBTLESS NEVER YET BEEN SO VISIBLE HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER FELT SO DEFINITELY PLACED IN THE WORLD
2514-149482-0015 AS WHILE HE WAITED WITH HER FOR HER HALF DOZEN OTHER GUESTS SHE WELCOMED HIM GENIALLY BACK FROM THE STATES AS TO HIS VIEW OF WHICH HER FEW QUESTIONS THOUGH NOT COHERENT WERE COMPREHENSIVE
2514-149482-0016 AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
2514-149482-0017 THE IDEA OF A VISIT TO THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY HAD CLEARLY BUT JUST OCCURRED TO HER YET SHE WAS TALKING OF IT AT THE END OF A MINUTE AS HER FAVOURITE DREAM HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN IT BUT HE PRETENDED TO THIS HELPED HER AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE
2514-149482-0018 TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND
2514-149482-0019 FOR NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THE PERSON TO THE RELIEF OF WHOSE SHYNESS HER NIECE OSTENSIBLY CAME THE OSTENSIBLE IN KATE STRUCK HIM ALTOGETHER ON THIS OCCASION AS PRODIGIOUS
2514-149482-0020 WHILE SCARCELY LESS PRODIGIOUS FOR THAT MATTER WAS HIS OWN READING ON THE SPOT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN HIS COMPANIONS A RELATION LIGHTED FOR HIM BY THE STRAIGHT LOOK NOT EXACTLY LOVING NOR LINGERING YET SEARCHING AND SOFT
2514-149482-0021 THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY
2514-149482-0022 AND CONSUMMATELY RECKONED THAT WAS THE STORY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR HER BENEFICENT DRAGON UNDER ARMS LIVING UP EVERY HOUR BUT ESPECIALLY AT FESTAL HOURS TO THE VALUE MISSUS LOWDER HAD ATTACHED TO HER
2514-149482-0023 HIGH AND FIXED THIS ESTIMATE RULED ON EACH OCCASION AT LANCASTER GATE THE SOCIAL SCENE SO THAT HE NOW RECOGNISED IN IT SOMETHING LIKE THE ARTISTIC IDEA THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE IMPOSED BY TRADITION BY GENIUS BY CRITICISM
2514-149482-0024 IN RESPECT TO A GIVEN CHARACTER ON A DISTINGUISHED ACTRESS AS SUCH A PERSON WAS TO DRESS THE PART TO WALK TO LOOK TO SPEAK IN EVERY WAY TO EXPRESS THE PART SO ALL THIS WAS WHAT KATE WAS TO DO FOR THE CHARACTER SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN
2514-149482-0025 THINGS ALL PERFECTLY PONDERABLE TO CRITICISM AND THE WAY FOR HER TO MEET CRITICISM WAS EVIDENTLY AT THE START TO BE SURE HER MAKE UP HAD HAD THE LAST TOUCH AND THAT SHE LOOKED AT LEAST NO WORSE THAN USUAL
2514-149482-0026 AUNT MAUD'S APPRECIATION OF THAT TO NIGHT WAS INDEED MANAGERIAL AND THE PERFORMER'S OWN CONTRIBUTION FAIRLY THAT OF THE FAULTLESS SOLDIER ON PARADE DENSHER SAW HIMSELF FOR THE MOMENT AS IN HIS PURCHASED STALL AT THE PLAY
2514-149482-0027 THE WATCHFUL MANAGER WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF A BOX AND THE POOR ACTRESS IN THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT SHE PASSED THE POOR PERFORMER HE COULD SEE HOW SHE ALWAYS PASSED HER WIG HER PAINT HER JEWELS EVERY MARK OF HER EXPRESSION IMPECCABLE
2514-149482-0028 AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER
2514-149482-0029 TIME AMONG THEM FOR HIM TO FEEL ALMOST TOO SCARED TO TAKE PART IN THE OVATION HE STRUCK HIMSELF AS HAVING LOST FOR THE MINUTE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SO THAT IN ANY CASE HE ONLY STARED IN SILENCE AT THE OLDER WOMAN'S TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
2514-149482-0030 IT WAS AS IF THE DRAMA IT THUS CAME TO HIM FOR THE FACT OF A DRAMA THERE WAS NO BLINKING WAS BETWEEN THEM THEM QUITE PREPONDERANTLY WITH MERTON DENSHER RELEGATED TO MERE SPECTATORSHIP A PAYING PLACE IN FRONT AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE
2514-149482-0031 THIS WAS WHY HIS APPRECIATION HAD TURNED FOR THE INSTANT TO FEAR HAD JUST TURNED AS WE HAVE SAID TO SICKNESS
2514-149482-0032 THAT THE DISCIPLINED FACE DID OFFER HIM OVER THE FOOTLIGHTS AS HE BELIEVED THE SMALL GLEAM FINE FAINT BUT EXQUISITE OF A SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE SO MIGHT A PRACTISED PERFORMER EVEN WHEN RAKED BY DOUBLE BARRELLED GLASSES SEEM TO BE ALL IN HER PART
2514-149482-0033 AND YET CONVEY A SIGN TO THE PERSON IN THE HOUSE SHE LOVED BEST THE DRAMA AT ALL EVENTS AS DENSHER SAW IT MEANWHILE WENT ON AMPLIFIED SOON ENOUGH BY THE ADVENT OF TWO OTHER GUESTS STRAY GENTLEMEN BOTH STRAGGLERS IN THE ROUT OF THE SEASON
2514-149482-0034 WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE
2514-149482-0035 THAT EACH IN HIS WAY MADE ONE THE EXPANSIVE THE OTHER THE CONTRACTILE EFFECT OF THE PERFECT WHITE WAISTCOAT A SCRATCH COMPANY OF TWO INNOCUOUS YOUTHS AND A PACIFIED VETERAN WAS THEREFORE WHAT NOW OFFERED ITSELF TO MISSUS STRINGHAM
2514-149482-0036 HER COMPANION AT THE LAST MOMENT HAD BEEN INDISPOSED POSITIVELY NOT WELL ENOUGH AND SO HAD PACKED HER OFF INSISTENTLY WITH EXCUSES WITH WILD REGRETS
2514-149482-0037 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR CHARMING FRIEND'S ILLNESS WAS THE FIRST THING KATE TOOK UP WITH DENSHER ON THEIR BEING ABLE AFTER DINNER
2514-149482-0038 NATURALLY AS SHE CALLED IT WHICH WASN'T WHAT HE DID TOGETHER BUT IT WAS ALREADY AS IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD BY AN ODD IMPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
2514-149482-0039 MISSUS LOWDER HAD MADE DEAR MILLY THE TOPIC AND IT PROVED ON THE SPOT A TOPIC AS FAMILIAR TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNGER AS TO THE SAGACIOUS OLDER MAN ANY KNOWLEDGE THEY MIGHT LACK MISSUS LOWDER'S NIECE WAS MOREOVER ALERT TO SUPPLY
2514-149482-0040 WHILE DENSHER HIMSELF WAS FREELY APPEALED TO AS THE MOST PRIVILEGED AFTER ALL OF THE GROUP WASN'T IT HE WHO HAD IN A MANNER INVENTED THE WONDERFUL CREATURE THROUGH HAVING SEEN HER FIRST CAUGHT HER IN HER NATIVE JUNGLE HADN'T HE MORE OR LESS PAVED THE WAY
2514-149482-0041 FOR HER BY HIS PROMPT RECOGNITION OF HER RARITY BY PRECEDING HER IN A FRIENDLY SPIRIT AS HE HAD THE EAR OF SOCIETY WITH A SHARP FLASHLIGHT OR TWO HE MET POOR DENSHER THESE ENQUIRIES AS HE COULD
2514-149482-0042 LISTENING WITH INTEREST YET WITH DISCOMFORT WINCING IN PARTICULAR DRY JOURNALIST AS HE WAS TO FIND IT SEEMINGLY SUPPOSED OF HIM THAT HE HAD PUT HIS PEN OH HIS PEN AT THE SERVICE OF PRIVATE DISTINCTION THE EAR OF SOCIETY
2514-149482-0043 THEY WERE TALKING OR ALMOST AS IF HE HAD PUBLICLY PARAGRAPHED A MODEST YOUNG LADY THEY DREAMT DREAMS IN TRUTH HE APPEARED TO PERCEIVE THAT FAIRLY WAKED HIM UP AND HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS PLACE
2514-149482-0044 BOTH TO RESIST HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND TO CATCH THE FULL REVELATION HIS EMBARRASSMENT CAME NATURALLY FROM THE FACT THAT IF HE COULD CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR MISS THEALE'S SUCCESS SO NEITHER COULD HE GRACEFULLY INSIST ON HIS NOT HAVING BEEN CONCERNED WITH HER
2514-149482-0045 MISSUS LOWDER HAD WONDERS TO TELL OF IT THE TWO WEARERS OF THE WAISTCOAT EITHER WITH SINCERITY OR WITH HYPOCRISY PROFESSED IN THE MATTER AN EQUAL EXPERTNESS AND DENSHER AT LAST SEEMED TO KNOW HIMSELF IN PRESENCE OF A SOCIAL CASE
2514-149482-0046 IT WAS MISSUS STRINGHAM OBVIOUSLY WHOSE TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST INVOKED HADN'T SHE BEEN AS HER FRIEND'S REPRESENTATIVE RATHER CONFINED TO THE FUNCTION OF INHALING THE INCENSE SO THAT KATE
2514-149482-0047 WHO TREATED HER BEAUTIFULLY SMILING AT HER CHEERING AND CONSOLING HER ACROSS THE TABLE APPEARED BENEVOLENTLY BOTH TO SPEAK AND TO INTERPRET FOR HER KATE SPOKE AS IF SHE WOULDN'T PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THEIR WAY OF APPRECIATING MILLY
2514-149482-0048 BUT WOULD LET THEM NONE THE LESS IN JUSTICE TO THEIR GOOD WILL EXPRESS IT IN THEIR COARSER FASHION DENSHER HIMSELF WASN'T UNCONSCIOUS IN RESPECT TO THIS OF A CERTAIN BROAD BROTHERHOOD WITH MISSUS STRINGHAM WONDERING INDEED WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE TALK HOW
2514-149482-0049 IT MIGHT MOVE AMERICAN NERVES HE HAD ONLY HEARD OF THEM BEFORE BUT IN HIS RECENT TOUR HE HAD CAUGHT THEM IN THE REMARKABLE FACT AND THERE WAS NOW A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN IT CAME TO HIM THAT HE HAD PERHAPS AND NOT IN THE WAY OF AN ESCAPE
2514-149482-0050 TAKEN A LESSON FROM THEM THEY QUIVERED CLEARLY THEY HUMMED AND DRUMMED THEY LEAPED AND BOUNDED IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S TYPICAL ORGANISM THIS LADY STRIKING HIM AS BEFORE ALL THINGS EXCITED AS IN THE NATIVE PHRASE KEYED UP
2514-149482-0051 TO A PERCEPTION OF MORE ELEMENTS IN THE OCCASION THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ABLE TO COUNT SHE WAS ACCESSIBLE TO SIDES OF IT HE IMAGINED THAT WERE AS YET OBSCURE TO HIM FOR THOUGH SHE UNMISTAKEABLY REJOICED AND SOARED
2514-149482-0052 HER LITTLE DRY NEW ENGLAND BRIGHTNESS HE HAD SAMPLED ALL THE SHADES OF THE AMERICAN COMPLEXITY IF COMPLEXITY IT WERE HAD ITS ACTUAL REASONS FOR FINDING RELIEF MOST IN SILENCE
2514-149482-0053 SO THAT BEFORE THE SUBJECT WAS CHANGED HE PERCEIVED WITH SURPRISE AT THE OTHERS THAT THEY HAD GIVEN HER ENOUGH OF IT
2514-149482-0054 HAD REALLY NOT MADE IN HER OWN COUNTRY THE MARK SHE HAD CHALKED SO LARGE IN LONDON
2514-149482-0055 WHILE HE SCARCE KNEW IF HE WERE THE MORE IMPRESSED WITH HER LAUNCHING IT UNDER MISSUS STRINGHAM'S NOSE OR WITH HER HOPE THAT HE WOULD ALLOW TO LONDON THE HONOUR OF DISCOVERY THE LESS EXPANSIVE OF THE WHITE WAISTCOATS PROPOUNDED THE THEORY THAT THEY SAW IN LONDON
2514-149482-0056 FOR ALL THAT WAS SAID MUCH FURTHER THAN IN THE STATES IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HE URGED THAT THEY HAD TAUGHT THE AMERICANS TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FUNNY SOME NATIVE PRODUCT
2514-149482-0057 BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS
2514-149482-0058 THEY SOMETIMES SENT OUT BEAUTIES AND CELEBRITIES WHO LEFT THE BRITON COLD THE BRITON'S TEMPERATURE IN TRUTH WASN'T TO BE CALCULATED A FORMULATION OF THE MATTER THAT WAS NOT REACHED
2514-149482-0059 SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE POINT OF VIEW FOR A PROPER ADMIRATION OF HER YOUNG FRIEND HAD SEEMED TO FAIL A LITTLE IN NEW YORK THERE WAS NO MANNER OF DOUBT OF HER HAVING CARRIED BOSTON BY STORM
2514-149482-0060 IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING
2514-149482-0061 THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND
2514-149482-0062 HE HADN'T PRETENDED HE DID BUT THERE WAS A PURITY OF REPROACH IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S FACE AND TONE A PURITY CHARGED APPARENTLY WITH SOLEMN MEANINGS SO THAT FOR A LITTLE SMALL AS HAD BEEN HIS CLAIM HE COULDN'T BUT FEEL THAT SHE EXAGGERATED
2514-149482-0063 BUT WHILE DOING SO HE DEFENDED HIMSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ENORMOUSLY MUCH BEYOND HER HAVING BEEN MOST KIND TO ME IN NEW YORK AS A POOR BEWILDERED AND NEWLY LANDED ALIEN
2514-149482-0064 AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION
2514-149482-0065 THOUGH WHAT IT EXPRESSED HE FAILED AT THE TIME TO MAKE OUT YOU WEREN'T PRESENT THEN DEAREST MISSUS LOWDER RICHLY CONCURRED YOU DON'T KNOW SHE CONTINUED WITH MELLOW GAIETY HOW FAR THINGS MAY HAVE GONE
2514-149482-0066 IT MADE THE LITTLE WOMAN HE COULD SEE REALLY LOSE HER HEAD SHE HAD MORE THINGS IN THAT HEAD THAN ANY OF THEM IN ANY OTHER UNLESS PERHAPS IT WERE KATE WHOM HE FELT AS INDIRECTLY WATCHING HIM DURING THIS FOOLISH PASSAGE
2514-149482-0067 AND BECAUSE OF THE FOOLISHNESS NOT TO MEET HER EYES HE MET MISSUS STRINGHAM'S WHICH AFFECTED HIM WITH HER HE COULD ON OCCASION CLEAR IT UP A SENSE PRODUCED BY THE MUTE COMMUNION BETWEEN THEM AND
2514-149482-0068 REALLY THE BEGINNING AS THE EVENT WAS TO SHOW OF SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS EVEN ALREADY A LITTLE THE EFFECT OF THIS COMMUNION THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM PERCEPTIBLY FALTERED IN HER RETORT TO MISSUS LOWDER'S JOKE
2514-149482-0069 OH IT'S PRECISELY MY POINT THAT MISTER DENSHER CAN'T HAVE HAD VAST OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SHE SMILED AT HIM I WASN'T AWAY YOU KNOW LONG IT MADE EVERYTHING IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY RIGHT FOR HIM
2514-149482-0070 AND I WASN'T THERE LONG EITHER HE POSITIVELY SAW WITH IT THAT NOTHING FOR HIM SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED WOULD AGAIN BE WRONG SHE'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T SAY SHE'S EASY TO KNOW
2514-149482-0071 AS IF NOW TO KEEP WELL WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING BETTER SHE WAS OFF WITH YOU TO THESE PARTS BEFORE I KNEW IT I MYSELF WAS OFF TOO AWAY OFF TO WONDERFUL PARTS WHERE I HAD ENDLESSLY MORE TO SEE
2514-149482-0072 BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS
2514-149482-0073 SHE'LL THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR SAID MISSUS STRINGHAM WITH A FLUSHED FIRMNESS YET DOESN'T SILENCE IN SUCH A CASE AUNT MAUD BLANDLY ENQUIRED VERY OFTEN QUITE PROVE THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION
2514-149482-0074 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSED HADN'T HE BEEN SLIGHTLY DISPLEASED AT ALL THEY SEEMED DESIROUS TO FASTEN ON HIM WELL THE IMPRESSION WAS AS DEEP AS YOU LIKE BUT I REALLY WANT MISS THEALE TO KNOW HE PURSUED FOR MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT I DON'T FIGURE BY ANY CONSENT OF MY OWN
2514-149482-0075 KATE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE IF ASSISTANCE IT WAS BEFORE THEIR FRIEND HAD HAD TIME TO MEET THIS CHARGE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER NOT BEING EASY TO KNOW ONE SEES HER WITH INTENSITY SEES HER MORE THAN ONE SEES ALMOST ANY ONE BUT THEN ONE DISCOVERS
2514-149482-0076 THAT THAT ISN'T KNOWING HER AND THAT ONE MAY KNOW BETTER A PERSON WHOM ONE DOESN'T SEE AS I SAY HALF SO MUCH THE DISCRIMINATION WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE FACT OF HER SUCCESS AND IT WAS AT THAT COMPARATIVELY GROSS CIRCUMSTANCE
2514-149482-0077 NOW SO FULLY PLACED BEFORE THEM THAT MILLY'S ANXIOUS COMPANION SAT AND LOOKED LOOKED VERY MUCH AS SOME SPECTATOR IN AN OLD TIME CIRCUS MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ODDITY OF A CHRISTIAN MAIDEN IN THE ARENA MILDLY CARESSINGLY MARTYRED
2514-149482-0078 IT WAS THE NOSING AND FUMBLING NOT OF LIONS AND TIGERS BUT OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS LET LOOSE AS FOR THE JOKE EVEN THE JOKE MADE MISSUS STRINGHAM UNEASY AND HER MUTE COMMUNION WITH DENSHER TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED
2514-149482-0079 HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
2514-149482-0080 IF SHE ACTUALLY MISSED AT ANY RATE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S DISCOMFORT THAT BUT SHOWED HOW HER OWN IDEA HELD HER HER OWN IDEA WAS BY INSISTING ON THE FACT OF THE GIRL'S PROMINENCE AS A FEATURE OF THE SEASON'S END
2514-149482-0081 TO KEEP DENSHER IN RELATION FOR THE REST OF THEM BOTH TO PRESENT AND TO PAST IT'S EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT MAKES YOU NATURALLY A LITTLE SHY ABOUT HER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BUT WE DO WE'VE SEEN IT AND FOLLOWED IT
2514-149482-0082 WE'VE A LITTLE BEEN OF IT THE GREAT THING FOR HIM AT THIS AS KATE GAVE IT WAS IN FACT QUITE IRRESISTIBLY THAT THE CASE WAS A REAL ONE THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN ONE'S PATIENCE WAS SHORTER THAN ONE'S CURIOSITY
2514-149482-0083 ONE HAD VAGUELY TAKEN FOR POSSIBLE IN LONDON BUT IN WHICH ONE HAD NEVER BEEN EVEN TO THIS SMALL EXTENT CONCERNED THE LITTLE AMERICAN'S SUDDEN SOCIAL ADVENTURE HER HAPPY AND NO DOUBT HARMLESS FLOURISH
2514-149482-0084 HAD PROBABLY BEEN FAVOURED BY SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BUT IT HAD BEEN FAVOURED ABOVE ALL BY THE SIMPLE SPRING BOARD OF THE SCENE BY ONE OF THOSE COMMON CAPRICES OF THE NUMBERLESS FOOLISH FLOCK GREGARIOUS MOVEMENTS AS INSCRUTABLE
2514-149482-0085 AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY
2514-149482-0086 BUT THE GREAT REASON WAS PROBABLY THE ABSENCE AT THE MOMENT OF A LARGER LION THE BIGGER BEAST WOULD COME AND THE SMALLER WOULD THEN INCONTINENTLY VANISH IT WAS AT ALL EVENTS CHARACTERISTIC
2514-149482-0087 AND WHAT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF IT WAS GRIST TO HIS SCRIBBLING MILL MATTER FOR HIS JOURNALISING HAND THAT HAND ALREADY IN INTENTION PLAYED OVER IT THE MOTIVE AS A SIGN OF THE SEASON A FEATURE OF THE TIME OF THE PURELY EXPEDITIOUS
2514-149482-0088 AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
2514-149482-0089 THE AUTHOR OF THE ROTTEN BOOK THE BEAUTY WHO WAS NO BEAUTY THE HEIRESS WHO WAS ONLY THAT THE STRANGER WHO WAS FOR THE MOST PART SAVED FROM BEING INCONVENIENTLY STRANGE BUT BY BEING INCONVENIENTLY FAMILIAR
2514-149482-0090 THE CREATURE IN FINE AS TO WHOM SPANGLES OR SPOTS OF ANY SUFFICIENTLY MARKED AND EXHIBITED SORT COULD BE LOUDLY ENOUGH PREDICATED
2514-149482-0091 AND THE TONE OF SOCIETY WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE HIM TAKE UP AGAIN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF CIVILISED BUT IF THIS WAS CIVILISATION ONE COULD SMOKE ONE'S PIPE OUTSIDE WHEN TWADDLE WAS WITHIN
2514-149482-0092 HE HAD RATHER AVOIDED AS WE HAVE REMARKED KATE'S EYES BUT THERE CAME A MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD FAIRLY HAVE LIKED TO PUT IT ACROSS THE TABLE TO HER I SAY LIGHT OF MY LIFE IS THIS THE GREAT WORLD
2514-149482-0093 THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
2514-149482-0094 NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS
2514-149482-0095 SHE ENUNCIATED TO RELIEVE HIS BEWILDERMENT THE OBVIOUS TRUTH THAT YOU COULDN'T LEAVE LONDON FOR THREE MONTHS AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AND COME BACK TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS JUST WHERE THEY WERE AS THEY HAD OF COURSE BEEN JIGGING AWAY
2514-149482-0096 THEY MIGHT WELL BE SO RED IN THE FACE THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEM SHE RECONCILED IN FINE HIS DISCLAIMER ABOUT MILLY WITH THAT HONOUR OF HAVING DISCOVERED HER WHICH IT WAS VAIN FOR HIM MODESTLY TO SHIRK HE HAD UNEARTHED HER
2514-149482-0097 BUT IT WAS THEY ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WHO HAD DEVELOPED HER SHE WAS ALWAYS A CHARMER ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SEEN BUT SHE WASN'T THE PERSON HE HAD BACKED
2514-149482-0098 DENSHER WAS TO FEEL SURE AFTERWARDS THAT KATE HAD HAD IN THESE PLEASANTRIES NO CONSCIOUS ABOVE ALL NO INSOLENT PURPOSE OF MAKING LIGHT OF POOR SUSAN SHEPHERD'S PROPERTY IN THEIR YOUNG FRIEND WHICH PROPERTY BY SUCH REMARKS
2514-149482-0099 WAS VERY MUCH PUSHED TO THE WALL BUT HE WAS ALSO TO KNOW THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM HAD SECRETLY RESENTED THEM MISSUS STRINGHAM HOLDING THE OPINION OF WHICH HE WAS ULTIMATELY TO HAVE A GLIMPSE THAT ALL THE KATE CROYS IN CHRISTENDOM WERE BUT DUST FOR THE FEET OF HER MILLY
2514-149482-0100 THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL
2514-149482-0101 SHE SLIPPED IN THE OBSERVATION THAT HER MILLY WAS INCAPABLE OF CHANGE WAS JUST EXACTLY ON THE CONTRARY
2514-149482-0102 SHE WAS PERFECTLY KIND TO SUSIE IT WAS AS IF SHE POSITIVELY KNEW HER AS HANDICAPPED FOR ANY DISAGREEMENT BY FEELING THAT SHE KATE HAD TYPE AND BY BEING COMMITTED TO ADMIRATION OF TYPE
2514-149482-0103 KATE HAD OCCASION SUBSEQUENTLY SHE FOUND IT SOMEHOW TO MENTION TO OUR YOUNG MAN MILLY'S HAVING SPOKEN TO HER OF THIS VIEW ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART SHE WOULD LIKE MILLY HAD HAD IT FROM HER TO PUT KATE CROY IN A BOOK AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SO DO WITH HER
2514-149482-0104 CHOP ME UP FINE OR SERVE ME WHOLE IT WAS A WAY OF BEING GOT AT THAT KATE PROFESSED SHE DREADED IT WOULD BE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S HOWEVER SHE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE MISSUS STRINGHAM ODDLY FELT
2514-149482-0105 THAT WITH SUCH STUFF AS THE STRANGE ENGLISH GIRL WAS MADE OF STUFF THAT IN SPITE OF MAUD MANNINGHAM WHO WAS FULL OF SENTIMENT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN THERE WAS NONE OTHER TO BE EMPLOYED THESE THINGS WERE OF LATER EVIDENCE
2514-149482-0106 YET DENSHER MIGHT EVEN THEN HAVE FELT THEM IN THE AIR THEY WERE PRACTICALLY IN IT ALREADY WHEN KATE WAIVING THE QUESTION OF HER FRIEND'S CHEMICAL CHANGE WOUND UP WITH THE COMPARATIVELY UNOBJECTIONABLE PROPOSITION THAT HE MUST NOW HAVING MISSED SO MUCH
2514-149482-0107 TAKE THEM ALL UP ON TRUST FURTHER ON HE MET IT PEACEFULLY A LITTLE PERHAPS AS AN EXAMPLE TO MISSUS STRINGHAM OH AS FAR ON AS YOU LIKE THIS EVEN HAD ITS EFFECT MISSUS STRINGHAM APPROPRIATED AS MUCH OF IT AS MIGHT BE MEANT FOR HERSELF
302-123504-0000 A FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDS THE THING WHICH MORE NEARLY RESEMBLED OUR EARTHLY MEN THAN IT DID THE MARTIANS I HAD SEEN HELD ME PINIONED TO THE GROUND WITH ONE HUGE FOOT
302-123504-0001 WHILE IT JABBERED AND GESTICULATED AT SOME ANSWERING CREATURE BEHIND ME THIS OTHER WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY ITS MATE SOON CAME TOWARD US BEARING A MIGHTY STONE CUDGEL
302-123504-0002 WITH WHICH IT EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO BRAIN ME THE CREATURES WERE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET TALL STANDING ERECT AND HAD LIKE THE GREEN MARTIANS AN INTERMEDIARY SET OF ARMS OR LEGS
302-123504-0003 MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS THEIR EYES WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND NON PROTRUDING THEIR EARS WERE HIGH SET BUT MORE LATERALLY LOCATED THAN THOSE OF THE MARTIANS
302-123504-0004 WHEN A BOLT OF MYRIAD LEGGED HORROR HURLED ITSELF THROUGH THE DOORWAY FULL UPON THE BREAST OF MY EXECUTIONER WITH A SHRIEK OF FEAR THE APE WHICH HELD ME LEAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW BUT ITS MATE CLOSED IN A TERRIFIC
302-123504-0005 DEATH STRUGGLE WITH MY PRESERVER WHICH WAS NOTHING LESS THAN MY FAITHFUL WATCH THING I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL SO HIDEOUS A CREATURE A DOG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I GAINED MY FEET AND BACKING AGAINST THE WALL I WITNESSED SUCH A
302-123504-0006 BATTLE AS IT IS VOUCHSAFED FEW BEINGS TO SEE THE STRENGTH AGILITY AND BLIND FEROCITY OF THESE TWO CREATURES IS APPROACHED BY NOTHING KNOWN TO EARTHLY MAN
302-123504-0007 MY BEAST HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS FIRST HOLD HAVING SUNK HIS MIGHTY FANGS FAR INTO THE BREAST OF HIS ADVERSARY BUT THE GREAT ARMS AND PAWS OF THE APE
302-123504-0008 BACKED BY MUSCLES FAR TRANSCENDING THOSE OF THE MARTIAN MEN I HAD SEEN HAD LOCKED THE THROAT OF MY GUARDIAN AND SLOWLY WERE CHOKING OUT HIS LIFE AND BENDING BACK HIS HEAD AND NECK UPON HIS BODY
302-123504-0009 WHERE I MOMENTARILY EXPECTED THE FORMER TO FALL LIMP AT THE END OF A BROKEN NECK IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS THE APE WAS TEARING AWAY THE ENTIRE FRONT OF ITS BREAST WHICH WAS HELD IN THE VISE LIKE GRIP OF THE POWERFUL JAWS
302-123504-0010 BACK AND FORTH UPON THE FLOOR THEY ROLLED NEITHER ONE EMITTING A SOUND OF FEAR OR PAIN PRESENTLY I SAW THE GREAT EYES OF MY BEAST BULGING COMPLETELY FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND BLOOD FLOWING FROM ITS NOSTRILS
302-123504-0011 BUT SO ALSO WAS THE APE WHOSE STRUGGLES WERE GROWING MOMENTARILY LESS SUDDENLY I CAME TO MYSELF
302-123504-0012 I SEIZED THE CUDGEL WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE BATTLE AND SWINGING IT WITH ALL THE POWER OF MY EARTHLY ARMS I CRASHED IT FULL UPON THE HEAD OF THE APE CRUSHING HIS SKULL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN EGGSHELL
302-123504-0013 SCARCELY HAD THE BLOW DESCENDED WHEN I WAS CONFRONTED WITH A NEW DANGER THE APE'S MATE RECOVERED FROM ITS FIRST SHOCK OF TERROR HAD RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF THE ENCOUNTER BY WAY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING
302-123504-0014 I GLIMPSED HIM JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOORWAY AND THE SIGHT OF HIM NOW ROARING AS HE PERCEIVED HIS LIFELESS FELLOW STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS RAGE FILLED ME I MUST CONFESS
302-123504-0015 WITH DIRE FOREBODINGS I AM EVER WILLING TO STAND AND FIGHT WHEN THE ODDS ARE NOT TOO OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I PERCEIVED NEITHER GLORY NOR PROFIT
302-123504-0016 AGAINST THE IRON MUSCLES AND BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THIS ENRAGED DENIZEN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN FACT THE ONLY OUTCOME OF SUCH AN ENCOUNTER SO FAR AS I MIGHT BE CONCERNED SEEMED SUDDEN DEATH
302-123504-0017 I WAS STANDING NEAR THE WINDOW AND I KNEW THAT ONCE IN THE STREET I MIGHT GAIN THE PLAZA AND SAFETY BEFORE THE CREATURE COULD OVERTAKE ME AT LEAST THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
302-123504-0018 AGAINST ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH SHOULD I REMAIN AND FIGHT HOWEVER DESPERATELY IT IS TRUE I HELD THE CUDGEL BUT WHAT COULD I DO WITH IT AGAINST HIS FOUR GREAT ARMS
302-123504-0019 EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
302-123504-0020 IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
302-123504-0021 HIS GREAT EYES FASTENED UPON ME IN WHAT SEEMED A PITIFUL APPEAL FOR PROTECTION I COULD NOT WITHSTAND THAT LOOK NOR COULD I ON SECOND THOUGHT HAVE DESERTED MY RESCUER WITHOUT GIVING AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF IN HIS BEHALF
302-123504-0022 AS HE HAD IN MINE WITHOUT MORE ADO THEREFORE I TURNED TO MEET THE CHARGE OF THE INFURIATED BULL APE HE WAS NOW TOO CLOSE UPON ME FOR THE CUDGEL TO PROVE OF ANY EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE
302-123504-0023 SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
302-123504-0024 WITH ARMS WIDE STRETCHED TO EASE HIS FALL AGAIN AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY I HAD RECOURSE TO EARTHLY TACTICS AND SWINGING MY RIGHT FIST FULL UPON THE POINT OF HIS CHIN
302-123504-0025 I BEHELD TARS TARKAS SOLA AND THREE OR FOUR WARRIORS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE CHAMBER AS MY EYES MET THEIRS I WAS FOR THE SECOND TIME THE RECIPIENT OF THEIR ZEALOUSLY GUARDED APPLAUSE
302-123504-0026 MY ABSENCE HAD BEEN NOTED BY SOLA ON HER AWAKENING AND SHE HAD QUICKLY INFORMED TARS TARKAS WHO HAD SET OUT IMMEDIATELY WITH A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS TO SEARCH FOR ME AS THEY HAD APPROACHED THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
302-123504-0027 THIS ENCOUNTER TOGETHER WITH MY SET TO WITH THE MARTIAN WARRIOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND MY FEATS OF JUMPING PLACED ME UPON A HIGH PINNACLE IN THEIR REGARD EVIDENTLY DEVOID OF ALL THE FINER SENTIMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP
302-123504-0028 LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
302-123504-0029 STRENGTH AND COURAGE SOLA WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED THE SEARCHING PARTY OF HER OWN VOLITION WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MARTIANS WHOSE FACE HAD NOT BEEN TWISTED IN LAUGHTER AS I BATTLED FOR MY LIFE SHE ON THE CONTRARY
302-123504-0030 WAS SOBER WITH APPARENT SOLICITUDE AND AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE MONSTER RUSHED TO ME AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED MY BODY FOR POSSIBLE WOUNDS OR INJURIES SATISFYING HERSELF THAT I HAD COME OFF UNSCATHED SHE SMILED QUIETLY
302-123504-0031 AND TAKING MY HAND STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER TARS TARKAS AND THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD ENTERED AND WERE STANDING OVER THE NOW RAPIDLY REVIVING BRUTE WHICH HAD SAVED MY LIFE
302-123504-0032 THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
302-123504-0033 AND TURNED TO FOLLOW US FROM THE ROOM THERE SEEMED SOMETHING MENACING IN THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD MY BEAST AND I HESITATED TO LEAVE UNTIL I HAD LEARNED THE OUTCOME IT WAS WELL I DID SO FOR THE WARRIOR DREW AN
302-123504-0034 EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
302-123504-0035 BLOWING A HOLE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WOOD AND MASONRY I THEN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE FEARSOME LOOKING THING AND RAISING IT TO ITS FEET MOTIONED FOR IT TO FOLLOW ME
302-123504-0036 AND SOLA GRASPING ME TIGHTLY BY THE ARM I HAD AT LEAST TWO FRIENDS ON MARS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WATCHED OVER ME WITH MOTHERLY SOLICITUDE AND A DUMB BRUTE WHICH AS I LATER CAME TO KNOW
302-123504-0037 HELD IN ITS POOR UGLY CARCASS MORE LOVE MORE LOYALTY MORE GRATITUDE
302-123516-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHAINED IN WARHOON IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
302-123516-0001 AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
302-123516-0002 RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
302-123516-0003 HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
302-123516-0004 AND DEPENDING FROM THESE A NUMBER OF DRIED HUMAN HANDS HIS REFERENCE TO THE GREAT GAMES OF WHICH I HAD HEARD SO MUCH WHILE AMONG THE THARKS CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD BUT JUMPED FROM PURGATORY INTO GEHENNA
302-123516-0005 AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH THE FEMALE DURING WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOW FULLY FIT TO TRAVEL THE JED ORDERED THAT WE MOUNT AND RIDE AFTER THE MAIN COLUMN
302-123516-0006 I WAS STRAPPED SECURELY TO AS WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE A THOAT AS I HAD EVER SEEN AND WITH A MOUNTED WARRIOR ON EITHER SIDE TO PREVENT THE BEAST FROM BOLTING
302-123516-0007 WE RODE FORTH AT A FURIOUS PACE IN PURSUIT OF THE COLUMN MY WOUNDS GAVE ME BUT LITTLE PAIN SO WONDERFULLY AND RAPIDLY HAD THE APPLICATIONS AND INJECTIONS OF THE FEMALE EXERCISED THEIR THERAPEUTIC POWERS
302-123516-0008 WHO PROVED TO BE THE JEDDAK OF THE HORDES OF WARHOON LIKE THE JED WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY SCARRED AND ALSO DECORATED WITH THE BREASTPLATE OF HUMAN SKULLS AND DRIED DEAD HANDS
302-123516-0009 WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
302-123516-0010 WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
302-123516-0011 HE ENTIRELY OMITTED THE USUAL FORMAL SALUTATION AS WE ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE JEDDAK AND AS HE PUSHED ME ROUGHLY BEFORE THE RULER HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD AND MENACING VOICE
302-123516-0012 I HAVE BROUGHT A STRANGE CREATURE WEARING THE METAL OF A THARK WHOM IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAVE BATTLE WITH A WILD THOAT AT THE GREAT GAMES HE WILL DIE AS BAR COMAS YOUR JEDDAK SEES FIT IF AT ALL
302-123516-0013 WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
302-123516-0014 RATHER THAN BY A WATER HEARTED WEAKLING FROM WHOM EVEN OLD DAK KOVA COULD TEAR THE METAL WITH HIS BARE HANDS BAR COMAS EYED THE DEFIANT AND INSUBORDINATE CHIEFTAIN FOR AN INSTANT HIS EXPRESSION ONE OF HAUGHTY
302-123516-0015 FEARLESS CONTEMPT AND HATE AND THEN WITHOUT DRAWING A WEAPON AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE HURLED HIMSELF AT THE THROAT OF HIS DEFAMER
302-123516-0016 I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN TWO GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS BATTLE WITH NATURE'S WEAPONS AND THE EXHIBITION OF ANIMAL FEROCITY WHICH ENSUED WAS AS FEARFUL A THING AS THE MOST DISORDERED IMAGINATION COULD PICTURE
302-123516-0017 BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
302-123516-0018 BREAKING AWAY FROM A CLINCH IT WAS THE ONE LITTLE OPENING THAT DAK KOVA NEEDED AND HURLING HIMSELF AT THE BODY OF HIS ADVERSARY
302-123516-0019 AND WITH A LAST POWERFUL EFFORT RIPPED THE YOUNG JEDDAK WIDE OPEN THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BODY THE GREAT TUSK
302-123516-0020 VICTOR AND VANQUISHED ROLLED LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE MOSS A HUGE MASS OF TORN AND BLOODY FLESH
302-123516-0021 BAR COMAS WAS STONE DEAD AND ONLY THE MOST HERCULEAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF DAK KOVA'S FEMALES SAVED HIM FROM THE FATE HE DESERVED THREE DAYS LATER HE WALKED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO THE BODY OF BAR COMAS WHICH
302-123516-0022 BY CUSTOM HAD NOT BEEN MOVED FROM WHERE IT FELL AND PLACING HIS FOOT UPON THE NECK OF HIS ERSTWHILE RULER HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF JEDDAK OF WARHOON
302-123516-0023 THE INJURIES TO DAK KOVA HAD DELAYED THE MARCH SO GREATLY THAT IT WAS DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHICH WAS A RAID UPON A SMALL THARK COMMUNITY IN RETALIATION FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INCUBATOR UNTIL AFTER THE GREAT GAMES
302-123516-0024 THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
302-123516-0025 FOOD WAS BROUGHT ME AT INTERVALS BUT OWING TO THE UTTER DARKNESS OF THE PLACE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I LAY THERE DAYS OR WEEKS OR MONTHS IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF ALL MY LIFE
302-123516-0026 AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
302-123516-0027 AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
302-123516-0028 ALTHOUGH I AT FIRST BOMBARDED HIM WITH QUESTIONS FINALLY ALL THE HATRED AND MANIACAL LOATHING FOR THESE AWFUL CREATURES WHO HAD PLACED ME IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WAS CENTERED BY MY TOTTERING REASON UPON THIS SINGLE EMISSARY
302-123516-0029 WHO REPRESENTED TO ME THE ENTIRE HORDE OF WARHOONS I HAD NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS ADVANCED WITH HIS DIM TORCH TO WHERE HE COULD PLACE THE FOOD WITHIN MY REACH AND AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE IT UPON THE FLOOR
302-123516-0030 SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
302-123516-0031 I WAITED HIS COMING CROUCHING LIKE SOME BEAST OF PREY AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE MY FOOD UPON THE GROUND I SWUNG THE CHAIN ABOVE MY HEAD AND CRASHED THE LINKS WITH ALL MY STRENGTH UPON HIS SKULL WITHOUT A SOUND
302-123516-0032 HE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR STONE DEAD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING LIKE THE IDIOT I WAS FAST BECOMING
302-123516-0033 NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
302-123516-0034 BACK INTO MY CORNER I CROUCHED
302-123516-0035 AND STEALTHILY ON CAME THE AWFUL EYES UNTIL THEY REACHED THE DEAD BODY AT MY FEET THEN SLOWLY THEY RETREATED BUT THIS TIME WITH A STRANGE GRATING SOUND
302-123523-0000 THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
302-123523-0001 WHICH I NEGOTIATED EASILY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE ONCE INSIDE HOWEVER THE GATE GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
302-123523-0002 AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS
302-123523-0003 THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
302-123523-0004 AND SO I CAME CLOSE AND PEERED WITHIN AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS SAT THAN KOSIS AND HIS CONSORT
302-123523-0005 SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
302-123523-0006 THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
302-123523-0007 AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
302-123523-0008 TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
302-123523-0009 THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
302-123523-0010 FOR IT WAS SAB THAN PRINCE OF ZODANGA WHO STOOD REVEALED BEFORE ME THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS AND PLACED ONE OF THE COLLARS OF GOLD ABOUT HIS SON'S NECK
302-123523-0011 SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
302-123523-0012 BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
302-123523-0013 I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
302-123523-0014 RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0015 WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
302-123523-0016 BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0017 AND AGAIN WE FACED EACH OTHER HE WAS SOON JOINED BY A QUARTET OF OFFICERS AND WITH MY BACK AGAINST A GOLDEN THRONE I FOUGHT ONCE AGAIN FOR DEJAH THORIS I WAS HARD PRESSED TO DEFEND MYSELF
302-123523-0018 AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN
302-123523-0019 WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
302-123523-0020 CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
302-123523-0021 THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
302-123523-0022 WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET
302-123523-0023 NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
302-123523-0024 AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
302-123523-0025 AND LEAVING DEJAH THORIS IN CHARGE OF TARS TARKAS I TOOK A DOZEN WARRIORS AND HASTENED TO THE DUNGEONS BENEATH THE PALACE THE JAILERS HAD ALL LEFT TO JOIN THE FIGHTERS IN THE THRONE ROOM SO WE SEARCHED THE LABYRINTHINE PRISON WITHOUT OPPOSITION
302-123523-0026 I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
302-123523-0027 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
302-123523-0028 SO THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN SAB THAN WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT AWAY THE BARS AND CHAINS WHICH HELD HIM PRISONER SO AT HIS SUGGESTION
302-123523-0029 FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
302-123523-0030 AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
302-123523-0031 CAN IT BE THAT ALL EARTH MEN ARE AS YOU ALONE A STRANGER HUNTED THREATENED PERSECUTED YOU HAVE DONE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS WHAT IN ALL THE PAST AGES OF BARSOOM NO MAN HAS EVER DONE
302-123523-0032 JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
302-123523-0033 LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
302-123523-0034 FOR I AM FREE AND MORE STILL I HAVE TO SAY ERE IT IS AGAIN TOO LATE I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED
302-123523-0035 BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF FOR NEVER HAD I DREAMED THAT IN ALL THE UNIVERSE DWELT SUCH A WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM
302-123523-0036 BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME DOUBT MY SANITY AS I ASK YOU MY PRINCESS TO BE MINE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ABASHED WHO SO WELL KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS PLEA
302-123523-0037 BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
302-123523-0038 WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
3240-131231-0000 ATTEMPTS TO PRESERVE THE SYSTEM THAT SMALL FROGS AND TOADS FOR INSTANCE NEVER HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY BUT WERE ON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE OR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH FALLS UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
3240-131231-0001 WERE THERE SOME ESPECIALLY FROGGY PLACE NEAR EUROPE AS THERE IS AN ESPECIALLY SANDY PLACE THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION WOULD OF COURSE BE THAT ALL SMALL FROGS FALLING FROM THE SKY IN EUROPE COME FROM THAT CENTER OF FROGEITY TO START WITH
3240-131231-0002 I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT I AM PERMITTED TO SEE BECAUSE I AM STILL PRIMITIVE OR INTELLIGENT OR IN A STATE OF MALADJUSTMENT
3240-131231-0003 OF A FALL OF TADPOLES FROM THE SKY AS TO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0004 THE WRITER SAYS THAT ALL OBSERVERS WERE MISTAKEN THAT THE FROGS OR TOADS MUST HAVE FALLEN FROM TREES OR OTHER PLACES OVERHEAD TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF LITTLE TOADS ONE OR TWO MONTHS OLD
3240-131231-0005 THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM A GREAT THICK CLOUD THAT APPEARED SUDDENLY IN A SKY THAT HAD BEEN CLOUDLESS AUGUST EIGHTEEN O FOUR NEAR TOULOUSE FRANCE ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM PROFESSOR PONTUS TO M ARAGO
3240-131231-0006 MANY INSTANCES OF FROGS THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0007 AS TO HAVING BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0008 JULY THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0009 LITTLE TOADS FOUND IN A DESERT AFTER A RAINFALL NOTES AND QUERIES
3240-131231-0010 TO START WITH I DO NOT DENY POSITIVELY THE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION OF UP AND DOWN I THINK THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SUCH OCCURRENCES I OMIT MANY NOTES THAT I HAVE UPON INDISTINGUISHABLES
3240-131231-0011 IN THE LONDON TIMES JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF A SHOWER OF TWIGS AND LEAVES AND TINY TOADS IN A STORM UPON THE SLOPES OF THE APENNINES THESE MAY HAVE BEEN THE EJECTAMENTA OF A WHIRLWIND I ADD HOWEVER
3240-131231-0012 THAT I HAVE NOTES UPON TWO OTHER FALLS OF TINY TOADS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE ONE IN FRANCE AND ONE IN TAHITI ALSO OF FISH IN SCOTLAND BUT IN THE PHENOMENON OF THE APENNINES THE MIXTURE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF THE PRODUCTS OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0013 THE OTHER INSTANCES SEEM TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF SOMETHING LIKE MIGRATION THEIR GREAT NUMBERS AND THEIR HOMOGENEITY OVER AND OVER IN THESE ANNALS OF THE DAMNED OCCURS THE DATUM OF SEGREGATION
3240-131231-0014 BUT A WHIRLWIND IS THOUGHT OF AS A CONDITION OF CHAOS QUASI CHAOS
3240-131231-0015 MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JULY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE A SMALL POND IN THE TRACK OF THE CLOUD WAS SUCKED DRY THE WATER BEING CARRIED OVER THE ADJOINING FIELDS TOGETHER WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF SOFT MUD WHICH WAS SCATTERED OVER THE GROUND FOR HALF A MILE AROUND
3240-131231-0016 BUT HERE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SCOOP IN THE EXCLUSIONIST IMAGINATION THERE IS NO REGARD FOR MUD DEBRIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF A POND FLOATING VEGETATION LOOSE THINGS FROM THE SHORES BUT A PRECISE PICKING OUT OF FROGS ONLY
3240-131231-0017 OF ALL INSTANCES I HAVE THAT ATTRIBUTE THE FALL OF SMALL FROGS OR TOADS TO WHIRLWINDS ONLY ONE DEFINITELY IDENTIFIES OR PLACES THE WHIRLWIND ALSO AS HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE A POND GOING UP WOULD BE QUITE AS INTERESTING AS FROGS COMING DOWN
3240-131231-0018 WHIRLWINDS WE READ OF OVER AND OVER BUT WHERE AND WHAT WHIRLWIND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANYBODY WHO HAD LOST A POND WOULD BE HEARD FROM IN SYMONS METEOROLOGICAL MAGAZINE
3240-131231-0019 A FALL OF SMALL FROGS NEAR BIRMINGHAM ENGLAND JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO IS ATTRIBUTED TO A SPECIFIC WHIRLWIND BUT NOT A WORD AS TO ANY SPECIAL POND THAT HAD CONTRIBUTED
3240-131231-0020 AND SOMETHING THAT STRIKES MY ATTENTION HERE IS THAT THESE FROGS ARE DESCRIBED AS ALMOST WHITE I'M AFRAID THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR US WE SHALL HAVE TO GIVE TO CIVILIZATION UPON THIS EARTH SOME NEW WORLDS PLACES WITH WHITE FROGS IN THEM
3240-131231-0021 IN SPITE OF ALL WE THINK WE KNOW OF THE ACCELERATIVE VELOCITY OF FALLING BODIES AND HAVE PROPAGATED WHY THE EXOTIC BECOMES THE INDIGENOUS OR FROM THE STRANGEST OF PLACES WE'D EXPECT THE FAMILIAR OR
3240-131231-0022 IF HOSTS OF LIVING FROGS HAVE COME HERE FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE EVERY LIVING THING UPON THIS EARTH MAY ANCESTRALLY HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE I FIND THAT I HAVE ANOTHER NOTE UPON A SPECIFIC HURRICANE
3240-131231-0023 AFTER ONE OF THE GREATEST HURRICANES IN THE HISTORY OF IRELAND SOME FISH WERE FOUND AS FAR AS FIFTEEN YARDS FROM THE EDGE OF A LAKE HAVE ANOTHER THIS IS A GOOD ONE FOR THE EXCLUSIONISTS FALL OF FISH IN PARIS SAID THAT A NEIGHBORING POND HAD BEEN BLOWN DRY
3240-131231-0024 DATE NOT GIVEN BUT I HAVE SEEN IT RECORDED SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BEST KNOWN FALL OF FISHES FROM THE SKY IS THAT WHICH OCCURRED AT MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0025 FEBRUARY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE THE EDITOR OF THE ZOOLOGIST
3240-131231-0026 HAVING PUBLISHED A REPORT OF A FALL OF FISHES WRITES I AM CONTINUALLY RECEIVING SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF FROGS AND FISHES BUT IN ALL THE VOLUMES OF THE ZOOLOGIST I CAN FIND ONLY TWO REPORTS OF SUCH FALLS THERE IS NOTHING TO CONCLUDE
3240-131231-0027 OTHER THAN THAT HOSTS OF DATA HAVE BEEN LOST BECAUSE ORTHODOXY DOES NOT LOOK FAVORABLY UPON SUCH REPORTS THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW RECORDS SEVERAL FALLS OF FISHES IN THE UNITED STATES
3240-131231-0028 NEVERTHELESS THE TREATMENT BY THE ZOOLOGIST OF THE FALL REPORTED FROM MOUNTAIN ASH IS FAIR FIRST APPEARS
3240-131231-0029 VICAR OF ABEDARE ASSERTING THAT THE FALL HAD OCCURRED CHIEFLY UPON THE PROPERTY OF MISTER NIXON OF MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0030 OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BRISTLING WITH EXCLUSIONISM WRITES THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM ALIVE WERE VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HE SAYS ON READING THE EVIDENCE IT SEEMS TO ME MOST PROBABLY ONLY A PRACTICAL JOKE
3240-131231-0031 THE EDITOR SAYS THAT ONE WAS A MINNOW AND THAT THE REST WERE STICKLEBACKS HE SAYS THAT DOCTOR GRAY'S EXPLANATION IS NO DOUBT RIGHT BUT
3240-131231-0032 HE PUBLISHES A LETTER FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT WHO APOLOGIZES FOR OPPOSING SO HIGH AN AUTHORITY AS DOCTOR GRAY BUT SAYS THAT HE HAD OBTAINED SOME OF THESE FISHES FROM PERSONS WHO LIVED AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE APART
3240-131231-0033 OR CONSIDERABLY OUT OF RANGE OF THE PLAYFUL PAIL OF WATER ACCORDING TO THE ANNUAL REGISTER
3240-131231-0034 THE FISHES THEMSELVES HAD FALLEN BY PAILFULS IF THESE FISHES WERE NOT UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE WE BASE OUR OBJECTIONS TO THE WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION UPON TWO DATA THAT THEY FELL IN NO SUCH DISTRIBUTION AS ONE COULD ATTRIBUTE TO THE DISCHARGE OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0035 THAT TEN MINUTES LATER ANOTHER FALL OF FISHES OCCURRED UPON THIS SAME NARROW STRIP OF LAND EVEN ARGUING THAT A WHIRLWIND MAY STAND STILL AXIALLY IT DISCHARGES TANGENTIALLY WHEREVER THE FISHES CAME FROM IT DOES NOT SEEM THINKABLE
3240-131231-0036 THAT SOME COULD HAVE FALLEN AND THAT OTHERS COULD HAVE WHIRLED EVEN A TENTH OF A MINUTE THEN FALLING DIRECTLY AFTER THE FIRST TO FALL BECAUSE OF THESE EVIL CIRCUMSTANCES THE BEST ADAPTATION WAS TO LAUGH THE WHOLE THING OFF
3240-131231-0037 VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HAD BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH SECOND EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE IS A LETTER FROM MISTER AARON ROBERTS CURATE OF SAINT PETER'S CARMATHON IN THIS LETTER
3240-131231-0038 BUT THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF SPECIES I THINK MYSELF THAT THEY WERE MINNOWS AND STICKLEBACKS SOME PERSONS THINKING THEM TO BE SEA FISHES PLACED THEM IN SALT WATER ACCORDING TO MISTER ROBERTS
3240-131231-0039 SOME WERE PLACED IN FRESH WATER THESE SEEMED TO THRIVE WELL AS TO NARROW DISTRIBUTION WE ARE TOLD THAT THE FISHES FELL IN AND ABOUT THE PREMISES OF MISTER NIXON IT WAS NOT OBSERVED AT THE TIME THAT ANY FISH FELL IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
3240-131231-0040 SAVE IN THE PARTICULAR SPOT MENTIONED IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE VICAR GRIFFITH WRITES AN ACCOUNT THE ROOFS OF SOME HOUSES WERE COVERED WITH THEM
3240-131231-0041 IN THIS LETTER IT IS SAID THAT THE LARGEST FISHES WERE FIVE INCHES LONG AND THAT THESE DID NOT SURVIVE THE FALL REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION
3240-131231-0042 THE EVIDENCE OF THE FALL OF FISH ON THIS OCCASION WAS VERY CONCLUSIVE A SPECIMEN OF THE FISH WAS EXHIBITED
3240-131231-0043 LEIRUS GASTEROSTEUS IS THE STICKLEBACK ALTOGETHER I THINK WE HAVE NOT A SENSE OF TOTAL PERDITION
3240-131231-0044 IN WHICH WERE THOUSANDS OF FISHES FOUR OR FIVE INCHES LONG SOME OF WHICH COVERED ROOFS OF HOUSES AND SOME OF WHICH REMAINED TEN MINUTES IN THE AIR BY WAY OF CONTRAST WE OFFER OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE THAT THE BOTTOM OF A SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL POND HAD DROPPED OUT
3240-131231-0045 I HAVE A GREAT MANY NOTES UPON THE FALL OF FISHES DESPITE THE DIFFICULTY THESE RECORDS HAVE IN GETTING THEMSELVES PUBLISHED BUT I PICK OUT THE INSTANCES THAT ESPECIALLY RELATE TO OUR SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL ACCEPTANCES
3240-131231-0046 THAT HAVE FALLEN WITH A DISTRIBUTION NARROWER THAN IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A WHIRLWIND THAT HAVE FALLEN FOR A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME UPON THE SAME NARROW AREA OF LAND THESE THREE FACTORS INDICATE SOMEWHERE NOT FAR ALOFT
3240-131231-0047 A REGION OF INERTNESS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION OF COURSE HOWEVER A REGION THAT BY THE FLUX AND VARIATION OF ALL THINGS MUST AT TIMES BE SUSCEPTIBLE BUT AFTERWARD OUR HERESY WILL BIFURCATE
3240-131231-0048 IN AMIABLE ACCOMMODATION TO THE CRUCIFIXION IT'LL GET I THINK BUT SO IMPRESSED ARE WE WITH THE DATUM THAT THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF SMALL FROGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0049 THAT TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ANOTHER ADJUSTMENT MUST BE MADE APART FROM OUR THREE FACTORS OF INDICATION AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVATION IS THE FALL OF LIVING THINGS WITHOUT INJURY TO THEM
3240-131231-0050 SOMETHING ELSE APART FROM OUR THREE MAIN INTERESTS IS A PHENOMENON THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL AN ALTERNATING SERIES OF FALLS OF FISHES WHATEVER THE SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE
3240-131231-0051 JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0052 FIFESHIRE SCOTLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR
3240-131231-0053 MORADABAD INDIA JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0054 ROSS SHIRE SCOTLAND EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0055 MORADABAD INDIA JULY TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE
3240-131231-0056 FERIDPOOR INDIA FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY
3240-131231-0057 DISREGARDING SERIAL SIGNIFICANCE OR MECHANICAL UNINTELLIGENT REPULSIVE REFLEX IS THAT THE FISHES OF INDIA DID NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY WERE FOUND UPON THE GROUND AFTER TORRENTIAL RAINS BECAUSE STREAMS HAD OVERFLOWED AND HAD THEN RECEDED
3240-131231-0058 IN THE REGION OF INERTNESS THAT WE THINK WE CAN CONCEIVE OF OR A ZONE THAT IS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION VERY MUCH LIKE THE NEUTRAL ZONE OF A MAGNET'S ATTRACTION WE ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE BODIES OF WATER AND ALSO CLEAR SPACES BOTTOMS OF PONDS DROPPING OUT
3240-131231-0059 REMAIN AND DRY OR EVEN PUTREFY THEN SOMETIMES FALLING BY ATMOSPHERIC DISLODGMENT AFTER A TREMENDOUS DELUGE OF RAIN ONE OF THE HEAVIEST FALLS ON RECORD
3240-131231-0060 JULY TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY
3240-131231-0061 THE WORD FOUND IS AGREEABLE TO THE REPULSIONS OF THE CONVENTIONALISTS AND THEIR CONCEPT OF AN OVERFLOWING STREAM BUT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE FOUND ON THE TOPS OF HAYSTACKS FERREL
3240-131231-0062 TELLS OF A FALL OF LIVING FISHES SOME OF THEM HAVING BEEN PLACED IN A TANK WHERE THEY SURVIVED THAT OCCURRED IN INDIA ABOUT TWENTY MILES SOUTH OF CALCUTTA SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE A WITNESS OF THIS FALL SAYS
3240-131231-0063 THE MOST STRANGE THING WHICH EVER STRUCK ME WAS THAT THE FISH DID NOT FALL HELTER SKELTER OR HERE AND THERE BUT THEY FELL IN A STRAIGHT LINE NOT MORE THAN A CUBIT IN BREADTH
3240-131231-0064 THAT ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY TAKEN BEFORE A MAGISTRATE A FALL OCCURRED FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NEAR FERIDPOOR INDIA OF MANY FISHES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME WHOLE AND FRESH AND OTHERS MUTILATED AND PUTREFYING
3240-131231-0065 OR TO THOSE WHO HOLD OUT FOR SEGREGATION IN A WHIRLWIND OR THAT OBJECTS SAY TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE LIGHTER WE POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS IN THE JOURNAL OF THE ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL
3240-131231-0066 SOME OF THE FISH WERE FRESH BUT OTHERS WERE ROTTEN AND WITHOUT HEADS AMONG THE NUMBER WHICH I GOT FIVE WERE FRESH AND THE REST STINKING AND HEADLESS THEY REMIND US OF HIS GRACE'S OBSERVATION OF SOME PAGES BACK
3240-131231-0067 ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WEIGHED ONE AND A HALF POUNDS EACH AND OTHERS THREE POUNDS A FALL OF FISHES AT FUTTEPOOR INDIA MAY SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE THEY WERE ALL DEAD AND DRY
3240-131231-0068 A CORRESPONDENT WRITES FROM THE DOVE MARINE LABORATORY CUTTERCOATS ENGLAND THAT AT HINDON A SUBURB OF SUNDERLAND AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS OF SMALL FISHES IDENTIFIED AS SAND EELS HAD FALLEN
3240-131231-0069 AGAIN THE SMALL AREA ABOUT SIXTY BY THIRTY YARDS THE FALL OCCURRED DURING A HEAVY RAIN THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER
3240-131231-0070 BUT BY NO VISIBLE LIGHTNING THE SEA IS CLOSE TO HINDON BUT IF YOU TRY TO THINK OF THESE FISHES HAVING DESCRIBED A TRAJECTORY IN A WHIRLWIND FROM THE OCEAN CONSIDER THIS REMARKABLE DATUM THAT
3240-131231-0071 ACCORDING TO WITNESSES THE FALL UPON THIS SMALL AREA OCCUPIED TEN MINUTES I CANNOT THINK OF A CLEARER INDICATION OF A DIRECT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND
3240-131231-0072 THE FISH WERE ALL DEAD AND INDEED STIFF AND HARD WHEN PICKED UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OCCURRENCE BY ALL OF WHICH I MEAN THAT WE HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO PILE UP OUR DATA OF THINGS THAT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE OVERHEAD
3240-131231-0073 WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP THE SUBJECT FROM MANY APPROACHES BEFORE OUR ACCEPTANCE WHICH SEEMS QUITE AS RIGOROUSLY ARRIVED AT AS EVER HAS BEEN A BELIEF CAN EMERGE FROM THE ACCURSED I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE HORSE AND THE BARN WILL HELP US TO EMERGE
3240-131231-0074 BUT IF EVER ANYTHING DID GO UP FROM THIS EARTH'S SURFACE AND STAY UP THOSE DAMNED THINGS MAY HAVE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN A TORNADO IN WISCONSIN MAY TWENTY THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0075 A BARN AND A HORSE WERE CARRIED COMPLETELY AWAY AND NEITHER HORSE NOR BARN NOR ANY PORTION OF EITHER HAVE SINCE BEEN FOUND AFTER THAT WHICH WOULD BE A LITTLE STRONG WERE IT NOT FOR A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN OUR DIGESTIONS THAT I NOTE AS WE GO ALONG
3240-131231-0076 THERE IS LITTLE OF THE BIZARRE OR THE UNASSIMILABLE IN THE TURTLE THAT HOVERED SIX MONTHS OR SO OVER A SMALL TOWN IN MISSISSIPPI MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131231-0077 FELL A SMALL PIECE OF ALABASTER THAT AT BOVINA EIGHT MILES FROM VICKSBURG FELL A GOPHER TURTLE THEY FELL IN A HAILSTORM THIS ITEM WAS WIDELY COPIED AT THE TIME FOR INSTANCE NATURE
3240-131231-0078 AS TO DISCUSSION NOT A WORD OR SCIENCE AND ITS CONTINUITY WITH PRESBYTERIANISM DATA LIKE THIS ARE DAMNED AT BIRTH THE WEATHER REVIEW DOES SPRINKLE OR BAPTIZE OR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THIS INFANT
3240-131231-0079 BUT IN ALL THE METEOROLOGICAL LITERATURE THAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH AFTER THAT DATE NOT A WORD EXCEPT MENTION ONCE OR TWICE THE EDITOR OF THE REVIEW SAYS
3240-131231-0080 AN EXAMINATION OF THE WEATHER MAP SHOWS THAT THESE HAILSTORMS OCCUR ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF A REGION OF COLD NORTHERLY WINDS AND WERE BUT A SMALL PART OF A SERIES OF SIMILAR STORMS
3240-131231-0081 OF ALL INCREDIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM I GIVE FIRST PLACE TO A NOTION OF A WHIRLWIND POUNCING UPON A REGION
3240-131231-0082 THIS TIME THE OTHER MECHANICAL THING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE CANNOT RISE IN RESPONSE TO ITS STIMULUS IT IS RESISTED IN THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE COATED WITH ICE MONTH OF MAY IN A SOUTHERN STATE IF A WHIRLWIND AT ALL
3240-131231-0083 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED SELECTION THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE FALL OF OTHER OBJECTS BUT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT IN THE REVIEW TO SPECIFY A WHIRLWIND THESE STRANGELY ASSOCIATED THINGS WERE REMARKABLY SEPARATED THEY FELL EIGHT MILES APART
3240-131231-0084 THEN AS IF THERE WERE REAL REASONING THEY MUST HAVE BEEN HIGH TO FALL WITH SUCH DIVERGENCE OR ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED PARTLY HORIZONTALLY EIGHT MILES FARTHER THAN THE OTHER BUT EITHER SUPPOSITION ARGUES FOR POWER MORE THAN THAT OF A LOCAL WHIRL OR GUST
3240-131231-0085 OR ARGUES FOR A GREAT SPECIFIC DISTURBANCE OF WHICH THERE IS NO RECORD FOR THE MONTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131232-0000 THEN I THINK OF A HURRICANE THAT OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WEEKS OR MONTHS BEFORE MAY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR NO I DON'T LOOK FOR IT AND INEVITABLY FIND IT OR THAT THINGS CAN GO UP SO HIGH IN HURRICANES THAT THEY STAY UP INDEFINITELY
3240-131232-0001 BUT MAY AFTER A WHILE BE SHAKEN DOWN BY STORMS
3240-131232-0002 SO THEN THAT THE TURTLE AND THE PIECE OF ALABASTER MAY HAVE HAD FAR DIFFERENT ORIGINS FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS PERHAPS HAVE ENTERED A REGION OF SUSPENSION OVER THIS EARTH WAFTING NEAR EACH OTHER LONG DURATION
3240-131232-0003 FINAL PRECIPITATION BY ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WITH HAIL OR THAT HAILSTONES TOO WHEN LARGE ARE PHENOMENA OF SUSPENSION OF LONG DURATION THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE VERY LARGE ONES COULD BECOME SO GREAT ONLY IN FALLING FROM THE CLOUDS
3240-131232-0004 LONG DURATION OTHER INDICATIONS OF LONG DURATION I THINK OF A REGION SOMEWHERE ABOVE THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN WHICH GRAVITATION IS INOPERATIVE AND IS NOT GOVERNED BY THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE
3240-131232-0005 QUITE AS MAGNETISM IS NEGLIGIBLE AT A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FROM A MAGNET THEORETICALLY THE ATTRACTION OF A MAGNET SHOULD DECREASE WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BUT THE FALLING OFF IS FOUND TO BE ALMOST ABRUPT AT A SHORT DISTANCE
3240-131232-0006 HORSES AND BARNS AND ELEPHANTS AND FLIES AND DODOES MOAS AND PTERODACTYLS LEAVES FROM MODERN TREES AND LEAVES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS ERA ALL HOWEVER TENDING TO DISINTEGRATE INTO HOMOGENEOUS LOOKING MUDS OR DUSTS
3240-131232-0007 RED OR BLACK OR YELLOW TREASURE TROVES FOR THE PALAEONTOLOGISTS AND FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ACCUMULATIONS OF CENTURIES CYCLONES OF EGYPT GREECE AND ASSYRIA FISHES DRIED AND HARD THERE A SHORT TIME OTHERS THERE LONG ENOUGH TO PUTREFY
3240-131232-0008 BUT THE OMNIPRESENCE OF HETEROGENEITY OR LIVING FISHES ALSO PONDS OF FRESH WATER OCEANS OF SALT WATER AS TO THE LAW OF GRAVITATION I PREFER TO TAKE ONE SIMPLE STAND
3240-131232-0009 ORTHODOXY ACCEPTS THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES GRAVITATION IS ONE OF THESE FORCES ALL OTHER FORCES HAVE PHENOMENA OF REPULSION AND OF INERTNESS IRRESPECTIVE OF DISTANCE AS WELL AS OF ATTRACTION
3240-131232-0010 BUT NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION ADMITS ATTRACTION ONLY THEN NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION CAN BE ONLY ONE THIRD ACCEPTABLE EVEN TO THE ORTHODOX OR THERE IS DENIAL OF THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES OR STILL SIMPLER HERE ARE THE DATA
3240-131232-0011 THOUGH IT HARMONIZES WITH DATA OF FISHES THAT FALL AS IF FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND OF COURSE WITH OTHER DATA TOO IS INADEQUATE TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO PECULIARITIES OF THE FALLS OF FROGS THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF TADPOLES BEEN REPORTED
3240-131232-0012 THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF FULL GROWN FROGS BEEN REPORTED ALWAYS FROGS A FEW MONTHS OLD IT SOUNDS POSITIVE BUT IF THERE BE SUCH REPORTS THEY ARE SOMEWHERE OUT OF MY RANGE OF READING BUT TADPOLES WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SKY THAN WOULD FROGS
3240-131232-0013 LITTLE OR BIG IF SUCH FALLS BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHIRLWINDS AND MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA IF THOUGH VERY TENTATIVELY AND PROVISIONALLY WE ACCEPT THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA
3240-131232-0014 BEFORE WE TAKE UP AN ESPECIAL EXPRESSION UPON THE FALL OF IMMATURE AND LARVAL FORMS OF LIFE TO THIS EARTH AND THE NECESSITY THEN OF CONCEIVING OF SOME FACTOR BESIDES MERE STATIONARINESS OR SUSPENSION OR STAGNATION
3240-131232-0015 THERE ARE OTHER DATA THAT ARE SIMILAR TO DATA OF FALLS OF FISHES SCIENCE GOSSIP
3240-131232-0016 THAT SMALL SNAILS OF A LAND SPECIES HAD FALLEN NEAR REDRUTH CORNWALL JULY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX DURING A HEAVY THUNDERSTORM ROADS AND FIELDS STREWN WITH THEM SO THAT THEY WERE GATHERED UP BY THE HATFUL
3240-131232-0017 NONE SEEN TO FALL BY THE WRITER OF THIS ACCOUNT SNAILS SAID TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT TO ANY PREVIOUSLY KNOWN IN THIS DISTRICT
3240-131232-0018 OF GREAT AND DESERVED REPUTE I THOUGHT I SHOULD FOR ONCE LIKE TO TRACE THE ORIGIN OF ONE OF THESE FABULOUS TALES OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE IS THAT JUSTICE CANNOT BE IN AN INTERMEDIATE EXISTENCE
3240-131232-0019 IN WHICH THERE CAN BE APPROXIMATION ONLY TO JUSTICE OR TO INJUSTICE THAT TO BE FAIR IS TO HAVE NO OPINION AT ALL THAT TO BE HONEST IS TO BE UNINTERESTED THAT TO INVESTIGATE IS TO ADMIT PREJUDICE THAT NOBODY HAS EVER REALLY INVESTIGATED ANYTHING
3240-131232-0020 BUT HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT POSITIVELY TO PROVE OR TO DISPROVE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONCEIVED OF OR SUSPECTED IN ADVANCE AS I SUSPECTED SAYS THIS CORRESPONDENT I FOUND THAT THE SNAILS WERE OF A FAMILIAR LAND SPECIES THAT THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND
3240-131232-0021 IN THE FIRST PLACE HE FOUND THAT THE SNAILS HAD APPEARED AFTER THE RAIN THAT ASTONISHED RUSTICS HAD JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY HAD FALLEN HE MET ONE PERSON WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN THE SNAILS FALL THIS WAS HIS ERROR SAYS THE INVESTIGATOR
3240-131232-0022 IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT THEY WERE SHOVELED UP IT IS SAID THAT THE SNAILS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A LOCAL SPECIES
3240-131232-0023 AND THAT IN HIS OPINION THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME UNUSUAL CONDITION ALOFT COMES OUT IN HIS OBSERVATION UPON THE CURIOUS AZURE BLUE APPEARANCE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME
3240-131232-0024 THAT ACCORDING TO DAS WETTER DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO UPON AUGUST NINTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A YELLOW CLOUD APPEARED OVER PADERBORN GERMANY FROM THIS CLOUD FELL A TORRENTIAL RAIN IN WHICH WERE HUNDREDS OF MUSSELS
3240-131232-0025 THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE NOR OF A WHIRLWIND LIZARDS
3240-131232-0026 THAT DURING A HEAVY SHOWER JULY THIRD EIGHTEEN SIXTY HE HEARD A PECULIAR SOUND AT HIS FEET AND LOOKING DOWN SAW A SNAKE LYING AS IF STUNNED BY A FALL IT THEN CAME TO LIFE GRAY SNAKE ABOUT A FOOT LONG
3240-131232-0027 THESE DATA HAVE ANY MEANING OR LACK OF MEANING OR DEGREE OF DAMNATION YOU PLEASE BUT IN THE MATTER OF THE FALL THAT OCCURRED AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE OCCUR SOME STRONG SIGNIFICANCES
3240-131232-0028 OUR QUASI REASONING UPON THIS SUBJECT APPLIES TO ALL SEGREGATIONS SO FAR CONSIDERED MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT
3240-131232-0029 RATHER STRICTLY LOCALIZED OR IN A SPACE OF TWO BLOCKS AND AFTER A VIOLENT STORM IN WHICH THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS SNAKES WERE FOUND THEY WERE CRAWLING ON SIDEWALKS IN YARDS AND IN STREETS AND IN MASSES
3240-131232-0030 BUT NONE WERE FOUND ON ROOFS OR ANY OTHER ELEVATION ABOVE GROUND AND NONE WERE SEEN TO FALL IF YOU PREFER TO BELIEVE THAT THE SNAKES HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE OR HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THAT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO CALL SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEM
3240-131232-0031 IN THE STREETS OF MEMPHIS JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHY THAT'S SENSIBLE THAT'S THE COMMON SENSE THAT HAS BEEN AGAINST US FROM THE FIRST IT IS NOT SAID WHETHER THE SNAKES WERE OF A KNOWN SPECIES OR NOT
3240-131232-0032 AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE STREETS CRAWLING LOOSE OR IN THICK TANGLED MASSES IN THE FIRST PLACE IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT THESE SNAKES HAD BEEN RAISED FROM SOME OTHER PART OF THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN A WHIRLWIND IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT A WHIRLWIND COULD SEGREGATE THEM
3240-131232-0033 STONES FENCE RAILS LIMBS OF TREES SAY THAT THE SNAKES OCCUPIED THE NEXT GRADATION AND WOULD BE THE NEXT TO FALL
3240-131232-0034 AGAIN OURS IS THE OBJECTION AGAINST SUCH SELECTIVENESS BY A WHIRLWIND CONCEIVABLY A WHIRLWIND COULD SCOOP OUT A DEN OF HIBERNATING SNAKES WITH STONES AND EARTH AND AN INFINITUDE OF OTHER DEBRIS SNATCHING UP DOZENS OF SNAKES
3240-131232-0035 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TO A DEN HUNDREDS MAYBE BUT ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THIS OCCURRENCE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM ALIVE FROM ONE FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN LENGTH
3240-131232-0036 RECORDS THE FALL AND SAYS THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM THE USUAL WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION IS GIVEN BUT IN WHAT LOCALITY SNAKES EXIST IN SUCH ABUNDANCE IS YET A MYSTERY THIS MATTER OF ENORMOUSNESS OF NUMBERS
3240-131232-0037 SUGGESTS TO ME SOMETHING OF A MIGRATORY NATURE BUT THAT SNAKES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT MIGRATE IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IF EVER AS TO FALLS OR FLUTTERINGS OF WINGED INSECTS FROM THE SKY PREVAILING NOTIONS OF SWARMING WOULD SEEM EXPLANATORY ENOUGH
3240-131232-0038 FALL OF FISHES JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN HOLLAND ANTS AUGUST FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE STRASBOURG LITTLE TOADS AUGUST SECOND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE SAVOY
3240-131232-0039 FALL OF ANTS CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR SOME WERE WINGLESS
3240-131232-0040 ENORMOUS FALL OF ANTS NANCY FRANCE JULY TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MOST OF THEM WERE WINGLESS
328-129766-0000 AND SO MIGHT MARRY AGAIN WHEN HE WOULD
328-129766-0001 AND TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT ME AS LONG AS I LIVED AND THAT IF HE DIED BEFORE ME HE WOULD LEAVE SUFFICIENT TO HIS MOTHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME STILL IN THE NAME OF A SISTER AND HE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS CAREFUL OF ME WHEN HE HEARD OF ME
328-129766-0002 AS YOU SHALL HEAR IN ITS TIME I CAME AWAY FOR ENGLAND IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST AFTER I HAD BEEN EIGHT YEARS IN THAT COUNTRY AND NOW A NEW SCENE OF MISFORTUNES ATTENDED ME WHICH PERHAPS FEW WOMEN HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LIFE OF
328-129766-0003 WE HAD AN INDIFFERENT GOOD VOYAGE TILL WE CAME JUST UPON THE COAST OF ENGLAND AND WHERE WE ARRIVED IN TWO AND THIRTY DAYS BUT WERE THEN RUFFLED WITH TWO OR THREE STORMS
328-129766-0004 GOT SOME REFRESHMENT ON SHORE AND PUT TO SEA AGAIN THOUGH WE MET WITH VERY BAD WEATHER AGAIN IN WHICH THE SHIP SPRUNG HER MAINMAST AS THEY CALLED IT FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT THEY MEANT BUT WE GOT AT LAST INTO MILFORD HAVEN IN WALES
328-129766-0005 WHERE THOUGH IT WAS REMOTE FROM OUR PORT
328-129766-0006 THE ISLE OF BRITAIN I RESOLVED TO VENTURE IT NO MORE UPON THE WATERS WHICH HAD BEEN SO TERRIBLE TO ME SO GETTING MY CLOTHES AND MONEY ON SHORE WITH MY BILLS OF LOADING AND OTHER PAPERS I RESOLVED TO COME FOR LONDON
328-129766-0007 THE PORT WHITHER SHE WAS BOUND WAS TO BRISTOL WHERE MY BROTHER'S CHIEF CORRESPONDENT LIVED I GOT TO LONDON IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS WHERE I HEARD A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THAT THE SHIP WAS ARRIVED IN BRISTOL
328-129766-0008 THE BREAKING OF HER MAINMAST SHE HAD GREAT DAMAGE ON BOARD AND THAT A GREAT PART OF HER CARGO WAS SPOILED I HAD NOW A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UPON MY HANDS AND A DREADFUL APPEARANCE IT HAD I WAS COME AWAY WITH A KIND OF FINAL FAREWELL
328-129766-0009 WHAT I BROUGHT WITH ME WAS INDEED CONSIDERABLE HAD IT COME SAFE AND BY THE HELP OF IT I MIGHT HAVE MARRIED AGAIN TOLERABLY WELL BUT AS IT WAS I WAS REDUCED TO BETWEEN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN THE WHOLE AND THIS WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF RECRUIT
328-129766-0010 I WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT FRIENDS NAY EVEN SO MUCH AS WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCE
328-129766-0011 THAT SET ME UP FORMERLY FOR A FORTUNE SHE WAS DEAD AND HER HUSBAND ALSO AS I WAS INFORMED UPON SENDING A PERSON UNKNOWN TO INQUIRE THE LOOKING AFTER MY CARGO OF GOODS SOON AFTER OBLIGED ME TO TAKE A JOURNEY TO BRISTOL AND DURING MY ATTENDANCE UPON THAT AFFAIR
328-129766-0012 I TOOK THE DIVERSION OF GOING TO THE BATH FOR AS I WAS STILL FAR FROM BEING OLD SO MY HUMOUR WHICH WAS ALWAYS GAY CONTINUED SO TO AN EXTREME AND BEING NOW AS IT WERE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE THOUGH I WAS A WOMAN WITHOUT A FORTUNE
328-129766-0013 AS HAD BEEN MY CASE BEFORE THE BATH IS A PLACE OF GALLANTRY ENOUGH EXPENSIVE AND FULL OF SNARES I WENT THITHER INDEED
328-129766-0014 BUT I MUST DO MYSELF JUSTICE AS TO PROTEST I KNEW NOTHING AMISS I MEANT NOTHING BUT IN AN HONEST WAY NOR HAD I ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT ME AT FIRST THAT LOOKED THE WAY WHICH AFTERWARDS I SUFFERED THEM TO BE GUIDED
328-129766-0015 AS IT IS CALLED THERE AND CONTRACTED SOME UNHAPPY ACQUAINTANCES WHICH RATHER PROMPTED THE FOLLIES I FELL AFTERWARDS INTO THAN FORTIFIED ME AGAINST THEM I LIVED PLEASANTLY ENOUGH KEPT GOOD COMPANY THAT IS TO SAY GAY FINE COMPANY
328-129766-0016 BUT HAD THE DISCOURAGEMENT TO FIND THIS WAY OF LIVING SUNK ME EXCEEDINGLY AND THAT AS I HAD NO SETTLED INCOME SO SPENDING UPON THE MAIN STOCK WAS BUT A CERTAIN KIND OF BLEEDING TO DEATH AND THIS GAVE ME MANY SAD REFLECTIONS IN THE INTERVAL OF MY OTHER THOUGHTS
328-129766-0017 HOWEVER I SHOOK THEM OFF
328-129766-0018 BUT I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR IT I WAS NOT NOW AT REDRIFF WHERE IF I HAD SET MYSELF TOLERABLY UP SOME HONEST SEA CAPTAIN OR OTHER MIGHT HAVE TALKED WITH ME UPON THE HONOURABLE TERMS OF MATRIMONY BUT I WAS AT THE BATH
328-129766-0019 WHERE MEN FIND A MISTRESS SOMETIMES BUT VERY RARELY LOOK FOR A WIFE AND CONSEQUENTLY ALL THE PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCES A WOMAN CAN EXPECT TO MAKE THERE MUST HAVE SOME TENDENCY THAT WAY I HAD SPENT THE FIRST SEASON WELL ENOUGH
328-129766-0020 FOR THOUGH I HAD CONTRACTED SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO CAME TO THE BATH FOR HIS DIVERSION
328-129766-0021 AS IT MIGHT BE CALLED I HAD RESISTED SOME CASUAL OFFERS OF GALLANTRY AND HAD MANAGED THAT WAY WELL ENOUGH I WAS NOT WICKED ENOUGH TO COME INTO THE CRIME FOR THE MERE VICE OF IT AND I HAD NO EXTRAORDINARY OFFERS MADE ME THAT TEMPTED ME WITH THE MAIN THING WHICH I WANTED
328-129766-0022 I CONTRACTED AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED WHO THOUGH SHE DID NOT KEEP AN ILL HOUSE AS WE CALL IT YET HAD NONE OF THE BEST PRINCIPLES IN HERSELF I HAD ON ALL OCCASIONS BEHAVED MYSELF SO WELL
328-129766-0023 AS NOT TO GET THE LEAST SLUR UPON MY REPUTATION ON ANY ACCOUNT WHATEVER AND ALL THE MEN THAT I HAD CONVERSED WITH WERE OF SO GOOD REPUTATION THAT I HAD NOT GIVEN THE LEAST REFLECTION BY CONVERSING WITH THEM
328-129766-0024 FOR A WICKED CORRESPONDENCE IF THEY HAD ANY OF THEM OFFERED IT YET THERE WAS ONE GENTLEMAN AS ABOVE WHO ALWAYS SINGLED ME OUT FOR THE DIVERSION OF MY COMPANY AS HE CALLED IT WHICH AS HE WAS PLEASED TO SAY WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HIM BUT AT THAT TIME
328-129766-0025 THERE WAS NO MORE IN IT I HAD MANY MELANCHOLY HOURS AT THE BATH AFTER THE COMPANY WAS GONE
328-129766-0026 AND FOR RECRUITS OF MONEY YET I CHOSE TO COME BACK TO BATH FOR MY RESIDENCE BECAUSE BEING ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED IN THE SUMMER I FOUND THAT DURING THE WINTER I LIVED RATHER CHEAPER THERE
328-129766-0027 HERE I SAY I PASSED THE WINTER AS HEAVILY AS I HAD PASSED THE AUTUMN CHEERFULLY
328-129766-0028 OF WHAT LAY HARDEST UPON MY MIND AND PARTICULARLY THE NARROWNESS OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE LOSS OF MY FORTUNE BY THE DAMAGE OF MY GOODS AT SEA I TOLD HER ALSO THAT I HAD A MOTHER AND A BROTHER IN VIRGINIA IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0029 AND AS I HAD REALLY WRITTEN BACK TO MY MOTHER IN PARTICULAR TO REPRESENT MY CONDITION AND THE GREAT LOSS I HAD RECEIVED
328-129766-0030 SO I DID NOT FAIL TO LET MY NEW FRIEND KNOW THAT I EXPECTED A SUPPLY FROM THENCE AND SO INDEED I DID AND AS THE SHIPS WENT FROM BRISTOL TO YORK RIVER IN VIRGINIA AND BACK AGAIN GENERALLY IN LESS TIME FROM LONDON
328-129766-0031 AND THAT MY BROTHER CORRESPONDED CHIEFLY AT BRISTOL I THOUGHT IT WAS MUCH BETTER FOR ME TO WAIT HERE FOR MY RETURNS THAN TO GO TO LONDON WHERE ALSO I HAD NOT THE LEAST ACQUAINTANCE MY NEW FRIEND APPEARED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH MY CONDITION
328-129766-0032 AND INDEED WAS SO VERY KIND AS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF MY LIVING WITH HER TO SO LOW A PRICE DURING THE WINTER THAT SHE CONVINCED ME SHE GOT NOTHING BY ME AND AS FOR LODGING DURING THE WINTER I PAID NOTHING AT ALL
328-129766-0033 TILL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO DO OTHERWISE SHE HAD SOME PERSONS OF CHARACTER THAT FREQUENTLY LODGED IN HER HOUSE AND IN PARTICULAR THE GENTLEMAN WHO AS I SAID SINGLED ME OUT FOR HIS COMPANION
328-129766-0034 THE WINTER BEFORE AND HE CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN HIS COMPANY AND TWO SERVANTS AND LODGED IN THE SAME HOUSE
328-129766-0035 LETTING HIM KNOW THAT I WAS STILL WITH HER BUT SHE DENIED IT AND PROTESTED TO ME THAT SHE DID NOT AND HE SAID THE SAME IN A WORD THIS GENTLEMAN CAME DOWN AND CONTINUED TO SINGLE ME OUT FOR HIS PECULIAR CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS CONVERSATION
328-129766-0036 IF I MIGHT BELIEVE HIM WAS TO HIM
328-129766-0037 AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
328-129766-0038 AND THAT I WAITED AT BATH TILL THE NEXT VIRGINIA FLEET SHOULD ARRIVE BY WHICH I EXPECTED CONSIDERABLE EFFECTS I UNDERSTOOD BY HIM AND BY OTHERS OF HIM THAT HE HAD A WIFE BUT THAT THE LADY WAS DISTEMPERED IN HER HEAD AND WAS UNDER THE CONDUCT
328-129766-0039 OF HER OWN RELATIONS WHICH HE CONSENTED TO TO AVOID ANY REFLECTIONS THAT MIGHT AS WAS NOT UNUSUAL IN SUCH CASES BE CAST ON HIM FOR MISMANAGING HER CURE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE CAME TO THE BATH TO DIVERT HIS THOUGHTS
328-129766-0040 FROM THE DISTURBANCE OF SUCH A MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE AS THAT WAS MY LANDLADY WHO OF HER OWN ACCORD ENCOURAGED THE CORRESPONDENCE ON ALL OCCASIONS GAVE ME AN ADVANTAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HIM
328-129766-0041 AS A MAN OF HONOUR AND OF VIRTUE AS WELL AS OF GREAT ESTATE AND INDEED I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF REASON TO SAY SO OF HIM TOO FOR THOUGH WE LODGED BOTH ON A FLOOR AND HE HAD FREQUENTLY COME INTO MY CHAMBER EVEN WHEN I WAS IN BED
328-129766-0042 AND I ALSO INTO HIS WHEN HE WAS IN BED YET HE NEVER OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME FURTHER THAN A KISS OR SO MUCH AS SOLICITED ME TO ANYTHING TILL LONG AFTER AS YOU SHALL HEAR
328-129766-0043 AND SHE AGAIN USED TO TELL ME SHE BELIEVED IT WAS SO FROM THE BEGINNING HOWEVER SHE USED TO TELL ME THAT SHE THOUGHT I OUGHT TO EXPECT SOME GRATIFICATION FROM HIM FOR MY COMPANY FOR INDEED HE DID AS IT WERE ENGROSS ME AND I WAS SELDOM FROM HIM
328-129766-0044 I TOLD HER I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM THE LEAST OCCASION TO THINK I WANTED IT
328-129766-0045 AND SHE DID SO AND MANAGED IT SO DEXTEROUSLY
328-129766-0046 AND SO I PUT OFF ALL ROOM FOR ANY OFFER FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ATTACKED ME AGAIN
328-129766-0047 WHICH HE WAS SORRY FOR ASSURING ME THAT HE INQUIRED INTO IT WITH NO DESIGN TO SATISFY HIS OWN CURIOSITY BUT MERELY TO ASSIST ME IF THERE WAS ANY OCCASION BUT SINCE I
328-129766-0048 IN NEED OF ANY ASSISTANCE HE HAD BUT ONE THING MORE TO DESIRE OF ME AND THAT WAS THAT I WOULD PROMISE HIM THAT WHEN I WAS ANY WAY STRAITENED OR LIKE TO BE SO I WOULD FRANKLY TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I WOULD MAKE USE OF HIM WITH THE SAME FREEDOM THAT HE MADE THE OFFER
328-129766-0049 ADDING THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS FIND I HAD A TRUE FRIEND THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS AFRAID TO TRUST HIM I OMITTED NOTHING THAT WAS FIT TO BE SAID BY ONE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I HAD A DUE SENSE OF HIS KINDNESS
328-129766-0050 AND INDEED FROM THAT TIME I DID NOT APPEAR SO MUCH RESERVED TO HIM AS I HAD DONE BEFORE THOUGH STILL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE STRICTEST VIRTUE ON BOTH SIDES BUT HOW FREE SOEVER OUR CONVERSATION WAS I COULD NOT ARRIVE TO THAT SORT OF FREEDOM
328-129766-0051 THOUGH I WAS SECRETLY VERY GLAD OF HIS OFFER SOME WEEKS PASSED AFTER THIS AND STILL I NEVER ASKED HIM FOR MONEY WHEN MY LANDLADY A CUNNING CREATURE WHO HAD OFTEN PRESSED ME TO IT BUT FOUND THAT I COULD NOT DO IT
328-129766-0052 MAKES A STORY OF HER OWN INVENTING AND COMES IN
328-129766-0053 OH WIDOW SAYS SHE I HAVE BAD NEWS TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING WHAT IS THAT SAID I ARE THE VIRGINIA SHIPS TAKEN BY THE FRENCH FOR THAT WAS MY FEAR NO NO SAYS SHE
328-129766-0054 BUT THE MAN YOU SENT TO BRISTOL YESTERDAY FOR MONEY IS COME BACK AND SAYS HE HAS BROUGHT NONE NOW I COULD BY NO MEANS LIKE HER PROJECT
328-129766-0055 WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT WANT AND I CLEARLY SAW THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY BEING BACKWARD TO ASK SO I TOOK HER UP SHORT
328-129766-0056 SAID I FOR I ASSURE YOU HE BROUGHT ME ALL THE MONEY I SENT HIM FOR AND HERE IT IS SAID I PULLING OUT MY PURSE WITH ABOUT TWELVE GUINEAS IN IT AND ADDED I INTEND YOU SHALL HAVE MOST OF IT BY AND BY HE SEEMED DISTASTED A LITTLE AT HER TALKING
328-129766-0057 AS SHE DID AT FIRST AS WELL AS I TAKING IT AS I FANCIED HE WOULD AS SOMETHING FORWARD OF HER BUT WHEN HE SAW ME GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER HE CAME IMMEDIATELY TO HIMSELF AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING WE TALKED OF IT AGAIN WHEN I FOUND HE WAS FULLY SATISFIED
328-129766-0058 AND SMILING SAID HE HOPED I WOULD NOT WANT MONEY AND NOT TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I HAD PROMISED HIM OTHERWISE I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED AT MY LANDLADY'S TALKING SO PUBLICLY THE DAY BEFORE OF WHAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
328-129766-0059 BUT I SUPPOSED SHE WANTED WHAT I OWED HER WHICH WAS ABOUT EIGHT GUINEAS WHICH I HAD RESOLVED TO GIVE HER AND HAD ACCORDINGLY
328-129766-0060 HE WAS IN A MIGHT GOOD HUMOUR WHEN HE HEARD ME SAY I HAD PAID HER AND IT WENT OFF INTO SOME OTHER DISCOURSE AT THAT TIME BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE HAVING HEARD ME UP ABOUT MY ROOM BEFORE HIM HE CALLED TO ME AND I ANSWERING HE ASKED ME TO COME INTO HIS CHAMBER
328-129766-0061 FOR HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME WHICH WAS OF SOME MOMENT AFTER SOME VERY KIND EXPRESSIONS HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE VERY HONEST TO HIM AND GIVE A SINCERE ANSWER TO ONE THING HE WOULD DESIRE OF ME
328-129766-0062 AT THE WORD SINCERE AND ASKING HIM IF I HAD EVER GIVEN HIM ANY ANSWERS WHICH WERE NOT SINCERE I PROMISED HIM I WOULD WHY THEN HIS REQUEST WAS HE SAID TO LET HIM SEE MY PURSE
328-129766-0063 I IMMEDIATELY PUT MY HAND INTO MY POCKET AND LAUGHING TO HIM PULLED IT OUT AND THERE WAS IN IT THREE GUINEAS AND A HALF
328-129766-0064 NOT BY A GREAT DEAL WELL THEN HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE ME PROMISE TO GO AND FETCH HIM ALL THE MONEY I HAD EVERY FARTHING I TOLD HIM I WOULD AND I WENT INTO MY CHAMBER AND FETCHED HIM A LITTLE PRIVATE DRAWER
328-129766-0065 WHERE I HAD ABOUT SIX GUINEAS MORE AND SOME SILVER AND THREW IT ALL DOWN UPON THE BED AND TOLD HIM THERE WAS ALL MY WEALTH HONESTLY TO A SHILLING HE LOOKED A LITTLE AT IT BUT DID NOT TELL IT
328-129766-0066 AND THEN REACHING HIS POCKET PULLED OUT A KEY AND BADE ME OPEN A LITTLE WALNUT TREE BOX HE HAD UPON THE TABLE AND BRING HIM SUCH A DRAWER WHICH I DID IN WHICH DRAWER THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN GOLD I BELIEVE NEAR TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
328-129766-0067 BUT I KNEW NOT HOW MUCH HE TOOK THE DRAWER AND TAKING MY HAND MADE ME PUT IT IN AND TAKE A WHOLE HANDFUL I WAS BACKWARD AT THAT BUT HE HELD MY HAND HARD IN HIS HAND
328-129766-0068 WHEN I HAD DONE SO HE MADE ME PUT THEM INTO MY LAP AND TOOK MY LITTLE DRAWER
328-129766-0069 AND CARRY IT ALL HOME INTO MY OWN CHAMBER I RELATE THIS STORY THE MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE GOOD HUMOUR THERE WAS IN IT AND TO SHOW THE TEMPER WITH WHICH WE CONVERSED
328-129766-0070 AND IN A WORD PRESSED ME TO BUY BETTER
328-129766-0071 FOR I LOVED NOTHING IN THE WORLD BETTER THAN FINE CLOTHES I TOLD HIM I MUST HOUSEWIFE THE MONEY HE HAD LENT ME OR ELSE I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY HIM AGAIN HE THEN TOLD ME IN A FEW WORDS THAT AS HE HAD A SINCERE RESPECT FOR ME AND KNEW MY CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0072 AND THAT HE THOUGHT I HAD MERITED IT FROM HIM BY GIVING HIM MY COMPANY SO ENTIRELY AS I HAD DONE AFTER THIS HE MADE ME TAKE A MAID AND KEEP HOUSE
328-129766-0073 WHICH I DID VERY WILLINGLY BELIEVING AS IT APPEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY IT NOR DID THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE FAIL TO FIND HER ACCOUNT IN IT TOO WE HAD LIVED THUS NEAR THREE MONTHS WHEN
328-129766-0074 THE COMPANY BEGINNING TO WEAR AWAY AT THE BATH HE TALKED OF GOING AWAY
328-129766-0075 I WAS NOT VERY EASY IN THAT PROPOSAL NOT KNOWING WHAT POSTURE I WAS TO LIVE IN THERE OR HOW HE MIGHT USE ME BUT WHILE THIS WAS IN DEBATE
328-129766-0076 CALLED SHEPTON WHERE HE HAD SOME BUSINESS AND WAS THERE TAKEN VERY ILL AND SO ILL THAT HE COULD NOT TRAVEL SO HE SENT HIS MAN BACK TO BATH TO BEG ME THAT I WOULD HIRE A COACH AND COME OVER TO HIM BEFORE HE WENT
328-129766-0077 HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS MONEY AND OTHER THINGS OF VALUE WITH ME AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM I DID NOT KNOW BUT I SECURED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD AND LOCKED UP THE LODGINGS AND WENT TO HIM WHERE I FOUND HIM VERY ILL INDEED HOWEVER I PERSUADED HIM TO BE CARRIED
328-129766-0078 IN A LITTER TO THE BATH WHERE THERE WAS MORE HELP AND BETTER ADVICE TO BE HAD HE CONSENTED AND I BROUGHT HIM TO THE BATH WHICH WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES AS I REMEMBER HERE HE CONTINUED VERY ILL OF A FEVER
328-129766-0079 AND KEPT HIS BED FIVE WEEKS ALL WHICH TIME I NURSED HIM AND TENDED HIM MYSELF
328-129766-0080 INDEED IF I HAD BEEN HIS WIFE I COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE I SAT UP WITH HIM SO MUCH AND SO OFTEN THAT AT LAST INDEED HE WOULD NOT LET ME SIT UP ANY LONGER AND THEN I GOT A PALLET BED INTO HIS ROOM AND LAY IN IT JUST AT HIS BED'S FEET
328-129766-0081 I WAS INDEED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH HIS CONDITION AND WITH THE APPREHENSION OF LOSING SUCH A FRIEND AS HE WAS AND WAS LIKE TO BE TO ME AND I USED TO SIT AND CRY BY HIM MANY HOURS TOGETHER
328-129766-0082 HOWEVER AT LAST HE GREW BETTER AND GAVE HOPES THAT HE WOULD RECOVER AS INDEED HE DID THOUGH VERY SLOWLY WERE IT OTHERWISE THAN WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY I SHOULD NOT BE BACKWARD TO DISCLOSE IT
328-129766-0083 AS IT IS APPARENT I HAVE DONE IN OTHER CASES IN THIS ACCOUNT BUT I AFFIRM THAT THROUGH ALL THIS CONVERSATION ABATING THE FREEDOM OF COMING INTO THE CHAMBER WHEN I OR HE WAS IN BED AND ABATING THE NECESSARY OFFICES
328-129766-0084 OF ATTENDING HIM NIGHT AND DAY WHEN HE WAS SICK THERE HAD NOT PASSED THE LEAST IMMODEST WORD OR ACTION BETWEEN US OH THAT IT HAD BEEN SO TO THE LAST AFTER SOME TIME HE GATHERED STRENGTH AND GREW WELL APACE
328-129766-0085 AND I WOULD HAVE REMOVED MY PALLET BED BUT HE WOULD NOT LET ME TILL HE WAS ABLE TO VENTURE HIMSELF WITHOUT ANYBODY TO SIT UP WITH HIM AND THEN I REMOVED TO MY OWN CHAMBER
328-129766-0086 AND WHEN HE GREW QUITE WELL HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF FIFTY GUINEAS FOR MY CARE AND AS HE CALLED IT FOR HAZARDING MY LIFE TO SAVE HIS AND NOW HE MADE DEEP PROTESTATIONS OF A SINCERE INVIOLABLE AFFECTION FOR ME
328-129766-0087 BUT ALL ALONG ATTESTED IT TO BE WITH THE UTMOST RESERVE FOR MY VIRTUE AND HIS OWN I TOLD HIM I WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF IT HE CARRIED IT THAT LENGTH THAT HE PROTESTED TO ME THAT IF HE WAS NAKED IN BED WITH ME
328-129766-0088 AS HE WOULD DEFEND IT IF I WAS ASSAULTED BY A RAVISHER I BELIEVED HIM AND TOLD HIM I DID SO BUT THIS DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WOULD HE SAID
328-129766-0089 WAS A GREAT WHILE AFTER THIS THAT I HAD OCCASION ON MY OWN BUSINESS TO GO TO BRISTOL UPON WHICH HE HIRED ME A COACH AND WOULD GO WITH ME AND DID SO AND NOW INDEED OUR INTIMACY INCREASED
328-129766-0090 TO HAVE NO LODGING IN THE INN BUT IN ONE LARGE CHAMBER WITH TWO BEDS IN IT
328-129766-0091 AND COMING INTO THAT ROOM SAID VERY FRANKLY TO HIM SIR IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE LADY BE YOUR SPOUSE OR NO
328-129766-0092 WHICH DREW QUITE ACROSS THE ROOM AND EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED THE BEDS WELL SAYS MY FRIEND VERY READILY THESE BEDS WILL DO AND AS FOR THE REST WE ARE TOO NEAR AKIN TO LIE TOGETHER THOUGH WE MAY LODGE NEAR ONE ANOTHER
328-129766-0093 HE DECENTLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TILL I WAS IN BED AND THEN WENT TO BED IN THE BED ON HIS OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT LAY THERE TALKING TO ME A GREAT WHILE AT LAST REPEATING HIS USUAL SAYING THAT HE COULD LIE NAKED IN THE BED WITH ME AND NOT OFFER ME THE LEAST INJURY
328-129766-0094 HE STARTS OUT OF HIS BED AND NOW MY DEAR SAYS HE YOU SHALL SEE HOW JUST I WILL BE TO YOU AND THAT I CAN KEEP MY WORD AND AWAY HE COMES TO MY BED I RESISTED A LITTLE BUT I MUST CONFESS I SHOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED HIM MUCH
328-129766-0095 IF HE HAD NOT MADE THOSE PROMISES AT ALL SO AFTER A LITTLE STRUGGLE AS I SAID I LAY STILL AND LET HIM COME TO BED WHEN HE WAS THERE HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND SO I LAY ALL NIGHT WITH HIM BUT HE HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH ME OR OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME
328-129766-0096 OTHER THAN EMBRACING ME AS I SAY IN HIS ARMS NO NOT THE WHOLE NIGHT BUT ROSE UP AND DRESSED HIM IN THE MORNING AND LEFT ME AS INNOCENT FOR HIM AS I WAS THE DAY I WAS BORN THIS WAS A SURPRISING THING TO ME
328-129766-0097 AND PERHAPS MAY BE SO TO OTHERS WHO KNOW HOW THE LAWS OF NATURE WORK FOR HE WAS A STRONG VIGOROUS BRISK PERSON NOR DID HE ACT THUS ON A PRINCIPLE OF RELIGION AT ALL BUT OF MERE AFFECTION INSISTING ON IT
328-129766-0098 THAT THOUGH I WAS TO HIM TO MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN IN THE WORLD YET BECAUSE HE LOVED ME HE COULD NOT INJURE ME
332-128985-0000 WE WILL PASS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REGULAR OUT AND OUT PIRATE ONE FROM WHOSE MAST HEAD WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE BLACK FLAG WITH ITS SKULL AND CROSS BONES IF THAT EMBLEMATIC PIECE OF BUNTING HAD BEEN IN USE BY THE PIRATES OF THE PERIOD
332-128985-0001 AND HIS OWN WAS UNKNOWN AND THE BRAZILIAN BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN BRAZIL THOUGH OF DUTCH PARENTS UNLIKE MOST OF HIS FELLOW PRACTITIONERS HE DID NOT GRADUALLY BECOME A PIRATE FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH
332-128985-0002 HE NEVER HAD AN INTENTION OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE AS SOON AS HE GREW TO BE A MAN HE BECAME A BLOODY BUCCANEER AND AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY HE JOINED A PIRATE CREW AND HAD MADE BUT A FEW VOYAGES WHEN IT WAS PERCEIVED BY HIS COMPANIONS
332-128985-0003 THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGES
332-128985-0004 HE FELL IN WITH A SPANISH SHIP LOADED WITH SILVER BULLION HAVING CAPTURED THIS HE SAILED WITH HIS PRIZE TO JAMAICA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GREAT RESORTS OF THE ENGLISH BUCCANEERS THERE HIS SUCCESS DELIGHTED THE COMMUNITY
332-128985-0005 HIS TALENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF GREAT PIRATICAL OPERATIONS SOON BECAME APPARENT AND HE WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE HEAD PIRATE OF THE WEST INDIES HE WAS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A HERO EVEN BY THOSE COLONISTS
332-128985-0006 WHO HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH PIRATES AND AS FOR ESQUEMELING HE SIMPLY WORSHIPPED THE GREAT BRAZILIAN DESPERADO IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT JULIUS CAESAR OR MISTER GLADSTONE
332-128985-0007 HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC IN HIS PRAISES AND AS IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS THE ROC IS DESCRIBED AS THE GREATEST OF BIRDS SO IN THE EYES OF THE BUCCANEER BIOGRAPHER THIS ROC WAS THE GREATEST OF PIRATES
332-128985-0008 THAT ROC NOW BECAME FAMOUS THE BETTER HE BECAME KNOWN THE MORE GENERAL WAS THE FEAR AND RESPECT FELT FOR HIM AND WE ARE TOLD THAT THE MOTHERS OF THE ISLANDS USED TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO SLEEP BY THREATENING THEM WITH THE TERRIBLE ROC IF THEY DID NOT CLOSE THEIR EYES
332-128985-0009 THIS STORY HOWEVER I REGARD WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DOUBT
332-128985-0010 BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS AN EASY THING TO FRIGHTEN A CHILD INTO GOING TO SLEEP IF I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A YOUNGSTER TAKE A NAP I SHOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN CUBA OR OF THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE ARMENIANS
332-128985-0011 THIS RENOWNED PIRATE FROM BRAZIL MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE FELLOW TO LOOK AT HE WAS STRONG AND BRAWNY HIS FACE WAS SHORT AND VERY WIDE WITH HIGH CHEEK BONES AND HIS EXPRESSION PROBABLY RESEMBLED THAT OF A PUG DOG
332-128985-0012 HIS EYEBROWS WERE ENORMOUSLY LARGE AND BUSHY AND FROM UNDER THEM HE GLARED AT HIS MUNDANE SURROUNDINGS HE WAS NOT A MAN WHOSE SPIRIT COULD BE QUELLED BY LOOKING HIM STEADFASTLY IN THE EYE IT WAS HIS CUSTOM IN THE DAYTIME TO WALK ABOUT
332-128985-0013 CARRYING A DRAWN CUTLASS RESTING EASILY UPON HIS ARM EDGE UP VERY MUCH AS A FINE GENTLEMAN CARRIES HIS HIGH SILK HAT AND ANY ONE WHO SHOULD IMPERTINENTLY STARE OR ENDEAVOR TO QUELL HIS HIGH SPIRITS IN ANY OTHER WAY
332-128985-0014 WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
332-128985-0015 BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO STRICT AND EXACTING DURING THE BUSINESS SESSIONS OF HIS PIRATICAL YEAR BY WHICH I MEAN WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND AFTER PRIZES HE WAS VERY MUCH MORE DISAGREEABLE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A VACATION
332-128985-0016 ON HIS RETURN TO JAMAICA AFTER ONE OF HIS EXPEDITIONS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GIVE HIMSELF SOME RELAXATION AFTER THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO ROC TO GET HIMSELF THOROUGHLY DRUNK
332-128985-0017 WITH HIS CUTLASS WAVING HIGH IN THE AIR HE WOULD RUSH OUT INTO THE STREET AND TAKE A WHACK AT EVERY ONE WHOM HE MET AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE THE CITIZENS ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE THE STREET TO HIMSELF AND IT WAS NOT AT ALL LIKELY
332-128985-0018 THAT HIS VISITS TO JAMAICA WERE LOOKED FORWARD TO WITH ANY EAGER ANTICIPATIONS ROC IT MAY BE SAID WAS NOT ONLY A BLOODY PIRATE BUT A BLOODED ONE HE WAS THOROUGHBRED
332-128985-0019 FROM THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSERT HIS INDIVIDUALITY HE HAD BEEN A PIRATE AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EVER REFORM HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING ELSE THERE WERE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CASE
332-128985-0020 IN HIS NATURE THERE WAS NO ALLOY NOR MODERATION NOR FORBEARANCE THE APPRECIATIVE ESQUEMELING WHO MIGHT BE CALLED THE BOSWELL OF THE BUCCANEERS COULD NEVER HAVE MET HIS HERO ROC
332-128985-0021 WHEN THAT BUSHY BEARDED PIRATE WAS RUNNING AMUCK IN THE STREETS BUT IF HE HAD IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HE ASSURES US THAT WHEN ROC WAS NOT DRUNK HE WAS ESTEEMED BUT AT THE SAME TIME FEARED
332-128985-0022 BUT THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF GAINING ESTEEM AND ROC'S METHOD CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED VERY WELL IN THE CASE OF HIS LITERARY ASSOCIATE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE HATRED OF THE SPANIARDS BY THE BUCCANEERS BEGAN VERY EARLY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WEST INDIES
332-128985-0023 BUT IN ALL THE INSTANCES OF FEROCIOUS ENMITY TOWARD THE SPANIARDS THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING TO EQUAL THE FEELINGS OF ROC THE BRAZILIAN UPON THAT SUBJECT HIS DISLIKE TO EVERYTHING SPANISH AROSE HE DECLARED
332-128985-0024 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO BAD FOR A SPANIARD THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE WAS TO WAGE BITTER WAR AGAINST SPANISH SHIPS AND SPANISH SETTLEMENTS HE SELDOM GAVE ANY QUARTER TO HIS PRISONERS
332-128985-0025 THEN THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO BUT TO GO ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS AND PUT OUT TO SEA IN SEARCH OF SOME FRESH PRIZE SO FAR ROC'S CAREER HAD BEEN VERY MUCH LIKE THAT OF MANY OTHER COMPANIONS OF THE COAST
332-128985-0026 DIFFERING FROM THEM ONLY IN RESPECT TO INTENSITY AND FORCE BUT HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WITH IDEAS
332-128985-0027 HE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURING
332-128985-0028 AND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE ANY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE BAY WHICH WERE WELL LADEN AND WHICH WERE LIKELY SOON TO COME OUT SO WITH A SMALL BOAT FILLED WITH SOME OF HIS TRUSTY MEN HE ROWED QUIETLY INTO THE PORT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD DISCOVER
332-128985-0029 AND HAD SENT THAT MILD MANNERED OBSERVER INTO THE HARBOR TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
332-128985-0030 BUT HE CHOSE TO GO HIMSELF AND HE CAME TO GRIEF NO SOONER DID THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIPS LYING IN THE HARBOR BEHOLD A BOAT APPROACHING WITH A BIG BROWED BROAD JAWED MARINER SITTING IN THE STERN
332-128985-0031 AND WITH A GOOD MANY MORE BROAD BACKED HAIRY MARINERS THAN WERE NECESSARY PULLING AT THE OARS THAN THEY GAVE THE ALARM
332-128985-0032 ROC MUST HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN POWERS OR PERHAPS HE RELIED SOMEWHAT UPON THE FEAR WHICH HIS VERY PRESENCE EVOKED BUT HE MADE A MISTAKE THIS TIME HE HAD RUN INTO THE LION'S JAW AND THE LION HAD CLOSED HIS TEETH UPON HIM
332-128985-0033 WHEN THE PIRATE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF PUTTING THEM TO TRIAL BUCCANEERS WERE OUTLAWED BY THE SPANISH
332-128985-0034 AND WERE CONSIDERED AS WILD BEASTS TO BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WHEREVER CAUGHT CONSEQUENTLY ROC AND HIS MEN WERE THROWN INTO A DUNGEON AND CONDEMNED TO BE EXECUTED IF HOWEVER THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIMSELF
332-128985-0035 DURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATES
332-128985-0036 THIS WAS A BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH A CAPABLE PIRATE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PROFICIENT IF HE COULD NOT GET HIMSELF OUT OF SCRAPES HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CUTTING DOWN SENTINELS
332-128985-0037 OR JUMPING OVERBOARD WITH A COUPLE OF WINE JARS FOR A LIFE PRESERVER OR OF DOING ANY OF THOSE ORDINARY THINGS WHICH PIRATES WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHEN ESCAPING FROM THEIR CAPTORS
332-128985-0038 INSIDE OF A FORTRESS AND IF THEY ESCAPED FROM THIS THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF A BODY OF SPANISH SOLDIERS THEIR STOUT ARMS AND THEIR STOUT HEARTS WERE OF NO USE TO THEM NOW
332-128985-0039 AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVE
332-128985-0040 WHO CAME IN TO BRING HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND BY THE MEANS OF THIS MAN THE PIRATE HOPED TO PLAY A TRICK UPON THE GOVERNOR HE PROMISED THE SLAVE THAT IF HE WOULD HELP HIM AND HE TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO SO
332-128985-0041 HE WOULD GIVE HIM MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY HIS FREEDOM AND TO RETURN TO HIS FRIENDS AND THIS OF COURSE WAS A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO THE POOR FELLOW WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME THE SLAVE AGREED TO THE PROPOSALS
332-128985-0042 AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO BRING SOME WRITING MATERIALS TO ROC WHO THEREUPON BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF A LETTER
332-128985-0043 WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN
332-128985-0044 BY THE HAND OF ROC WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF ANY HARM SHOULD COME TO THESE BRAVE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AND IMPRISONED WHEN THEY WERE DOING NO HARM TO ANYBODY HE WOULD SWEAR IN HIS MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT NEVER
332-128985-0045 FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WOULD HE GIVE QUARTER TO ANY SPANIARD WHO MIGHT FALL INTO HIS HANDS AND HE MOREOVER THREATENED THAT ANY KIND OF VENGEANCE WHICH SHOULD BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THE BUCCANEERS AND FRENCH UNITED TO INFLICT UPON THE SPANISH SHIPS
332-128985-0046 OR UPON THE TOWN OF CAMPEACHY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER HE SHOULD HEAR OF ANY INJURY THAT MIGHT BE INFLICTED UPON THE UNFORTUNATE MEN WHO WERE THEN LYING IMPRISONED IN THE FORTRESS WHEN THE SLAVE CAME BACK TO ROC
332-128985-0047 THE LETTER WAS GIVEN TO HIM WITH VERY PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS AS TO WHAT HE WAS TO DO WITH IT HE WAS TO DISGUISE HIMSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND THEN IN THE NIGHT HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY OUT OF THE TOWN
332-128985-0048 AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS TO RETURN AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR WHEN HE WAS TO STATE THAT HE HAD BEEN PUT ON SHORE FROM THE FRENCH VESSEL IN THE OFFING WITH A LETTER WHICH HE WAS TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR THE SLAVE PERFORMED HIS PART OF THE BUSINESS VERY WELL
332-128985-0049 THE NEXT DAY WET AND BEDRAGGLED FROM MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEEDS AND MUD OF THE COAST HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE FORTRESS WITH HIS LETTER AND WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR NO ONE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A PERSON EMPLOYED ABOUT THE PLACE
332-128985-0050 HAVING FULFILLED HIS MISSION HE DEPARTED AND WHEN SEEN AGAIN HE WAS THE SAME SERVANT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO CARRY FOOD TO THE PRISONERS THE GOVERNOR READ THE LETTER WITH A DISQUIETED MIND
332-128985-0051 HE KNEW THAT THE FRENCH SHIP WHICH WAS LYING OUTSIDE THE HARBOR WAS A POWERFUL VESSEL AND HE DID NOT LIKE FRENCH SHIPS ANYWAY THE TOWN HAD ONCE BEEN TAKEN AND VERY BADLY TREATED BY A LITTLE FLEET OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUCCANEERS
332-128985-0052 AND HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO GREAT SPANISH FORCE IN THE HARBOR AT THAT TIME AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUCCANEERING VESSELS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER TOGETHER IN THE BAY
332-128985-0053 IF IT SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THAT THE GREAT PIRATE ROC HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH IN CAMPEACHY IT WAS AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A PRISONER TO HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FRIENDS SO NEAR BY AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK ROC'S CASE INTO MOST EARNEST CONSIDERATION
332-128985-0054 AND HE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE FELT HIMSELF IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO HAS STOLEN A BABY BEAR AND WHO HEARS THE ROAR OF AN APPROACHING PARENT THROUGH THE WOODS
332-128985-0055 TO THROW AWAY THE CUB AND WALK OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY BEARS IN THAT FOREST WOULD BE THE INCLINATION OF A MAN SO SITUATED AND TO GET RID OF THE GREAT PIRATE WITHOUT PROVOKING THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
332-128985-0056 WAS THE NATURAL INCLINATION OF THE GOVERNOR NOW ROC AND HIS MEN WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVING BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR WERE TOLD THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR HAVING COMMITTED NO OVERT ACT OF DISORDER THEY WOULD BE SET AT LIBERTY AND SHIPPED TO ENGLAND
332-128985-0057 UPON THE SINGLE CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD ABANDON PIRACY AND AGREE TO BECOME QUIET CITIZENS IN WHATEVER RESPECTABLE VOCATION THEY MIGHT SELECT TO THESE TERMS ROC AND HIS MEN AGREED WITHOUT ARGUMENT
332-128985-0058 THEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RETIRE FROM THE BUCCANEERING BUSINESS AND THAT NOTHING WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF CIVILIZATION AND VIRTUE THERE WAS A SHIP ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SPAIN AND ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GAVE ROC AND HIS MEN FREE PASSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN
332-128985-0059 THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OUR BUCCANEERS WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED TO HAVE BEEN PUT ON BOARD THE FRENCH VESSEL BUT AS THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD STARTED HIS PRISONERS ON THE ROAD TO REFORM HE DID NOT WISH TO THROW THEM INTO THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
332-128985-0060 BY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT
332-128985-0061 ON THE VOYAGE TO SPAIN ROC WAS ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO BEHAVE VERY WELL WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NO DOUBT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY DULL DAYS ON BOARD SHIP
332-128985-0062 WHEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO GAMBLE TO GET DRUNK AND TO RUN AMUCK UP AND DOWN THE DECK BUT HE CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM ALL THESE RECREATIONS AND SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE SUCH AN ABLE BODIED AND WILLING SAILOR
332-128985-0063 THAT THE CAPTAIN ALLOWED HIM TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE CREW ROC KNEW HOW TO DO A GREAT MANY THINGS NOT ONLY COULD HE MURDER AND ROB BUT HE KNEW HOW TO TURN AN HONEST PENNY WHEN THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF FILLING HIS PURSE HE HAD LEARNED AMONG THE INDIANS
332-128985-0064 HOW TO SHOOT FISH WITH BOW AND ARROWS AND ON THIS VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HE OCCUPIED ALL HIS SPARE TIME IN SITTING IN THE RIGGING AND SHOOTING THE FISH WHICH DISPORTED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE VESSEL
332-128985-0065 THESE FISH HE SOLD TO THE OFFICERS AND WE ARE TOLD THAT IN THIS WAY HE EARNED NO LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS PERHAPS THAT MANY DOLLARS IF THIS ACCOUNT IS TRUE FISH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY COSTLY IN THOSE DAYS
332-128985-0066 IN EVERY WAY ROC BEHAVED SO WELL THAT FOR HIS SAKE ALL HIS MEN WERE TREATED KINDLY AND ALLOWED MANY PRIVILEGES BUT WHEN THIS PARTY OF REFORMED PIRATES REACHED SPAIN AND WERE ALLOWED TO GO WHERE THEY PLEASED
332-128985-0067 THEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE OATHS THEY HAD TAKEN TO ABANDON PIRACY THAN THEY THOUGHT OF THE OATHS WHICH THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING RIGHT AND LEFT
332-128985-0068 BUT AS SOON AS THEY COULD MANAGE IT THEY SAILED BACK TO THE WEST INDIES AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN JAMAICA
332-128985-0069 NOT ONLY DID ROC CAST FROM HIM EVERY THOUGHT OF REFORMATION AND A RESPECTABLE LIFE BUT HE DETERMINED TO BEGIN THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY ON A GRANDER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE HE MADE A COMPACT WITH AN OLD FRENCH BUCCANEER
332-128985-0070 AND WITH A LARGE COMPANY OF BUCCANEERS HE ACTUALLY SET OUT TO TAKE A TOWN HAVING LOST EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND HAVING PASSED SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYMENT MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF SHOOTING FISH WITH A BOW AND ARROWS
332-128985-0071 OUR DOUGHTY PIRATE NOW DESIRED TO MAKE A GRAND STRIKE AND IF HE COULD TAKE A TOWN AND PILLAGE IT OF EVERYTHING VALUABLE IT CONTAINED HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD FORTUNE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND MIGHT RETIRE IF HE CHOSE
332-128985-0072 FROM THE ACTIVE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION
332-128985-0073 IN YUCATAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A BOLD AND RASH UNDERTAKING THE TWO PIRATES WERE BOLD AND RASH ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ROC HAD BEEN A PRISONER IN MERIDA AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOWN HE BELIEVED THAT HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS COULD LAND UPON THE COAST
332-128985-0074 IF THEY COULD DO THIS IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER TO RUSH UPON THE UNSUSPECTING GARRISON AND HAVING ANNIHILATED THESE MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE TOWN BUT THEIR PLANS DID NOT WORK VERY WELL THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY SOME INDIANS
332-128985-0075 AFTER THEY HAD LANDED WHO HURRIED TO MERIDA AND GAVE NOTICE OF THE APPROACH OF THE BUCCANEERS CONSEQUENTLY WHEN ROC AND HIS COMPANIONS REACHED THE TOWN THEY FOUND THE GARRISON PREPARED FOR THEM CANNONS LOADED AND ALL THE APPROACHES GUARDED
332-128985-0076 STILL THE PIRATES DID NOT HESITATE THEY ADVANCED FIERCELY TO THE ATTACK JUST AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE BOARDING A SPANISH VESSEL BUT THEY SOON FOUND THAT FIGHTING ON LAND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING AT SEA
332-128985-0077 IN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTED
332-128985-0078 AND THEY WERE THEREFORE GREATLY DISMAYED WHEN A PARTY OF HORSEMEN FROM THE TOWN WHO HAD MADE A WIDE DETOUR THROUGH THE WOODS SUDDENLY CHARGED UPON THEIR REAR
332-128985-0079 TRIBUTOR AND A GREAT MANY OF THE PIRATES WERE KILLED OR TAKEN AND ROC THE BRAZILIAN HAD A TERRIBLE FALL THIS MOST MEMORABLE FALL OCCURRED IN THE ESTIMATION OF JOHN ESQUEMELING
332-128985-0080 WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK ON MERIDA AND WHO WROTE THE ACCOUNT OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO BE CALLED UPON TO RECORD THAT HIS GREAT HERO ROC THE BRAZILIAN SAVED HIS LIFE AFTER THE UTTER DEFEAT OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONS
332-128985-0081 BY IGNOMINIOUSLY RUNNING AWAY THE LOYAL CHRONICLER HAD AS FIRM A BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE INABILITY OF HIS HERO TO FLY FROM DANGER AS WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTTISH DOUGLAS WHEN HE STOOD
332-128985-0082 COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
332-128985-0083 WHO WOULD EVEN SURRENDER TO SAY NOTHING OF RUNNING AWAY THAT ESQUEMELING COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT ROC HAD RETREATED FROM HIS ENEMIES DESERTED HIS FRIENDS AND TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS SO TRUCULENTLY PROCLAIMED
332-128985-0084 BUT THIS DOWNFALL OF A HERO SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ESQUEMELING ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PIRATICAL BODY AND WAS PROUD TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A BUCCANEER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF A PIRATE UNDER THE BRUTALITY
332-128985-0085 THE CRUELTY THE DISHONESTY AND THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE SEA ROBBERS OF THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS MEANNESS AND COWARDICE ROC AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SKETCH WAS A TYPICAL PIRATE
332-128985-0086 UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED HIMSELF TO HAVE ALL THOSE BRAVE AND SAVAGE QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING ESTEEMED AND REVERED AND UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED THOSE OTHER QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING DESPISED
332-128985-0087 BUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE TRUE CHARACTER OF A PIRATE THE HISTORIAN JOHN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH CUT UP BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS FAVORITE HERO HAD ROUNDED OFF HIS PIRATICAL CAREER
332-128985-0088 AND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLES
