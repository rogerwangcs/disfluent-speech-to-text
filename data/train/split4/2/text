3240-131231-0000 ATTEMPTS TO PRESERVE THE SYSTEM THAT SMALL FROGS AND TOADS FOR INSTANCE NEVER HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY BUT WERE ON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE OR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH FALLS UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
3240-131231-0001 WERE THERE SOME ESPECIALLY FROGGY PLACE NEAR EUROPE AS THERE IS AN ESPECIALLY SANDY PLACE THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION WOULD OF COURSE BE THAT ALL SMALL FROGS FALLING FROM THE SKY IN EUROPE COME FROM THAT CENTER OF FROGEITY TO START WITH
3240-131231-0002 I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT I AM PERMITTED TO SEE BECAUSE I AM STILL PRIMITIVE OR INTELLIGENT OR IN A STATE OF MALADJUSTMENT
3240-131231-0003 OF A FALL OF TADPOLES FROM THE SKY AS TO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0004 THE WRITER SAYS THAT ALL OBSERVERS WERE MISTAKEN THAT THE FROGS OR TOADS MUST HAVE FALLEN FROM TREES OR OTHER PLACES OVERHEAD TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF LITTLE TOADS ONE OR TWO MONTHS OLD
3240-131231-0005 THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM A GREAT THICK CLOUD THAT APPEARED SUDDENLY IN A SKY THAT HAD BEEN CLOUDLESS AUGUST EIGHTEEN O FOUR NEAR TOULOUSE FRANCE ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM PROFESSOR PONTUS TO M ARAGO
3240-131231-0006 MANY INSTANCES OF FROGS THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0007 AS TO HAVING BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0008 JULY THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0009 LITTLE TOADS FOUND IN A DESERT AFTER A RAINFALL NOTES AND QUERIES
3240-131231-0010 TO START WITH I DO NOT DENY POSITIVELY THE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION OF UP AND DOWN I THINK THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SUCH OCCURRENCES I OMIT MANY NOTES THAT I HAVE UPON INDISTINGUISHABLES
3240-131231-0011 IN THE LONDON TIMES JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF A SHOWER OF TWIGS AND LEAVES AND TINY TOADS IN A STORM UPON THE SLOPES OF THE APENNINES THESE MAY HAVE BEEN THE EJECTAMENTA OF A WHIRLWIND I ADD HOWEVER
3240-131231-0012 THAT I HAVE NOTES UPON TWO OTHER FALLS OF TINY TOADS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE ONE IN FRANCE AND ONE IN TAHITI ALSO OF FISH IN SCOTLAND BUT IN THE PHENOMENON OF THE APENNINES THE MIXTURE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF THE PRODUCTS OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0013 THE OTHER INSTANCES SEEM TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF SOMETHING LIKE MIGRATION THEIR GREAT NUMBERS AND THEIR HOMOGENEITY OVER AND OVER IN THESE ANNALS OF THE DAMNED OCCURS THE DATUM OF SEGREGATION
3240-131231-0014 BUT A WHIRLWIND IS THOUGHT OF AS A CONDITION OF CHAOS QUASI CHAOS
3240-131231-0015 MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JULY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE A SMALL POND IN THE TRACK OF THE CLOUD WAS SUCKED DRY THE WATER BEING CARRIED OVER THE ADJOINING FIELDS TOGETHER WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF SOFT MUD WHICH WAS SCATTERED OVER THE GROUND FOR HALF A MILE AROUND
3240-131231-0016 BUT HERE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SCOOP IN THE EXCLUSIONIST IMAGINATION THERE IS NO REGARD FOR MUD DEBRIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF A POND FLOATING VEGETATION LOOSE THINGS FROM THE SHORES BUT A PRECISE PICKING OUT OF FROGS ONLY
3240-131231-0017 OF ALL INSTANCES I HAVE THAT ATTRIBUTE THE FALL OF SMALL FROGS OR TOADS TO WHIRLWINDS ONLY ONE DEFINITELY IDENTIFIES OR PLACES THE WHIRLWIND ALSO AS HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE A POND GOING UP WOULD BE QUITE AS INTERESTING AS FROGS COMING DOWN
3240-131231-0018 WHIRLWINDS WE READ OF OVER AND OVER BUT WHERE AND WHAT WHIRLWIND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANYBODY WHO HAD LOST A POND WOULD BE HEARD FROM IN SYMONS METEOROLOGICAL MAGAZINE
3240-131231-0019 A FALL OF SMALL FROGS NEAR BIRMINGHAM ENGLAND JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO IS ATTRIBUTED TO A SPECIFIC WHIRLWIND BUT NOT A WORD AS TO ANY SPECIAL POND THAT HAD CONTRIBUTED
3240-131231-0020 AND SOMETHING THAT STRIKES MY ATTENTION HERE IS THAT THESE FROGS ARE DESCRIBED AS ALMOST WHITE I'M AFRAID THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR US WE SHALL HAVE TO GIVE TO CIVILIZATION UPON THIS EARTH SOME NEW WORLDS PLACES WITH WHITE FROGS IN THEM
3240-131231-0021 IN SPITE OF ALL WE THINK WE KNOW OF THE ACCELERATIVE VELOCITY OF FALLING BODIES AND HAVE PROPAGATED WHY THE EXOTIC BECOMES THE INDIGENOUS OR FROM THE STRANGEST OF PLACES WE'D EXPECT THE FAMILIAR OR
3240-131231-0022 IF HOSTS OF LIVING FROGS HAVE COME HERE FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE EVERY LIVING THING UPON THIS EARTH MAY ANCESTRALLY HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE I FIND THAT I HAVE ANOTHER NOTE UPON A SPECIFIC HURRICANE
3240-131231-0023 AFTER ONE OF THE GREATEST HURRICANES IN THE HISTORY OF IRELAND SOME FISH WERE FOUND AS FAR AS FIFTEEN YARDS FROM THE EDGE OF A LAKE HAVE ANOTHER THIS IS A GOOD ONE FOR THE EXCLUSIONISTS FALL OF FISH IN PARIS SAID THAT A NEIGHBORING POND HAD BEEN BLOWN DRY
3240-131231-0024 DATE NOT GIVEN BUT I HAVE SEEN IT RECORDED SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BEST KNOWN FALL OF FISHES FROM THE SKY IS THAT WHICH OCCURRED AT MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0025 FEBRUARY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE THE EDITOR OF THE ZOOLOGIST
3240-131231-0026 HAVING PUBLISHED A REPORT OF A FALL OF FISHES WRITES I AM CONTINUALLY RECEIVING SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF FROGS AND FISHES BUT IN ALL THE VOLUMES OF THE ZOOLOGIST I CAN FIND ONLY TWO REPORTS OF SUCH FALLS THERE IS NOTHING TO CONCLUDE
3240-131231-0027 OTHER THAN THAT HOSTS OF DATA HAVE BEEN LOST BECAUSE ORTHODOXY DOES NOT LOOK FAVORABLY UPON SUCH REPORTS THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW RECORDS SEVERAL FALLS OF FISHES IN THE UNITED STATES
3240-131231-0028 NEVERTHELESS THE TREATMENT BY THE ZOOLOGIST OF THE FALL REPORTED FROM MOUNTAIN ASH IS FAIR FIRST APPEARS
3240-131231-0029 VICAR OF ABEDARE ASSERTING THAT THE FALL HAD OCCURRED CHIEFLY UPON THE PROPERTY OF MISTER NIXON OF MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0030 OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BRISTLING WITH EXCLUSIONISM WRITES THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM ALIVE WERE VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HE SAYS ON READING THE EVIDENCE IT SEEMS TO ME MOST PROBABLY ONLY A PRACTICAL JOKE
3240-131231-0031 THE EDITOR SAYS THAT ONE WAS A MINNOW AND THAT THE REST WERE STICKLEBACKS HE SAYS THAT DOCTOR GRAY'S EXPLANATION IS NO DOUBT RIGHT BUT
3240-131231-0032 HE PUBLISHES A LETTER FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT WHO APOLOGIZES FOR OPPOSING SO HIGH AN AUTHORITY AS DOCTOR GRAY BUT SAYS THAT HE HAD OBTAINED SOME OF THESE FISHES FROM PERSONS WHO LIVED AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE APART
3240-131231-0033 OR CONSIDERABLY OUT OF RANGE OF THE PLAYFUL PAIL OF WATER ACCORDING TO THE ANNUAL REGISTER
3240-131231-0034 THE FISHES THEMSELVES HAD FALLEN BY PAILFULS IF THESE FISHES WERE NOT UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE WE BASE OUR OBJECTIONS TO THE WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION UPON TWO DATA THAT THEY FELL IN NO SUCH DISTRIBUTION AS ONE COULD ATTRIBUTE TO THE DISCHARGE OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0035 THAT TEN MINUTES LATER ANOTHER FALL OF FISHES OCCURRED UPON THIS SAME NARROW STRIP OF LAND EVEN ARGUING THAT A WHIRLWIND MAY STAND STILL AXIALLY IT DISCHARGES TANGENTIALLY WHEREVER THE FISHES CAME FROM IT DOES NOT SEEM THINKABLE
3240-131231-0036 THAT SOME COULD HAVE FALLEN AND THAT OTHERS COULD HAVE WHIRLED EVEN A TENTH OF A MINUTE THEN FALLING DIRECTLY AFTER THE FIRST TO FALL BECAUSE OF THESE EVIL CIRCUMSTANCES THE BEST ADAPTATION WAS TO LAUGH THE WHOLE THING OFF
3240-131231-0037 VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HAD BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH SECOND EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE IS A LETTER FROM MISTER AARON ROBERTS CURATE OF SAINT PETER'S CARMATHON IN THIS LETTER
3240-131231-0038 BUT THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF SPECIES I THINK MYSELF THAT THEY WERE MINNOWS AND STICKLEBACKS SOME PERSONS THINKING THEM TO BE SEA FISHES PLACED THEM IN SALT WATER ACCORDING TO MISTER ROBERTS
3240-131231-0039 SOME WERE PLACED IN FRESH WATER THESE SEEMED TO THRIVE WELL AS TO NARROW DISTRIBUTION WE ARE TOLD THAT THE FISHES FELL IN AND ABOUT THE PREMISES OF MISTER NIXON IT WAS NOT OBSERVED AT THE TIME THAT ANY FISH FELL IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
3240-131231-0040 SAVE IN THE PARTICULAR SPOT MENTIONED IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE VICAR GRIFFITH WRITES AN ACCOUNT THE ROOFS OF SOME HOUSES WERE COVERED WITH THEM
3240-131231-0041 IN THIS LETTER IT IS SAID THAT THE LARGEST FISHES WERE FIVE INCHES LONG AND THAT THESE DID NOT SURVIVE THE FALL REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION
3240-131231-0042 THE EVIDENCE OF THE FALL OF FISH ON THIS OCCASION WAS VERY CONCLUSIVE A SPECIMEN OF THE FISH WAS EXHIBITED
3240-131231-0043 LEIRUS GASTEROSTEUS IS THE STICKLEBACK ALTOGETHER I THINK WE HAVE NOT A SENSE OF TOTAL PERDITION
3240-131231-0044 IN WHICH WERE THOUSANDS OF FISHES FOUR OR FIVE INCHES LONG SOME OF WHICH COVERED ROOFS OF HOUSES AND SOME OF WHICH REMAINED TEN MINUTES IN THE AIR BY WAY OF CONTRAST WE OFFER OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE THAT THE BOTTOM OF A SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL POND HAD DROPPED OUT
3240-131231-0045 I HAVE A GREAT MANY NOTES UPON THE FALL OF FISHES DESPITE THE DIFFICULTY THESE RECORDS HAVE IN GETTING THEMSELVES PUBLISHED BUT I PICK OUT THE INSTANCES THAT ESPECIALLY RELATE TO OUR SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL ACCEPTANCES
3240-131231-0046 THAT HAVE FALLEN WITH A DISTRIBUTION NARROWER THAN IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A WHIRLWIND THAT HAVE FALLEN FOR A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME UPON THE SAME NARROW AREA OF LAND THESE THREE FACTORS INDICATE SOMEWHERE NOT FAR ALOFT
3240-131231-0047 A REGION OF INERTNESS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION OF COURSE HOWEVER A REGION THAT BY THE FLUX AND VARIATION OF ALL THINGS MUST AT TIMES BE SUSCEPTIBLE BUT AFTERWARD OUR HERESY WILL BIFURCATE
3240-131231-0048 IN AMIABLE ACCOMMODATION TO THE CRUCIFIXION IT'LL GET I THINK BUT SO IMPRESSED ARE WE WITH THE DATUM THAT THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF SMALL FROGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0049 THAT TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ANOTHER ADJUSTMENT MUST BE MADE APART FROM OUR THREE FACTORS OF INDICATION AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVATION IS THE FALL OF LIVING THINGS WITHOUT INJURY TO THEM
3240-131231-0050 SOMETHING ELSE APART FROM OUR THREE MAIN INTERESTS IS A PHENOMENON THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL AN ALTERNATING SERIES OF FALLS OF FISHES WHATEVER THE SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE
3240-131231-0051 JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0052 FIFESHIRE SCOTLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR
3240-131231-0053 MORADABAD INDIA JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0054 ROSS SHIRE SCOTLAND EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0055 MORADABAD INDIA JULY TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE
3240-131231-0056 FERIDPOOR INDIA FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY
3240-131231-0057 DISREGARDING SERIAL SIGNIFICANCE OR MECHANICAL UNINTELLIGENT REPULSIVE REFLEX IS THAT THE FISHES OF INDIA DID NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY WERE FOUND UPON THE GROUND AFTER TORRENTIAL RAINS BECAUSE STREAMS HAD OVERFLOWED AND HAD THEN RECEDED
3240-131231-0058 IN THE REGION OF INERTNESS THAT WE THINK WE CAN CONCEIVE OF OR A ZONE THAT IS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION VERY MUCH LIKE THE NEUTRAL ZONE OF A MAGNET'S ATTRACTION WE ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE BODIES OF WATER AND ALSO CLEAR SPACES BOTTOMS OF PONDS DROPPING OUT
3240-131231-0059 REMAIN AND DRY OR EVEN PUTREFY THEN SOMETIMES FALLING BY ATMOSPHERIC DISLODGMENT AFTER A TREMENDOUS DELUGE OF RAIN ONE OF THE HEAVIEST FALLS ON RECORD
3240-131231-0060 JULY TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY
3240-131231-0061 THE WORD FOUND IS AGREEABLE TO THE REPULSIONS OF THE CONVENTIONALISTS AND THEIR CONCEPT OF AN OVERFLOWING STREAM BUT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE FOUND ON THE TOPS OF HAYSTACKS FERREL
3240-131231-0062 TELLS OF A FALL OF LIVING FISHES SOME OF THEM HAVING BEEN PLACED IN A TANK WHERE THEY SURVIVED THAT OCCURRED IN INDIA ABOUT TWENTY MILES SOUTH OF CALCUTTA SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE A WITNESS OF THIS FALL SAYS
3240-131231-0063 THE MOST STRANGE THING WHICH EVER STRUCK ME WAS THAT THE FISH DID NOT FALL HELTER SKELTER OR HERE AND THERE BUT THEY FELL IN A STRAIGHT LINE NOT MORE THAN A CUBIT IN BREADTH
3240-131231-0064 THAT ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY TAKEN BEFORE A MAGISTRATE A FALL OCCURRED FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NEAR FERIDPOOR INDIA OF MANY FISHES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME WHOLE AND FRESH AND OTHERS MUTILATED AND PUTREFYING
3240-131231-0065 OR TO THOSE WHO HOLD OUT FOR SEGREGATION IN A WHIRLWIND OR THAT OBJECTS SAY TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE LIGHTER WE POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS IN THE JOURNAL OF THE ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL
3240-131231-0066 SOME OF THE FISH WERE FRESH BUT OTHERS WERE ROTTEN AND WITHOUT HEADS AMONG THE NUMBER WHICH I GOT FIVE WERE FRESH AND THE REST STINKING AND HEADLESS THEY REMIND US OF HIS GRACE'S OBSERVATION OF SOME PAGES BACK
3240-131231-0067 ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WEIGHED ONE AND A HALF POUNDS EACH AND OTHERS THREE POUNDS A FALL OF FISHES AT FUTTEPOOR INDIA MAY SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE THEY WERE ALL DEAD AND DRY
3240-131231-0068 A CORRESPONDENT WRITES FROM THE DOVE MARINE LABORATORY CUTTERCOATS ENGLAND THAT AT HINDON A SUBURB OF SUNDERLAND AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS OF SMALL FISHES IDENTIFIED AS SAND EELS HAD FALLEN
3240-131231-0069 AGAIN THE SMALL AREA ABOUT SIXTY BY THIRTY YARDS THE FALL OCCURRED DURING A HEAVY RAIN THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER
3240-131231-0070 BUT BY NO VISIBLE LIGHTNING THE SEA IS CLOSE TO HINDON BUT IF YOU TRY TO THINK OF THESE FISHES HAVING DESCRIBED A TRAJECTORY IN A WHIRLWIND FROM THE OCEAN CONSIDER THIS REMARKABLE DATUM THAT
3240-131231-0071 ACCORDING TO WITNESSES THE FALL UPON THIS SMALL AREA OCCUPIED TEN MINUTES I CANNOT THINK OF A CLEARER INDICATION OF A DIRECT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND
3240-131231-0072 THE FISH WERE ALL DEAD AND INDEED STIFF AND HARD WHEN PICKED UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OCCURRENCE BY ALL OF WHICH I MEAN THAT WE HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO PILE UP OUR DATA OF THINGS THAT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE OVERHEAD
3240-131231-0073 WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP THE SUBJECT FROM MANY APPROACHES BEFORE OUR ACCEPTANCE WHICH SEEMS QUITE AS RIGOROUSLY ARRIVED AT AS EVER HAS BEEN A BELIEF CAN EMERGE FROM THE ACCURSED I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE HORSE AND THE BARN WILL HELP US TO EMERGE
3240-131231-0074 BUT IF EVER ANYTHING DID GO UP FROM THIS EARTH'S SURFACE AND STAY UP THOSE DAMNED THINGS MAY HAVE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN A TORNADO IN WISCONSIN MAY TWENTY THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0075 A BARN AND A HORSE WERE CARRIED COMPLETELY AWAY AND NEITHER HORSE NOR BARN NOR ANY PORTION OF EITHER HAVE SINCE BEEN FOUND AFTER THAT WHICH WOULD BE A LITTLE STRONG WERE IT NOT FOR A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN OUR DIGESTIONS THAT I NOTE AS WE GO ALONG
3240-131231-0076 THERE IS LITTLE OF THE BIZARRE OR THE UNASSIMILABLE IN THE TURTLE THAT HOVERED SIX MONTHS OR SO OVER A SMALL TOWN IN MISSISSIPPI MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131231-0077 FELL A SMALL PIECE OF ALABASTER THAT AT BOVINA EIGHT MILES FROM VICKSBURG FELL A GOPHER TURTLE THEY FELL IN A HAILSTORM THIS ITEM WAS WIDELY COPIED AT THE TIME FOR INSTANCE NATURE
3240-131231-0078 AS TO DISCUSSION NOT A WORD OR SCIENCE AND ITS CONTINUITY WITH PRESBYTERIANISM DATA LIKE THIS ARE DAMNED AT BIRTH THE WEATHER REVIEW DOES SPRINKLE OR BAPTIZE OR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THIS INFANT
3240-131231-0079 BUT IN ALL THE METEOROLOGICAL LITERATURE THAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH AFTER THAT DATE NOT A WORD EXCEPT MENTION ONCE OR TWICE THE EDITOR OF THE REVIEW SAYS
3240-131231-0080 AN EXAMINATION OF THE WEATHER MAP SHOWS THAT THESE HAILSTORMS OCCUR ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF A REGION OF COLD NORTHERLY WINDS AND WERE BUT A SMALL PART OF A SERIES OF SIMILAR STORMS
3240-131231-0081 OF ALL INCREDIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM I GIVE FIRST PLACE TO A NOTION OF A WHIRLWIND POUNCING UPON A REGION
3240-131231-0082 THIS TIME THE OTHER MECHANICAL THING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE CANNOT RISE IN RESPONSE TO ITS STIMULUS IT IS RESISTED IN THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE COATED WITH ICE MONTH OF MAY IN A SOUTHERN STATE IF A WHIRLWIND AT ALL
3240-131231-0083 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED SELECTION THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE FALL OF OTHER OBJECTS BUT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT IN THE REVIEW TO SPECIFY A WHIRLWIND THESE STRANGELY ASSOCIATED THINGS WERE REMARKABLY SEPARATED THEY FELL EIGHT MILES APART
3240-131231-0084 THEN AS IF THERE WERE REAL REASONING THEY MUST HAVE BEEN HIGH TO FALL WITH SUCH DIVERGENCE OR ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED PARTLY HORIZONTALLY EIGHT MILES FARTHER THAN THE OTHER BUT EITHER SUPPOSITION ARGUES FOR POWER MORE THAN THAT OF A LOCAL WHIRL OR GUST
3240-131231-0085 OR ARGUES FOR A GREAT SPECIFIC DISTURBANCE OF WHICH THERE IS NO RECORD FOR THE MONTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131232-0000 THEN I THINK OF A HURRICANE THAT OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WEEKS OR MONTHS BEFORE MAY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR NO I DON'T LOOK FOR IT AND INEVITABLY FIND IT OR THAT THINGS CAN GO UP SO HIGH IN HURRICANES THAT THEY STAY UP INDEFINITELY
3240-131232-0001 BUT MAY AFTER A WHILE BE SHAKEN DOWN BY STORMS
3240-131232-0002 SO THEN THAT THE TURTLE AND THE PIECE OF ALABASTER MAY HAVE HAD FAR DIFFERENT ORIGINS FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS PERHAPS HAVE ENTERED A REGION OF SUSPENSION OVER THIS EARTH WAFTING NEAR EACH OTHER LONG DURATION
3240-131232-0003 FINAL PRECIPITATION BY ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WITH HAIL OR THAT HAILSTONES TOO WHEN LARGE ARE PHENOMENA OF SUSPENSION OF LONG DURATION THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE VERY LARGE ONES COULD BECOME SO GREAT ONLY IN FALLING FROM THE CLOUDS
3240-131232-0004 LONG DURATION OTHER INDICATIONS OF LONG DURATION I THINK OF A REGION SOMEWHERE ABOVE THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN WHICH GRAVITATION IS INOPERATIVE AND IS NOT GOVERNED BY THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE
3240-131232-0005 QUITE AS MAGNETISM IS NEGLIGIBLE AT A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FROM A MAGNET THEORETICALLY THE ATTRACTION OF A MAGNET SHOULD DECREASE WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BUT THE FALLING OFF IS FOUND TO BE ALMOST ABRUPT AT A SHORT DISTANCE
3240-131232-0006 HORSES AND BARNS AND ELEPHANTS AND FLIES AND DODOES MOAS AND PTERODACTYLS LEAVES FROM MODERN TREES AND LEAVES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS ERA ALL HOWEVER TENDING TO DISINTEGRATE INTO HOMOGENEOUS LOOKING MUDS OR DUSTS
3240-131232-0007 RED OR BLACK OR YELLOW TREASURE TROVES FOR THE PALAEONTOLOGISTS AND FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ACCUMULATIONS OF CENTURIES CYCLONES OF EGYPT GREECE AND ASSYRIA FISHES DRIED AND HARD THERE A SHORT TIME OTHERS THERE LONG ENOUGH TO PUTREFY
3240-131232-0008 BUT THE OMNIPRESENCE OF HETEROGENEITY OR LIVING FISHES ALSO PONDS OF FRESH WATER OCEANS OF SALT WATER AS TO THE LAW OF GRAVITATION I PREFER TO TAKE ONE SIMPLE STAND
3240-131232-0009 ORTHODOXY ACCEPTS THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES GRAVITATION IS ONE OF THESE FORCES ALL OTHER FORCES HAVE PHENOMENA OF REPULSION AND OF INERTNESS IRRESPECTIVE OF DISTANCE AS WELL AS OF ATTRACTION
3240-131232-0010 BUT NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION ADMITS ATTRACTION ONLY THEN NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION CAN BE ONLY ONE THIRD ACCEPTABLE EVEN TO THE ORTHODOX OR THERE IS DENIAL OF THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES OR STILL SIMPLER HERE ARE THE DATA
3240-131232-0011 THOUGH IT HARMONIZES WITH DATA OF FISHES THAT FALL AS IF FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND OF COURSE WITH OTHER DATA TOO IS INADEQUATE TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO PECULIARITIES OF THE FALLS OF FROGS THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF TADPOLES BEEN REPORTED
3240-131232-0012 THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF FULL GROWN FROGS BEEN REPORTED ALWAYS FROGS A FEW MONTHS OLD IT SOUNDS POSITIVE BUT IF THERE BE SUCH REPORTS THEY ARE SOMEWHERE OUT OF MY RANGE OF READING BUT TADPOLES WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SKY THAN WOULD FROGS
3240-131232-0013 LITTLE OR BIG IF SUCH FALLS BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHIRLWINDS AND MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA IF THOUGH VERY TENTATIVELY AND PROVISIONALLY WE ACCEPT THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA
3240-131232-0014 BEFORE WE TAKE UP AN ESPECIAL EXPRESSION UPON THE FALL OF IMMATURE AND LARVAL FORMS OF LIFE TO THIS EARTH AND THE NECESSITY THEN OF CONCEIVING OF SOME FACTOR BESIDES MERE STATIONARINESS OR SUSPENSION OR STAGNATION
3240-131232-0015 THERE ARE OTHER DATA THAT ARE SIMILAR TO DATA OF FALLS OF FISHES SCIENCE GOSSIP
3240-131232-0016 THAT SMALL SNAILS OF A LAND SPECIES HAD FALLEN NEAR REDRUTH CORNWALL JULY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX DURING A HEAVY THUNDERSTORM ROADS AND FIELDS STREWN WITH THEM SO THAT THEY WERE GATHERED UP BY THE HATFUL
3240-131232-0017 NONE SEEN TO FALL BY THE WRITER OF THIS ACCOUNT SNAILS SAID TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT TO ANY PREVIOUSLY KNOWN IN THIS DISTRICT
3240-131232-0018 OF GREAT AND DESERVED REPUTE I THOUGHT I SHOULD FOR ONCE LIKE TO TRACE THE ORIGIN OF ONE OF THESE FABULOUS TALES OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE IS THAT JUSTICE CANNOT BE IN AN INTERMEDIATE EXISTENCE
3240-131232-0019 IN WHICH THERE CAN BE APPROXIMATION ONLY TO JUSTICE OR TO INJUSTICE THAT TO BE FAIR IS TO HAVE NO OPINION AT ALL THAT TO BE HONEST IS TO BE UNINTERESTED THAT TO INVESTIGATE IS TO ADMIT PREJUDICE THAT NOBODY HAS EVER REALLY INVESTIGATED ANYTHING
3240-131232-0020 BUT HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT POSITIVELY TO PROVE OR TO DISPROVE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONCEIVED OF OR SUSPECTED IN ADVANCE AS I SUSPECTED SAYS THIS CORRESPONDENT I FOUND THAT THE SNAILS WERE OF A FAMILIAR LAND SPECIES THAT THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND
3240-131232-0021 IN THE FIRST PLACE HE FOUND THAT THE SNAILS HAD APPEARED AFTER THE RAIN THAT ASTONISHED RUSTICS HAD JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY HAD FALLEN HE MET ONE PERSON WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN THE SNAILS FALL THIS WAS HIS ERROR SAYS THE INVESTIGATOR
3240-131232-0022 IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT THEY WERE SHOVELED UP IT IS SAID THAT THE SNAILS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A LOCAL SPECIES
3240-131232-0023 AND THAT IN HIS OPINION THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME UNUSUAL CONDITION ALOFT COMES OUT IN HIS OBSERVATION UPON THE CURIOUS AZURE BLUE APPEARANCE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME
3240-131232-0024 THAT ACCORDING TO DAS WETTER DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO UPON AUGUST NINTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A YELLOW CLOUD APPEARED OVER PADERBORN GERMANY FROM THIS CLOUD FELL A TORRENTIAL RAIN IN WHICH WERE HUNDREDS OF MUSSELS
3240-131232-0025 THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE NOR OF A WHIRLWIND LIZARDS
3240-131232-0026 THAT DURING A HEAVY SHOWER JULY THIRD EIGHTEEN SIXTY HE HEARD A PECULIAR SOUND AT HIS FEET AND LOOKING DOWN SAW A SNAKE LYING AS IF STUNNED BY A FALL IT THEN CAME TO LIFE GRAY SNAKE ABOUT A FOOT LONG
3240-131232-0027 THESE DATA HAVE ANY MEANING OR LACK OF MEANING OR DEGREE OF DAMNATION YOU PLEASE BUT IN THE MATTER OF THE FALL THAT OCCURRED AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE OCCUR SOME STRONG SIGNIFICANCES
3240-131232-0028 OUR QUASI REASONING UPON THIS SUBJECT APPLIES TO ALL SEGREGATIONS SO FAR CONSIDERED MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT
3240-131232-0029 RATHER STRICTLY LOCALIZED OR IN A SPACE OF TWO BLOCKS AND AFTER A VIOLENT STORM IN WHICH THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS SNAKES WERE FOUND THEY WERE CRAWLING ON SIDEWALKS IN YARDS AND IN STREETS AND IN MASSES
3240-131232-0030 BUT NONE WERE FOUND ON ROOFS OR ANY OTHER ELEVATION ABOVE GROUND AND NONE WERE SEEN TO FALL IF YOU PREFER TO BELIEVE THAT THE SNAKES HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE OR HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THAT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO CALL SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEM
3240-131232-0031 IN THE STREETS OF MEMPHIS JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHY THAT'S SENSIBLE THAT'S THE COMMON SENSE THAT HAS BEEN AGAINST US FROM THE FIRST IT IS NOT SAID WHETHER THE SNAKES WERE OF A KNOWN SPECIES OR NOT
3240-131232-0032 AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE STREETS CRAWLING LOOSE OR IN THICK TANGLED MASSES IN THE FIRST PLACE IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT THESE SNAKES HAD BEEN RAISED FROM SOME OTHER PART OF THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN A WHIRLWIND IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT A WHIRLWIND COULD SEGREGATE THEM
3240-131232-0033 STONES FENCE RAILS LIMBS OF TREES SAY THAT THE SNAKES OCCUPIED THE NEXT GRADATION AND WOULD BE THE NEXT TO FALL
3240-131232-0034 AGAIN OURS IS THE OBJECTION AGAINST SUCH SELECTIVENESS BY A WHIRLWIND CONCEIVABLY A WHIRLWIND COULD SCOOP OUT A DEN OF HIBERNATING SNAKES WITH STONES AND EARTH AND AN INFINITUDE OF OTHER DEBRIS SNATCHING UP DOZENS OF SNAKES
3240-131232-0035 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TO A DEN HUNDREDS MAYBE BUT ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THIS OCCURRENCE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM ALIVE FROM ONE FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN LENGTH
3240-131232-0036 RECORDS THE FALL AND SAYS THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM THE USUAL WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION IS GIVEN BUT IN WHAT LOCALITY SNAKES EXIST IN SUCH ABUNDANCE IS YET A MYSTERY THIS MATTER OF ENORMOUSNESS OF NUMBERS
3240-131232-0037 SUGGESTS TO ME SOMETHING OF A MIGRATORY NATURE BUT THAT SNAKES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT MIGRATE IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IF EVER AS TO FALLS OR FLUTTERINGS OF WINGED INSECTS FROM THE SKY PREVAILING NOTIONS OF SWARMING WOULD SEEM EXPLANATORY ENOUGH
3240-131232-0038 FALL OF FISHES JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN HOLLAND ANTS AUGUST FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE STRASBOURG LITTLE TOADS AUGUST SECOND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE SAVOY
3240-131232-0039 FALL OF ANTS CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR SOME WERE WINGLESS
3240-131232-0040 ENORMOUS FALL OF ANTS NANCY FRANCE JULY TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MOST OF THEM WERE WINGLESS
328-129766-0000 AND SO MIGHT MARRY AGAIN WHEN HE WOULD
328-129766-0001 AND TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT ME AS LONG AS I LIVED AND THAT IF HE DIED BEFORE ME HE WOULD LEAVE SUFFICIENT TO HIS MOTHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME STILL IN THE NAME OF A SISTER AND HE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS CAREFUL OF ME WHEN HE HEARD OF ME
328-129766-0002 AS YOU SHALL HEAR IN ITS TIME I CAME AWAY FOR ENGLAND IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST AFTER I HAD BEEN EIGHT YEARS IN THAT COUNTRY AND NOW A NEW SCENE OF MISFORTUNES ATTENDED ME WHICH PERHAPS FEW WOMEN HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LIFE OF
328-129766-0003 WE HAD AN INDIFFERENT GOOD VOYAGE TILL WE CAME JUST UPON THE COAST OF ENGLAND AND WHERE WE ARRIVED IN TWO AND THIRTY DAYS BUT WERE THEN RUFFLED WITH TWO OR THREE STORMS
328-129766-0004 GOT SOME REFRESHMENT ON SHORE AND PUT TO SEA AGAIN THOUGH WE MET WITH VERY BAD WEATHER AGAIN IN WHICH THE SHIP SPRUNG HER MAINMAST AS THEY CALLED IT FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT THEY MEANT BUT WE GOT AT LAST INTO MILFORD HAVEN IN WALES
328-129766-0005 WHERE THOUGH IT WAS REMOTE FROM OUR PORT
328-129766-0006 THE ISLE OF BRITAIN I RESOLVED TO VENTURE IT NO MORE UPON THE WATERS WHICH HAD BEEN SO TERRIBLE TO ME SO GETTING MY CLOTHES AND MONEY ON SHORE WITH MY BILLS OF LOADING AND OTHER PAPERS I RESOLVED TO COME FOR LONDON
328-129766-0007 THE PORT WHITHER SHE WAS BOUND WAS TO BRISTOL WHERE MY BROTHER'S CHIEF CORRESPONDENT LIVED I GOT TO LONDON IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS WHERE I HEARD A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THAT THE SHIP WAS ARRIVED IN BRISTOL
328-129766-0008 THE BREAKING OF HER MAINMAST SHE HAD GREAT DAMAGE ON BOARD AND THAT A GREAT PART OF HER CARGO WAS SPOILED I HAD NOW A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UPON MY HANDS AND A DREADFUL APPEARANCE IT HAD I WAS COME AWAY WITH A KIND OF FINAL FAREWELL
328-129766-0009 WHAT I BROUGHT WITH ME WAS INDEED CONSIDERABLE HAD IT COME SAFE AND BY THE HELP OF IT I MIGHT HAVE MARRIED AGAIN TOLERABLY WELL BUT AS IT WAS I WAS REDUCED TO BETWEEN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN THE WHOLE AND THIS WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF RECRUIT
328-129766-0010 I WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT FRIENDS NAY EVEN SO MUCH AS WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCE
328-129766-0011 THAT SET ME UP FORMERLY FOR A FORTUNE SHE WAS DEAD AND HER HUSBAND ALSO AS I WAS INFORMED UPON SENDING A PERSON UNKNOWN TO INQUIRE THE LOOKING AFTER MY CARGO OF GOODS SOON AFTER OBLIGED ME TO TAKE A JOURNEY TO BRISTOL AND DURING MY ATTENDANCE UPON THAT AFFAIR
328-129766-0012 I TOOK THE DIVERSION OF GOING TO THE BATH FOR AS I WAS STILL FAR FROM BEING OLD SO MY HUMOUR WHICH WAS ALWAYS GAY CONTINUED SO TO AN EXTREME AND BEING NOW AS IT WERE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE THOUGH I WAS A WOMAN WITHOUT A FORTUNE
328-129766-0013 AS HAD BEEN MY CASE BEFORE THE BATH IS A PLACE OF GALLANTRY ENOUGH EXPENSIVE AND FULL OF SNARES I WENT THITHER INDEED
328-129766-0014 BUT I MUST DO MYSELF JUSTICE AS TO PROTEST I KNEW NOTHING AMISS I MEANT NOTHING BUT IN AN HONEST WAY NOR HAD I ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT ME AT FIRST THAT LOOKED THE WAY WHICH AFTERWARDS I SUFFERED THEM TO BE GUIDED
328-129766-0015 AS IT IS CALLED THERE AND CONTRACTED SOME UNHAPPY ACQUAINTANCES WHICH RATHER PROMPTED THE FOLLIES I FELL AFTERWARDS INTO THAN FORTIFIED ME AGAINST THEM I LIVED PLEASANTLY ENOUGH KEPT GOOD COMPANY THAT IS TO SAY GAY FINE COMPANY
328-129766-0016 BUT HAD THE DISCOURAGEMENT TO FIND THIS WAY OF LIVING SUNK ME EXCEEDINGLY AND THAT AS I HAD NO SETTLED INCOME SO SPENDING UPON THE MAIN STOCK WAS BUT A CERTAIN KIND OF BLEEDING TO DEATH AND THIS GAVE ME MANY SAD REFLECTIONS IN THE INTERVAL OF MY OTHER THOUGHTS
328-129766-0017 HOWEVER I SHOOK THEM OFF
328-129766-0018 BUT I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR IT I WAS NOT NOW AT REDRIFF WHERE IF I HAD SET MYSELF TOLERABLY UP SOME HONEST SEA CAPTAIN OR OTHER MIGHT HAVE TALKED WITH ME UPON THE HONOURABLE TERMS OF MATRIMONY BUT I WAS AT THE BATH
328-129766-0019 WHERE MEN FIND A MISTRESS SOMETIMES BUT VERY RARELY LOOK FOR A WIFE AND CONSEQUENTLY ALL THE PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCES A WOMAN CAN EXPECT TO MAKE THERE MUST HAVE SOME TENDENCY THAT WAY I HAD SPENT THE FIRST SEASON WELL ENOUGH
328-129766-0020 FOR THOUGH I HAD CONTRACTED SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO CAME TO THE BATH FOR HIS DIVERSION
328-129766-0021 AS IT MIGHT BE CALLED I HAD RESISTED SOME CASUAL OFFERS OF GALLANTRY AND HAD MANAGED THAT WAY WELL ENOUGH I WAS NOT WICKED ENOUGH TO COME INTO THE CRIME FOR THE MERE VICE OF IT AND I HAD NO EXTRAORDINARY OFFERS MADE ME THAT TEMPTED ME WITH THE MAIN THING WHICH I WANTED
328-129766-0022 I CONTRACTED AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED WHO THOUGH SHE DID NOT KEEP AN ILL HOUSE AS WE CALL IT YET HAD NONE OF THE BEST PRINCIPLES IN HERSELF I HAD ON ALL OCCASIONS BEHAVED MYSELF SO WELL
328-129766-0023 AS NOT TO GET THE LEAST SLUR UPON MY REPUTATION ON ANY ACCOUNT WHATEVER AND ALL THE MEN THAT I HAD CONVERSED WITH WERE OF SO GOOD REPUTATION THAT I HAD NOT GIVEN THE LEAST REFLECTION BY CONVERSING WITH THEM
328-129766-0024 FOR A WICKED CORRESPONDENCE IF THEY HAD ANY OF THEM OFFERED IT YET THERE WAS ONE GENTLEMAN AS ABOVE WHO ALWAYS SINGLED ME OUT FOR THE DIVERSION OF MY COMPANY AS HE CALLED IT WHICH AS HE WAS PLEASED TO SAY WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HIM BUT AT THAT TIME
328-129766-0025 THERE WAS NO MORE IN IT I HAD MANY MELANCHOLY HOURS AT THE BATH AFTER THE COMPANY WAS GONE
328-129766-0026 AND FOR RECRUITS OF MONEY YET I CHOSE TO COME BACK TO BATH FOR MY RESIDENCE BECAUSE BEING ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED IN THE SUMMER I FOUND THAT DURING THE WINTER I LIVED RATHER CHEAPER THERE
328-129766-0027 HERE I SAY I PASSED THE WINTER AS HEAVILY AS I HAD PASSED THE AUTUMN CHEERFULLY
328-129766-0028 OF WHAT LAY HARDEST UPON MY MIND AND PARTICULARLY THE NARROWNESS OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE LOSS OF MY FORTUNE BY THE DAMAGE OF MY GOODS AT SEA I TOLD HER ALSO THAT I HAD A MOTHER AND A BROTHER IN VIRGINIA IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0029 AND AS I HAD REALLY WRITTEN BACK TO MY MOTHER IN PARTICULAR TO REPRESENT MY CONDITION AND THE GREAT LOSS I HAD RECEIVED
328-129766-0030 SO I DID NOT FAIL TO LET MY NEW FRIEND KNOW THAT I EXPECTED A SUPPLY FROM THENCE AND SO INDEED I DID AND AS THE SHIPS WENT FROM BRISTOL TO YORK RIVER IN VIRGINIA AND BACK AGAIN GENERALLY IN LESS TIME FROM LONDON
328-129766-0031 AND THAT MY BROTHER CORRESPONDED CHIEFLY AT BRISTOL I THOUGHT IT WAS MUCH BETTER FOR ME TO WAIT HERE FOR MY RETURNS THAN TO GO TO LONDON WHERE ALSO I HAD NOT THE LEAST ACQUAINTANCE MY NEW FRIEND APPEARED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH MY CONDITION
328-129766-0032 AND INDEED WAS SO VERY KIND AS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF MY LIVING WITH HER TO SO LOW A PRICE DURING THE WINTER THAT SHE CONVINCED ME SHE GOT NOTHING BY ME AND AS FOR LODGING DURING THE WINTER I PAID NOTHING AT ALL
328-129766-0033 TILL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO DO OTHERWISE SHE HAD SOME PERSONS OF CHARACTER THAT FREQUENTLY LODGED IN HER HOUSE AND IN PARTICULAR THE GENTLEMAN WHO AS I SAID SINGLED ME OUT FOR HIS COMPANION
328-129766-0034 THE WINTER BEFORE AND HE CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN HIS COMPANY AND TWO SERVANTS AND LODGED IN THE SAME HOUSE
328-129766-0035 LETTING HIM KNOW THAT I WAS STILL WITH HER BUT SHE DENIED IT AND PROTESTED TO ME THAT SHE DID NOT AND HE SAID THE SAME IN A WORD THIS GENTLEMAN CAME DOWN AND CONTINUED TO SINGLE ME OUT FOR HIS PECULIAR CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS CONVERSATION
328-129766-0036 IF I MIGHT BELIEVE HIM WAS TO HIM
328-129766-0037 AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
328-129766-0038 AND THAT I WAITED AT BATH TILL THE NEXT VIRGINIA FLEET SHOULD ARRIVE BY WHICH I EXPECTED CONSIDERABLE EFFECTS I UNDERSTOOD BY HIM AND BY OTHERS OF HIM THAT HE HAD A WIFE BUT THAT THE LADY WAS DISTEMPERED IN HER HEAD AND WAS UNDER THE CONDUCT
328-129766-0039 OF HER OWN RELATIONS WHICH HE CONSENTED TO TO AVOID ANY REFLECTIONS THAT MIGHT AS WAS NOT UNUSUAL IN SUCH CASES BE CAST ON HIM FOR MISMANAGING HER CURE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE CAME TO THE BATH TO DIVERT HIS THOUGHTS
328-129766-0040 FROM THE DISTURBANCE OF SUCH A MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE AS THAT WAS MY LANDLADY WHO OF HER OWN ACCORD ENCOURAGED THE CORRESPONDENCE ON ALL OCCASIONS GAVE ME AN ADVANTAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HIM
328-129766-0041 AS A MAN OF HONOUR AND OF VIRTUE AS WELL AS OF GREAT ESTATE AND INDEED I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF REASON TO SAY SO OF HIM TOO FOR THOUGH WE LODGED BOTH ON A FLOOR AND HE HAD FREQUENTLY COME INTO MY CHAMBER EVEN WHEN I WAS IN BED
328-129766-0042 AND I ALSO INTO HIS WHEN HE WAS IN BED YET HE NEVER OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME FURTHER THAN A KISS OR SO MUCH AS SOLICITED ME TO ANYTHING TILL LONG AFTER AS YOU SHALL HEAR
328-129766-0043 AND SHE AGAIN USED TO TELL ME SHE BELIEVED IT WAS SO FROM THE BEGINNING HOWEVER SHE USED TO TELL ME THAT SHE THOUGHT I OUGHT TO EXPECT SOME GRATIFICATION FROM HIM FOR MY COMPANY FOR INDEED HE DID AS IT WERE ENGROSS ME AND I WAS SELDOM FROM HIM
328-129766-0044 I TOLD HER I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM THE LEAST OCCASION TO THINK I WANTED IT
328-129766-0045 AND SHE DID SO AND MANAGED IT SO DEXTEROUSLY
328-129766-0046 AND SO I PUT OFF ALL ROOM FOR ANY OFFER FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ATTACKED ME AGAIN
328-129766-0047 WHICH HE WAS SORRY FOR ASSURING ME THAT HE INQUIRED INTO IT WITH NO DESIGN TO SATISFY HIS OWN CURIOSITY BUT MERELY TO ASSIST ME IF THERE WAS ANY OCCASION BUT SINCE I
328-129766-0048 IN NEED OF ANY ASSISTANCE HE HAD BUT ONE THING MORE TO DESIRE OF ME AND THAT WAS THAT I WOULD PROMISE HIM THAT WHEN I WAS ANY WAY STRAITENED OR LIKE TO BE SO I WOULD FRANKLY TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I WOULD MAKE USE OF HIM WITH THE SAME FREEDOM THAT HE MADE THE OFFER
328-129766-0049 ADDING THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS FIND I HAD A TRUE FRIEND THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS AFRAID TO TRUST HIM I OMITTED NOTHING THAT WAS FIT TO BE SAID BY ONE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I HAD A DUE SENSE OF HIS KINDNESS
328-129766-0050 AND INDEED FROM THAT TIME I DID NOT APPEAR SO MUCH RESERVED TO HIM AS I HAD DONE BEFORE THOUGH STILL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE STRICTEST VIRTUE ON BOTH SIDES BUT HOW FREE SOEVER OUR CONVERSATION WAS I COULD NOT ARRIVE TO THAT SORT OF FREEDOM
328-129766-0051 THOUGH I WAS SECRETLY VERY GLAD OF HIS OFFER SOME WEEKS PASSED AFTER THIS AND STILL I NEVER ASKED HIM FOR MONEY WHEN MY LANDLADY A CUNNING CREATURE WHO HAD OFTEN PRESSED ME TO IT BUT FOUND THAT I COULD NOT DO IT
328-129766-0052 MAKES A STORY OF HER OWN INVENTING AND COMES IN
328-129766-0053 OH WIDOW SAYS SHE I HAVE BAD NEWS TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING WHAT IS THAT SAID I ARE THE VIRGINIA SHIPS TAKEN BY THE FRENCH FOR THAT WAS MY FEAR NO NO SAYS SHE
328-129766-0054 BUT THE MAN YOU SENT TO BRISTOL YESTERDAY FOR MONEY IS COME BACK AND SAYS HE HAS BROUGHT NONE NOW I COULD BY NO MEANS LIKE HER PROJECT
328-129766-0055 WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT WANT AND I CLEARLY SAW THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY BEING BACKWARD TO ASK SO I TOOK HER UP SHORT
328-129766-0056 SAID I FOR I ASSURE YOU HE BROUGHT ME ALL THE MONEY I SENT HIM FOR AND HERE IT IS SAID I PULLING OUT MY PURSE WITH ABOUT TWELVE GUINEAS IN IT AND ADDED I INTEND YOU SHALL HAVE MOST OF IT BY AND BY HE SEEMED DISTASTED A LITTLE AT HER TALKING
328-129766-0057 AS SHE DID AT FIRST AS WELL AS I TAKING IT AS I FANCIED HE WOULD AS SOMETHING FORWARD OF HER BUT WHEN HE SAW ME GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER HE CAME IMMEDIATELY TO HIMSELF AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING WE TALKED OF IT AGAIN WHEN I FOUND HE WAS FULLY SATISFIED
328-129766-0058 AND SMILING SAID HE HOPED I WOULD NOT WANT MONEY AND NOT TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I HAD PROMISED HIM OTHERWISE I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED AT MY LANDLADY'S TALKING SO PUBLICLY THE DAY BEFORE OF WHAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
328-129766-0059 BUT I SUPPOSED SHE WANTED WHAT I OWED HER WHICH WAS ABOUT EIGHT GUINEAS WHICH I HAD RESOLVED TO GIVE HER AND HAD ACCORDINGLY
328-129766-0060 HE WAS IN A MIGHT GOOD HUMOUR WHEN HE HEARD ME SAY I HAD PAID HER AND IT WENT OFF INTO SOME OTHER DISCOURSE AT THAT TIME BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE HAVING HEARD ME UP ABOUT MY ROOM BEFORE HIM HE CALLED TO ME AND I ANSWERING HE ASKED ME TO COME INTO HIS CHAMBER
328-129766-0061 FOR HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME WHICH WAS OF SOME MOMENT AFTER SOME VERY KIND EXPRESSIONS HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE VERY HONEST TO HIM AND GIVE A SINCERE ANSWER TO ONE THING HE WOULD DESIRE OF ME
328-129766-0062 AT THE WORD SINCERE AND ASKING HIM IF I HAD EVER GIVEN HIM ANY ANSWERS WHICH WERE NOT SINCERE I PROMISED HIM I WOULD WHY THEN HIS REQUEST WAS HE SAID TO LET HIM SEE MY PURSE
328-129766-0063 I IMMEDIATELY PUT MY HAND INTO MY POCKET AND LAUGHING TO HIM PULLED IT OUT AND THERE WAS IN IT THREE GUINEAS AND A HALF
328-129766-0064 NOT BY A GREAT DEAL WELL THEN HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE ME PROMISE TO GO AND FETCH HIM ALL THE MONEY I HAD EVERY FARTHING I TOLD HIM I WOULD AND I WENT INTO MY CHAMBER AND FETCHED HIM A LITTLE PRIVATE DRAWER
328-129766-0065 WHERE I HAD ABOUT SIX GUINEAS MORE AND SOME SILVER AND THREW IT ALL DOWN UPON THE BED AND TOLD HIM THERE WAS ALL MY WEALTH HONESTLY TO A SHILLING HE LOOKED A LITTLE AT IT BUT DID NOT TELL IT
328-129766-0066 AND THEN REACHING HIS POCKET PULLED OUT A KEY AND BADE ME OPEN A LITTLE WALNUT TREE BOX HE HAD UPON THE TABLE AND BRING HIM SUCH A DRAWER WHICH I DID IN WHICH DRAWER THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN GOLD I BELIEVE NEAR TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
328-129766-0067 BUT I KNEW NOT HOW MUCH HE TOOK THE DRAWER AND TAKING MY HAND MADE ME PUT IT IN AND TAKE A WHOLE HANDFUL I WAS BACKWARD AT THAT BUT HE HELD MY HAND HARD IN HIS HAND
328-129766-0068 WHEN I HAD DONE SO HE MADE ME PUT THEM INTO MY LAP AND TOOK MY LITTLE DRAWER
328-129766-0069 AND CARRY IT ALL HOME INTO MY OWN CHAMBER I RELATE THIS STORY THE MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE GOOD HUMOUR THERE WAS IN IT AND TO SHOW THE TEMPER WITH WHICH WE CONVERSED
328-129766-0070 AND IN A WORD PRESSED ME TO BUY BETTER
328-129766-0071 FOR I LOVED NOTHING IN THE WORLD BETTER THAN FINE CLOTHES I TOLD HIM I MUST HOUSEWIFE THE MONEY HE HAD LENT ME OR ELSE I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY HIM AGAIN HE THEN TOLD ME IN A FEW WORDS THAT AS HE HAD A SINCERE RESPECT FOR ME AND KNEW MY CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0072 AND THAT HE THOUGHT I HAD MERITED IT FROM HIM BY GIVING HIM MY COMPANY SO ENTIRELY AS I HAD DONE AFTER THIS HE MADE ME TAKE A MAID AND KEEP HOUSE
328-129766-0073 WHICH I DID VERY WILLINGLY BELIEVING AS IT APPEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY IT NOR DID THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE FAIL TO FIND HER ACCOUNT IN IT TOO WE HAD LIVED THUS NEAR THREE MONTHS WHEN
328-129766-0074 THE COMPANY BEGINNING TO WEAR AWAY AT THE BATH HE TALKED OF GOING AWAY
328-129766-0075 I WAS NOT VERY EASY IN THAT PROPOSAL NOT KNOWING WHAT POSTURE I WAS TO LIVE IN THERE OR HOW HE MIGHT USE ME BUT WHILE THIS WAS IN DEBATE
328-129766-0076 CALLED SHEPTON WHERE HE HAD SOME BUSINESS AND WAS THERE TAKEN VERY ILL AND SO ILL THAT HE COULD NOT TRAVEL SO HE SENT HIS MAN BACK TO BATH TO BEG ME THAT I WOULD HIRE A COACH AND COME OVER TO HIM BEFORE HE WENT
328-129766-0077 HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS MONEY AND OTHER THINGS OF VALUE WITH ME AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM I DID NOT KNOW BUT I SECURED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD AND LOCKED UP THE LODGINGS AND WENT TO HIM WHERE I FOUND HIM VERY ILL INDEED HOWEVER I PERSUADED HIM TO BE CARRIED
328-129766-0078 IN A LITTER TO THE BATH WHERE THERE WAS MORE HELP AND BETTER ADVICE TO BE HAD HE CONSENTED AND I BROUGHT HIM TO THE BATH WHICH WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES AS I REMEMBER HERE HE CONTINUED VERY ILL OF A FEVER
328-129766-0079 AND KEPT HIS BED FIVE WEEKS ALL WHICH TIME I NURSED HIM AND TENDED HIM MYSELF
328-129766-0080 INDEED IF I HAD BEEN HIS WIFE I COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE I SAT UP WITH HIM SO MUCH AND SO OFTEN THAT AT LAST INDEED HE WOULD NOT LET ME SIT UP ANY LONGER AND THEN I GOT A PALLET BED INTO HIS ROOM AND LAY IN IT JUST AT HIS BED'S FEET
328-129766-0081 I WAS INDEED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH HIS CONDITION AND WITH THE APPREHENSION OF LOSING SUCH A FRIEND AS HE WAS AND WAS LIKE TO BE TO ME AND I USED TO SIT AND CRY BY HIM MANY HOURS TOGETHER
328-129766-0082 HOWEVER AT LAST HE GREW BETTER AND GAVE HOPES THAT HE WOULD RECOVER AS INDEED HE DID THOUGH VERY SLOWLY WERE IT OTHERWISE THAN WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY I SHOULD NOT BE BACKWARD TO DISCLOSE IT
328-129766-0083 AS IT IS APPARENT I HAVE DONE IN OTHER CASES IN THIS ACCOUNT BUT I AFFIRM THAT THROUGH ALL THIS CONVERSATION ABATING THE FREEDOM OF COMING INTO THE CHAMBER WHEN I OR HE WAS IN BED AND ABATING THE NECESSARY OFFICES
328-129766-0084 OF ATTENDING HIM NIGHT AND DAY WHEN HE WAS SICK THERE HAD NOT PASSED THE LEAST IMMODEST WORD OR ACTION BETWEEN US OH THAT IT HAD BEEN SO TO THE LAST AFTER SOME TIME HE GATHERED STRENGTH AND GREW WELL APACE
328-129766-0085 AND I WOULD HAVE REMOVED MY PALLET BED BUT HE WOULD NOT LET ME TILL HE WAS ABLE TO VENTURE HIMSELF WITHOUT ANYBODY TO SIT UP WITH HIM AND THEN I REMOVED TO MY OWN CHAMBER
328-129766-0086 AND WHEN HE GREW QUITE WELL HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF FIFTY GUINEAS FOR MY CARE AND AS HE CALLED IT FOR HAZARDING MY LIFE TO SAVE HIS AND NOW HE MADE DEEP PROTESTATIONS OF A SINCERE INVIOLABLE AFFECTION FOR ME
328-129766-0087 BUT ALL ALONG ATTESTED IT TO BE WITH THE UTMOST RESERVE FOR MY VIRTUE AND HIS OWN I TOLD HIM I WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF IT HE CARRIED IT THAT LENGTH THAT HE PROTESTED TO ME THAT IF HE WAS NAKED IN BED WITH ME
328-129766-0088 AS HE WOULD DEFEND IT IF I WAS ASSAULTED BY A RAVISHER I BELIEVED HIM AND TOLD HIM I DID SO BUT THIS DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WOULD HE SAID
328-129766-0089 WAS A GREAT WHILE AFTER THIS THAT I HAD OCCASION ON MY OWN BUSINESS TO GO TO BRISTOL UPON WHICH HE HIRED ME A COACH AND WOULD GO WITH ME AND DID SO AND NOW INDEED OUR INTIMACY INCREASED
328-129766-0090 TO HAVE NO LODGING IN THE INN BUT IN ONE LARGE CHAMBER WITH TWO BEDS IN IT
328-129766-0091 AND COMING INTO THAT ROOM SAID VERY FRANKLY TO HIM SIR IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE LADY BE YOUR SPOUSE OR NO
328-129766-0092 WHICH DREW QUITE ACROSS THE ROOM AND EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED THE BEDS WELL SAYS MY FRIEND VERY READILY THESE BEDS WILL DO AND AS FOR THE REST WE ARE TOO NEAR AKIN TO LIE TOGETHER THOUGH WE MAY LODGE NEAR ONE ANOTHER
328-129766-0093 HE DECENTLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TILL I WAS IN BED AND THEN WENT TO BED IN THE BED ON HIS OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT LAY THERE TALKING TO ME A GREAT WHILE AT LAST REPEATING HIS USUAL SAYING THAT HE COULD LIE NAKED IN THE BED WITH ME AND NOT OFFER ME THE LEAST INJURY
328-129766-0094 HE STARTS OUT OF HIS BED AND NOW MY DEAR SAYS HE YOU SHALL SEE HOW JUST I WILL BE TO YOU AND THAT I CAN KEEP MY WORD AND AWAY HE COMES TO MY BED I RESISTED A LITTLE BUT I MUST CONFESS I SHOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED HIM MUCH
328-129766-0095 IF HE HAD NOT MADE THOSE PROMISES AT ALL SO AFTER A LITTLE STRUGGLE AS I SAID I LAY STILL AND LET HIM COME TO BED WHEN HE WAS THERE HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND SO I LAY ALL NIGHT WITH HIM BUT HE HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH ME OR OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME
328-129766-0096 OTHER THAN EMBRACING ME AS I SAY IN HIS ARMS NO NOT THE WHOLE NIGHT BUT ROSE UP AND DRESSED HIM IN THE MORNING AND LEFT ME AS INNOCENT FOR HIM AS I WAS THE DAY I WAS BORN THIS WAS A SURPRISING THING TO ME
328-129766-0097 AND PERHAPS MAY BE SO TO OTHERS WHO KNOW HOW THE LAWS OF NATURE WORK FOR HE WAS A STRONG VIGOROUS BRISK PERSON NOR DID HE ACT THUS ON A PRINCIPLE OF RELIGION AT ALL BUT OF MERE AFFECTION INSISTING ON IT
328-129766-0098 THAT THOUGH I WAS TO HIM TO MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN IN THE WORLD YET BECAUSE HE LOVED ME HE COULD NOT INJURE ME
332-128985-0000 WE WILL PASS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REGULAR OUT AND OUT PIRATE ONE FROM WHOSE MAST HEAD WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE BLACK FLAG WITH ITS SKULL AND CROSS BONES IF THAT EMBLEMATIC PIECE OF BUNTING HAD BEEN IN USE BY THE PIRATES OF THE PERIOD
332-128985-0001 AND HIS OWN WAS UNKNOWN AND THE BRAZILIAN BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN BRAZIL THOUGH OF DUTCH PARENTS UNLIKE MOST OF HIS FELLOW PRACTITIONERS HE DID NOT GRADUALLY BECOME A PIRATE FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH
332-128985-0002 HE NEVER HAD AN INTENTION OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE AS SOON AS HE GREW TO BE A MAN HE BECAME A BLOODY BUCCANEER AND AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY HE JOINED A PIRATE CREW AND HAD MADE BUT A FEW VOYAGES WHEN IT WAS PERCEIVED BY HIS COMPANIONS
332-128985-0003 THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGES
332-128985-0004 HE FELL IN WITH A SPANISH SHIP LOADED WITH SILVER BULLION HAVING CAPTURED THIS HE SAILED WITH HIS PRIZE TO JAMAICA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GREAT RESORTS OF THE ENGLISH BUCCANEERS THERE HIS SUCCESS DELIGHTED THE COMMUNITY
332-128985-0005 HIS TALENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF GREAT PIRATICAL OPERATIONS SOON BECAME APPARENT AND HE WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE HEAD PIRATE OF THE WEST INDIES HE WAS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A HERO EVEN BY THOSE COLONISTS
332-128985-0006 WHO HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH PIRATES AND AS FOR ESQUEMELING HE SIMPLY WORSHIPPED THE GREAT BRAZILIAN DESPERADO IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT JULIUS CAESAR OR MISTER GLADSTONE
332-128985-0007 HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC IN HIS PRAISES AND AS IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS THE ROC IS DESCRIBED AS THE GREATEST OF BIRDS SO IN THE EYES OF THE BUCCANEER BIOGRAPHER THIS ROC WAS THE GREATEST OF PIRATES
332-128985-0008 THAT ROC NOW BECAME FAMOUS THE BETTER HE BECAME KNOWN THE MORE GENERAL WAS THE FEAR AND RESPECT FELT FOR HIM AND WE ARE TOLD THAT THE MOTHERS OF THE ISLANDS USED TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO SLEEP BY THREATENING THEM WITH THE TERRIBLE ROC IF THEY DID NOT CLOSE THEIR EYES
332-128985-0009 THIS STORY HOWEVER I REGARD WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DOUBT
332-128985-0010 BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS AN EASY THING TO FRIGHTEN A CHILD INTO GOING TO SLEEP IF I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A YOUNGSTER TAKE A NAP I SHOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN CUBA OR OF THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE ARMENIANS
332-128985-0011 THIS RENOWNED PIRATE FROM BRAZIL MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE FELLOW TO LOOK AT HE WAS STRONG AND BRAWNY HIS FACE WAS SHORT AND VERY WIDE WITH HIGH CHEEK BONES AND HIS EXPRESSION PROBABLY RESEMBLED THAT OF A PUG DOG
332-128985-0012 HIS EYEBROWS WERE ENORMOUSLY LARGE AND BUSHY AND FROM UNDER THEM HE GLARED AT HIS MUNDANE SURROUNDINGS HE WAS NOT A MAN WHOSE SPIRIT COULD BE QUELLED BY LOOKING HIM STEADFASTLY IN THE EYE IT WAS HIS CUSTOM IN THE DAYTIME TO WALK ABOUT
332-128985-0013 CARRYING A DRAWN CUTLASS RESTING EASILY UPON HIS ARM EDGE UP VERY MUCH AS A FINE GENTLEMAN CARRIES HIS HIGH SILK HAT AND ANY ONE WHO SHOULD IMPERTINENTLY STARE OR ENDEAVOR TO QUELL HIS HIGH SPIRITS IN ANY OTHER WAY
332-128985-0014 WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
332-128985-0015 BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO STRICT AND EXACTING DURING THE BUSINESS SESSIONS OF HIS PIRATICAL YEAR BY WHICH I MEAN WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND AFTER PRIZES HE WAS VERY MUCH MORE DISAGREEABLE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A VACATION
332-128985-0016 ON HIS RETURN TO JAMAICA AFTER ONE OF HIS EXPEDITIONS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GIVE HIMSELF SOME RELAXATION AFTER THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO ROC TO GET HIMSELF THOROUGHLY DRUNK
332-128985-0017 WITH HIS CUTLASS WAVING HIGH IN THE AIR HE WOULD RUSH OUT INTO THE STREET AND TAKE A WHACK AT EVERY ONE WHOM HE MET AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE THE CITIZENS ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE THE STREET TO HIMSELF AND IT WAS NOT AT ALL LIKELY
332-128985-0018 THAT HIS VISITS TO JAMAICA WERE LOOKED FORWARD TO WITH ANY EAGER ANTICIPATIONS ROC IT MAY BE SAID WAS NOT ONLY A BLOODY PIRATE BUT A BLOODED ONE HE WAS THOROUGHBRED
332-128985-0019 FROM THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSERT HIS INDIVIDUALITY HE HAD BEEN A PIRATE AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EVER REFORM HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING ELSE THERE WERE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CASE
332-128985-0020 IN HIS NATURE THERE WAS NO ALLOY NOR MODERATION NOR FORBEARANCE THE APPRECIATIVE ESQUEMELING WHO MIGHT BE CALLED THE BOSWELL OF THE BUCCANEERS COULD NEVER HAVE MET HIS HERO ROC
332-128985-0021 WHEN THAT BUSHY BEARDED PIRATE WAS RUNNING AMUCK IN THE STREETS BUT IF HE HAD IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HE ASSURES US THAT WHEN ROC WAS NOT DRUNK HE WAS ESTEEMED BUT AT THE SAME TIME FEARED
332-128985-0022 BUT THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF GAINING ESTEEM AND ROC'S METHOD CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED VERY WELL IN THE CASE OF HIS LITERARY ASSOCIATE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE HATRED OF THE SPANIARDS BY THE BUCCANEERS BEGAN VERY EARLY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WEST INDIES
332-128985-0023 BUT IN ALL THE INSTANCES OF FEROCIOUS ENMITY TOWARD THE SPANIARDS THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING TO EQUAL THE FEELINGS OF ROC THE BRAZILIAN UPON THAT SUBJECT HIS DISLIKE TO EVERYTHING SPANISH AROSE HE DECLARED
332-128985-0024 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO BAD FOR A SPANIARD THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE WAS TO WAGE BITTER WAR AGAINST SPANISH SHIPS AND SPANISH SETTLEMENTS HE SELDOM GAVE ANY QUARTER TO HIS PRISONERS
332-128985-0025 THEN THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO BUT TO GO ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS AND PUT OUT TO SEA IN SEARCH OF SOME FRESH PRIZE SO FAR ROC'S CAREER HAD BEEN VERY MUCH LIKE THAT OF MANY OTHER COMPANIONS OF THE COAST
332-128985-0026 DIFFERING FROM THEM ONLY IN RESPECT TO INTENSITY AND FORCE BUT HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WITH IDEAS
332-128985-0027 HE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURING
332-128985-0028 AND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE ANY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE BAY WHICH WERE WELL LADEN AND WHICH WERE LIKELY SOON TO COME OUT SO WITH A SMALL BOAT FILLED WITH SOME OF HIS TRUSTY MEN HE ROWED QUIETLY INTO THE PORT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD DISCOVER
332-128985-0029 AND HAD SENT THAT MILD MANNERED OBSERVER INTO THE HARBOR TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
332-128985-0030 BUT HE CHOSE TO GO HIMSELF AND HE CAME TO GRIEF NO SOONER DID THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIPS LYING IN THE HARBOR BEHOLD A BOAT APPROACHING WITH A BIG BROWED BROAD JAWED MARINER SITTING IN THE STERN
332-128985-0031 AND WITH A GOOD MANY MORE BROAD BACKED HAIRY MARINERS THAN WERE NECESSARY PULLING AT THE OARS THAN THEY GAVE THE ALARM
332-128985-0032 ROC MUST HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN POWERS OR PERHAPS HE RELIED SOMEWHAT UPON THE FEAR WHICH HIS VERY PRESENCE EVOKED BUT HE MADE A MISTAKE THIS TIME HE HAD RUN INTO THE LION'S JAW AND THE LION HAD CLOSED HIS TEETH UPON HIM
332-128985-0033 WHEN THE PIRATE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF PUTTING THEM TO TRIAL BUCCANEERS WERE OUTLAWED BY THE SPANISH
332-128985-0034 AND WERE CONSIDERED AS WILD BEASTS TO BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WHEREVER CAUGHT CONSEQUENTLY ROC AND HIS MEN WERE THROWN INTO A DUNGEON AND CONDEMNED TO BE EXECUTED IF HOWEVER THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIMSELF
332-128985-0035 DURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATES
332-128985-0036 THIS WAS A BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH A CAPABLE PIRATE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PROFICIENT IF HE COULD NOT GET HIMSELF OUT OF SCRAPES HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CUTTING DOWN SENTINELS
332-128985-0037 OR JUMPING OVERBOARD WITH A COUPLE OF WINE JARS FOR A LIFE PRESERVER OR OF DOING ANY OF THOSE ORDINARY THINGS WHICH PIRATES WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHEN ESCAPING FROM THEIR CAPTORS
332-128985-0038 INSIDE OF A FORTRESS AND IF THEY ESCAPED FROM THIS THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF A BODY OF SPANISH SOLDIERS THEIR STOUT ARMS AND THEIR STOUT HEARTS WERE OF NO USE TO THEM NOW
332-128985-0039 AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVE
332-128985-0040 WHO CAME IN TO BRING HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND BY THE MEANS OF THIS MAN THE PIRATE HOPED TO PLAY A TRICK UPON THE GOVERNOR HE PROMISED THE SLAVE THAT IF HE WOULD HELP HIM AND HE TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO SO
332-128985-0041 HE WOULD GIVE HIM MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY HIS FREEDOM AND TO RETURN TO HIS FRIENDS AND THIS OF COURSE WAS A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO THE POOR FELLOW WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME THE SLAVE AGREED TO THE PROPOSALS
332-128985-0042 AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO BRING SOME WRITING MATERIALS TO ROC WHO THEREUPON BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF A LETTER
332-128985-0043 WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN
332-128985-0044 BY THE HAND OF ROC WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF ANY HARM SHOULD COME TO THESE BRAVE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AND IMPRISONED WHEN THEY WERE DOING NO HARM TO ANYBODY HE WOULD SWEAR IN HIS MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT NEVER
332-128985-0045 FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WOULD HE GIVE QUARTER TO ANY SPANIARD WHO MIGHT FALL INTO HIS HANDS AND HE MOREOVER THREATENED THAT ANY KIND OF VENGEANCE WHICH SHOULD BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THE BUCCANEERS AND FRENCH UNITED TO INFLICT UPON THE SPANISH SHIPS
332-128985-0046 OR UPON THE TOWN OF CAMPEACHY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER HE SHOULD HEAR OF ANY INJURY THAT MIGHT BE INFLICTED UPON THE UNFORTUNATE MEN WHO WERE THEN LYING IMPRISONED IN THE FORTRESS WHEN THE SLAVE CAME BACK TO ROC
332-128985-0047 THE LETTER WAS GIVEN TO HIM WITH VERY PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS AS TO WHAT HE WAS TO DO WITH IT HE WAS TO DISGUISE HIMSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND THEN IN THE NIGHT HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY OUT OF THE TOWN
332-128985-0048 AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS TO RETURN AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR WHEN HE WAS TO STATE THAT HE HAD BEEN PUT ON SHORE FROM THE FRENCH VESSEL IN THE OFFING WITH A LETTER WHICH HE WAS TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR THE SLAVE PERFORMED HIS PART OF THE BUSINESS VERY WELL
332-128985-0049 THE NEXT DAY WET AND BEDRAGGLED FROM MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEEDS AND MUD OF THE COAST HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE FORTRESS WITH HIS LETTER AND WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR NO ONE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A PERSON EMPLOYED ABOUT THE PLACE
332-128985-0050 HAVING FULFILLED HIS MISSION HE DEPARTED AND WHEN SEEN AGAIN HE WAS THE SAME SERVANT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO CARRY FOOD TO THE PRISONERS THE GOVERNOR READ THE LETTER WITH A DISQUIETED MIND
332-128985-0051 HE KNEW THAT THE FRENCH SHIP WHICH WAS LYING OUTSIDE THE HARBOR WAS A POWERFUL VESSEL AND HE DID NOT LIKE FRENCH SHIPS ANYWAY THE TOWN HAD ONCE BEEN TAKEN AND VERY BADLY TREATED BY A LITTLE FLEET OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUCCANEERS
332-128985-0052 AND HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO GREAT SPANISH FORCE IN THE HARBOR AT THAT TIME AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUCCANEERING VESSELS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER TOGETHER IN THE BAY
332-128985-0053 IF IT SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THAT THE GREAT PIRATE ROC HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH IN CAMPEACHY IT WAS AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A PRISONER TO HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FRIENDS SO NEAR BY AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK ROC'S CASE INTO MOST EARNEST CONSIDERATION
332-128985-0054 AND HE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE FELT HIMSELF IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO HAS STOLEN A BABY BEAR AND WHO HEARS THE ROAR OF AN APPROACHING PARENT THROUGH THE WOODS
332-128985-0055 TO THROW AWAY THE CUB AND WALK OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY BEARS IN THAT FOREST WOULD BE THE INCLINATION OF A MAN SO SITUATED AND TO GET RID OF THE GREAT PIRATE WITHOUT PROVOKING THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
332-128985-0056 WAS THE NATURAL INCLINATION OF THE GOVERNOR NOW ROC AND HIS MEN WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVING BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR WERE TOLD THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR HAVING COMMITTED NO OVERT ACT OF DISORDER THEY WOULD BE SET AT LIBERTY AND SHIPPED TO ENGLAND
332-128985-0057 UPON THE SINGLE CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD ABANDON PIRACY AND AGREE TO BECOME QUIET CITIZENS IN WHATEVER RESPECTABLE VOCATION THEY MIGHT SELECT TO THESE TERMS ROC AND HIS MEN AGREED WITHOUT ARGUMENT
332-128985-0058 THEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RETIRE FROM THE BUCCANEERING BUSINESS AND THAT NOTHING WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF CIVILIZATION AND VIRTUE THERE WAS A SHIP ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SPAIN AND ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GAVE ROC AND HIS MEN FREE PASSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN
332-128985-0059 THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OUR BUCCANEERS WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED TO HAVE BEEN PUT ON BOARD THE FRENCH VESSEL BUT AS THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD STARTED HIS PRISONERS ON THE ROAD TO REFORM HE DID NOT WISH TO THROW THEM INTO THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
332-128985-0060 BY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT
332-128985-0061 ON THE VOYAGE TO SPAIN ROC WAS ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO BEHAVE VERY WELL WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NO DOUBT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY DULL DAYS ON BOARD SHIP
332-128985-0062 WHEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO GAMBLE TO GET DRUNK AND TO RUN AMUCK UP AND DOWN THE DECK BUT HE CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM ALL THESE RECREATIONS AND SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE SUCH AN ABLE BODIED AND WILLING SAILOR
332-128985-0063 THAT THE CAPTAIN ALLOWED HIM TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE CREW ROC KNEW HOW TO DO A GREAT MANY THINGS NOT ONLY COULD HE MURDER AND ROB BUT HE KNEW HOW TO TURN AN HONEST PENNY WHEN THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF FILLING HIS PURSE HE HAD LEARNED AMONG THE INDIANS
332-128985-0064 HOW TO SHOOT FISH WITH BOW AND ARROWS AND ON THIS VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HE OCCUPIED ALL HIS SPARE TIME IN SITTING IN THE RIGGING AND SHOOTING THE FISH WHICH DISPORTED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE VESSEL
332-128985-0065 THESE FISH HE SOLD TO THE OFFICERS AND WE ARE TOLD THAT IN THIS WAY HE EARNED NO LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS PERHAPS THAT MANY DOLLARS IF THIS ACCOUNT IS TRUE FISH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY COSTLY IN THOSE DAYS
332-128985-0066 IN EVERY WAY ROC BEHAVED SO WELL THAT FOR HIS SAKE ALL HIS MEN WERE TREATED KINDLY AND ALLOWED MANY PRIVILEGES BUT WHEN THIS PARTY OF REFORMED PIRATES REACHED SPAIN AND WERE ALLOWED TO GO WHERE THEY PLEASED
332-128985-0067 THEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE OATHS THEY HAD TAKEN TO ABANDON PIRACY THAN THEY THOUGHT OF THE OATHS WHICH THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING RIGHT AND LEFT
332-128985-0068 BUT AS SOON AS THEY COULD MANAGE IT THEY SAILED BACK TO THE WEST INDIES AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN JAMAICA
332-128985-0069 NOT ONLY DID ROC CAST FROM HIM EVERY THOUGHT OF REFORMATION AND A RESPECTABLE LIFE BUT HE DETERMINED TO BEGIN THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY ON A GRANDER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE HE MADE A COMPACT WITH AN OLD FRENCH BUCCANEER
332-128985-0070 AND WITH A LARGE COMPANY OF BUCCANEERS HE ACTUALLY SET OUT TO TAKE A TOWN HAVING LOST EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND HAVING PASSED SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYMENT MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF SHOOTING FISH WITH A BOW AND ARROWS
332-128985-0071 OUR DOUGHTY PIRATE NOW DESIRED TO MAKE A GRAND STRIKE AND IF HE COULD TAKE A TOWN AND PILLAGE IT OF EVERYTHING VALUABLE IT CONTAINED HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD FORTUNE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND MIGHT RETIRE IF HE CHOSE
332-128985-0072 FROM THE ACTIVE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION
332-128985-0073 IN YUCATAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A BOLD AND RASH UNDERTAKING THE TWO PIRATES WERE BOLD AND RASH ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ROC HAD BEEN A PRISONER IN MERIDA AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOWN HE BELIEVED THAT HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS COULD LAND UPON THE COAST
332-128985-0074 IF THEY COULD DO THIS IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER TO RUSH UPON THE UNSUSPECTING GARRISON AND HAVING ANNIHILATED THESE MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE TOWN BUT THEIR PLANS DID NOT WORK VERY WELL THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY SOME INDIANS
332-128985-0075 AFTER THEY HAD LANDED WHO HURRIED TO MERIDA AND GAVE NOTICE OF THE APPROACH OF THE BUCCANEERS CONSEQUENTLY WHEN ROC AND HIS COMPANIONS REACHED THE TOWN THEY FOUND THE GARRISON PREPARED FOR THEM CANNONS LOADED AND ALL THE APPROACHES GUARDED
332-128985-0076 STILL THE PIRATES DID NOT HESITATE THEY ADVANCED FIERCELY TO THE ATTACK JUST AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE BOARDING A SPANISH VESSEL BUT THEY SOON FOUND THAT FIGHTING ON LAND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING AT SEA
332-128985-0077 IN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTED
332-128985-0078 AND THEY WERE THEREFORE GREATLY DISMAYED WHEN A PARTY OF HORSEMEN FROM THE TOWN WHO HAD MADE A WIDE DETOUR THROUGH THE WOODS SUDDENLY CHARGED UPON THEIR REAR
332-128985-0079 TRIBUTOR AND A GREAT MANY OF THE PIRATES WERE KILLED OR TAKEN AND ROC THE BRAZILIAN HAD A TERRIBLE FALL THIS MOST MEMORABLE FALL OCCURRED IN THE ESTIMATION OF JOHN ESQUEMELING
332-128985-0080 WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK ON MERIDA AND WHO WROTE THE ACCOUNT OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO BE CALLED UPON TO RECORD THAT HIS GREAT HERO ROC THE BRAZILIAN SAVED HIS LIFE AFTER THE UTTER DEFEAT OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONS
332-128985-0081 BY IGNOMINIOUSLY RUNNING AWAY THE LOYAL CHRONICLER HAD AS FIRM A BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE INABILITY OF HIS HERO TO FLY FROM DANGER AS WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTTISH DOUGLAS WHEN HE STOOD
332-128985-0082 COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
332-128985-0083 WHO WOULD EVEN SURRENDER TO SAY NOTHING OF RUNNING AWAY THAT ESQUEMELING COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT ROC HAD RETREATED FROM HIS ENEMIES DESERTED HIS FRIENDS AND TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS SO TRUCULENTLY PROCLAIMED
332-128985-0084 BUT THIS DOWNFALL OF A HERO SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ESQUEMELING ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PIRATICAL BODY AND WAS PROUD TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A BUCCANEER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF A PIRATE UNDER THE BRUTALITY
332-128985-0085 THE CRUELTY THE DISHONESTY AND THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE SEA ROBBERS OF THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS MEANNESS AND COWARDICE ROC AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SKETCH WAS A TYPICAL PIRATE
332-128985-0086 UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED HIMSELF TO HAVE ALL THOSE BRAVE AND SAVAGE QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING ESTEEMED AND REVERED AND UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED THOSE OTHER QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING DESPISED
332-128985-0087 BUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE TRUE CHARACTER OF A PIRATE THE HISTORIAN JOHN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH CUT UP BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS FAVORITE HERO HAD ROUNDED OFF HIS PIRATICAL CAREER
332-128985-0088 AND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLES
3486-166424-0000 AS I GAZED UPON THEM I WONDERED TO WHAT SECRET PLACE WITHIN THEIR BROODING IMMENSITIES THE LITTLE METAL MYSTERIES HAD FLED AND TO WHAT MYRIADS IT MIGHT BE OF THEIR KIND
3486-166424-0001 OF WHAT POWERS SMALL LIKE THESE OR OR QUICK ON THE SCREEN OF MY MIND FLASHED TWO PICTURES SIDE BY SIDE
3486-166424-0002 THE LITTLE FOUR RAYED PRINT IN THE GREAT DUST OF THE CRUMBLING RUIN AND ITS COLOSSAL TWIN ON THE BREAST OF THE POPPIED VALLEY I TURNED ASIDE CREPT THROUGH THE SHATTERED PORTAL AND LOOKED OVER THE HAUNTED HOLLOW UNBELIEVING I RUBBED MY EYES
3486-166424-0003 THEN LEAPED TO THE VERY BRIM OF THE BOWL A LARK HAD RISEN FROM THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE SHATTERED HEAPS AND HAD FLOWN CAROLING UP INTO THE SHADOWY SKY A FLOCK OF THE LITTLE WILLOW WARBLERS FLUNG THEMSELVES ACROSS THE VALLEY SCOLDING AND GOSSIPING
3486-166424-0004 A HARE SAT UPRIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANCIENT ROADWAY THE VALLEY ITSELF LAY SERENELY UNDER THE AMBERING LIGHT SMILING PEACEFUL EMPTIED OF HORROR
3486-166424-0005 I DROPPED OVER THE SIDE WALKED CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE ROAD UP WHICH BUT AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE WE HAD STRUGGLED SO DESPERATELY PACED FARTHER AND FARTHER WITH AN INCREASING CONFIDENCE AND A GROWING WONDER
3486-166424-0006 GONE WAS THAT SOUL OF LONELINESS VANISHED THE WHIRLPOOL OF DESPAIR THAT HAD STRIVEN TO DRAG US DOWN TO DEATH THE BOWL WAS NOTHING BUT A QUIET SMILING LOVELY LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE HILLS I LOOKED BACK
3486-166424-0007 EVEN THE RUINS HAD LOST THEIR SINISTER SHAPE WERE TIME WORN CRUMBLING PILES NOTHING MORE
3486-166424-0008 A RIFLE SHOT RANG OUT ABOVE US ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FROM THE PORTAL SCAMPERED CHIU MING HIS ROBE TUCKED UP ABOUT HIS KNEES THEY COME HE GASPED THEY COME
3486-166424-0009 DOWN IT WAS POURING AN AVALANCHE OF MEN I CAUGHT THE GLINT OF HELMETS AND CORSELETS THOSE IN THE VAN WERE MOUNTED GALLOPING TWO ABREAST UPON SURE FOOTED MOUNTAIN PONIES THEIR SHORT SWORDS LIFTED HIGH FLICKERED
3486-166424-0010 AFTER THE HORSEMEN SWARMED FOOT SOLDIERS A FOREST OF SHINING POINTS AND DULLY GLEAMING PIKES ABOVE THEM CLEARLY TO US CAME THEIR BATTLECRIES AGAIN VENTNOR'S RIFLE CRACKED ONE OF THE FOREMOST RIDERS WENT DOWN ANOTHER STUMBLED OVER HIM FELL
3486-166424-0011 THE RUSH WAS CHECKED FOR AN INSTANT MILLING UPON THE ROAD DICK I CRIED RUSH RUTH OVER TO THE TUNNEL MOUTH WE'LL FOLLOW WE CAN HOLD THEM THERE I'LL GET MARTIN CHIU MING AFTER THE PONY QUICK I PUSHED THE TWO OVER THE RIM OF THE HOLLOW
3486-166424-0012 QUICK MART I SHOUTED UP THE SHATTERED STAIRWAY WE CAN GET THROUGH THE HOLLOW RUTH AND DRAKE ARE ON THEIR WAY TO THE BREAK WE CAME THROUGH HURRY ALL RIGHT JUST A MINUTE HE CALLED I HEARD HIM EMPTY HIS MAGAZINE WITH ALMOST MACHINE GUN QUICKNESS
3486-166424-0013 ALL MY AMMUNITION IS ON HIM CHIU MING'S TAKING CARE OF THAT I GASPED WE DARTED OUT OF THE GATEWAY A GOOD FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY WERE RUTH AND DRAKE RUNNING STRAIGHT TO THE GREEN TUNNEL'S MOUTH BETWEEN THEM AND US WAS CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY
3486-166424-0014 AS WE SPED AFTER HIM I LOOKED BACK THE HORSEMEN HAD RECOVERED WERE NOW A SCANT HALF MILE FROM WHERE THE ROAD SWEPT PAST THE FORTRESS I SAW THAT WITH THEIR SWORDS THE HORSEMEN BORE GREAT BOWS A LITTLE CLOUD OF ARROWS SPARKLED FROM THEM
3486-166424-0015 FELL FAR SHORT DON'T LOOK BACK GRUNTED VENTNOR STRETCH YOURSELF WALTER THERE'S A SURPRISE COMING HOPE TO GOD I JUDGED THE TIME RIGHT WE TURNED OFF THE RUINED WAY
3486-166424-0016 HE REACHED OUT TOUCHED ME YOU'RE RIGHT WALTER HE GRINNED IT DOES SEEM LIKE CARRYING COALS TO NEWCASTLE
3486-166424-0017 SCATTERED PRONE AMONG THESE WERE MEN AND HORSES OTHERS STAGGERED SCREAMING ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF THIS STONY DIKE OUR PURSUERS WERE HELD LIKE RUSHING WATERS BEHIND A SUDDEN FALLEN TREE TIMED TO A SECOND CRIED VENTNOR HOLD EM FOR A WHILE
3486-166424-0018 AND HOLDING RUTH BY THE HAND RACE BACK TOWARD US EVEN AS HE TURNED THE VINE SCREENED ENTRANCE THROUGH WHICH WE HAD COME THROUGH WHICH WE HAD THOUGHT LAY SAFETY STREAMED OTHER ARMORED MEN WE WERE OUTFLANKED TO THE FISSURE SHOUTED VENTNOR
3486-166424-0019 DRAKE HEARD FOR HE CHANGED HIS COURSE TO THE CREVICE AT WHOSE MOUTH RUTH HAD SAID THE LITTLE THINGS HAD LAIN AFTER HIM STREAKED CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY SHOUTING OUT OF THE TUNNEL DOWN OVER THE LIP OF THE BOWL LEAPED THE SOLDIERS
3486-166424-0020 WE DROPPED UPON OUR KNEES SENT SHOT AFTER SHOT INTO THEM THEY FELL BACK HESITATED WE SPRANG UP SPED ON ALL TOO SHORT WAS THE CHECK BUT ONCE MORE WE HELD THEM AND AGAIN NOW RUTH AND DICK WERE A SCANT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE CREVICE I SAW HIM STOP
3486-166424-0021 PUSH HER FROM HIM TOWARD IT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NOW CHIU MING WAS WITH THEM RUTH SPRANG TO THE PONY LIFTED FROM ITS BACK A RIFLE THEN INTO THE MASS OF THEIR PURSUERS DRAKE AND SHE POURED A FUSILLADE THEY HUDDLED WAVERED BROKE FOR COVER
3486-166424-0022 A CHANCE GASPED VENTNOR BEHIND US WAS A WOLFLIKE YELPING THE FIRST PACK HAD RE FORMED HAD CROSSED THE BARRICADE THE DYNAMITE HAD MADE WAS RUSHING UPON US I RAN AS I HAD NEVER KNOWN I COULD
3486-166424-0023 OVER US WHINED THE BULLETS FROM THE COVERING GUNS CLOSE WERE WE NOW TO THE MOUTH OF THE FISSURE IF WE COULD BUT REACH IT CLOSE CLOSE WERE OUR PURSUERS TOO THE ARROWS CLOSER NO USE SAID VENTNOR
3486-166424-0024 NATURE'S SUMMONING OF EVERY RESERVE TO MEET THAT PERIL MY EYES TOOK THEM IN WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC NICETY THE LINKED MAIL LACQUERED BLUE AND SCARLET OF THE HORSEMEN BROWN PADDED ARMOR OF THE FOOTMEN
3486-166424-0025 THEIR BOWS AND JAVELINS AND SHORT BRONZE SWORDS THEIR PIKES AND SHIELDS AND UNDER THEIR ROUND HELMETS THEIR CRUEL BEARDED FACES WHITE AS OUR OWN WHERE THE BLACK BEARDS DID NOT COVER THEM THEIR FIERCE AND MOCKING EYES
3486-166424-0026 IN THIS WORLD OF OURS TWENTY CENTURIES BEYOND THEIR TIME SWIFTLY ACCURATELY EVEN AS I SCANNED THEM WE HAD BEEN DRILLING INTO THEM THEY ADVANCED DELIBERATELY HEEDLESS OF THEIR FALLEN THEIR ARROWS HAD CEASED TO FLY
3486-166424-0027 I WONDERED WHY FOR NOW WE WERE WELL WITHIN THEIR RANGE
3486-166424-0028 WE'VE SAVED RUTH ANYWAY HE SAID DRAKE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THAT HOLE IN THE WALL HE'S GOT LOTS OF AMMUNITION ON THE PONY BUT THEY'VE GOT US ANOTHER WILD SHOUTING DOWN SWEPT THE PACK
3486-166424-0029 WE LEAPED TO OUR FEET SENT OUR LAST BULLETS INTO THEM STOOD READY RIFLES CLUBBED TO MEET THE RUSH I HEARD RUTH SCREAM WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE ARMORED MEN WHY HAD THEY HALTED
3486-166424-0030 WHAT WAS IT AT WHICH THEY WERE GLARING OVER OUR HEADS AND WHY HAD THE RIFLE FIRE OF RUTH AND DRAKE CEASED SO ABRUPTLY SIMULTANEOUSLY WE TURNED WITHIN THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF THE FISSURE STOOD A SHAPE AN APPARITION
3486-166424-0031 A WOMAN BEAUTIFUL AWESOME INCREDIBLE SHE WAS TALL STANDING THERE SWATHED FROM CHIN TO FEET IN CLINGING VEILS OF PALE AMBER SHE SEEMED TALLER EVEN THAN TALL DRAKE
3486-166424-0032 YET IT WAS NOT HER HEIGHT THAT SENT THROUGH ME THE THRILL OF AWE OF HALF INCREDULOUS TERROR WHICH RELAXING MY GRIP LET MY SMOKING RIFLE DROP TO EARTH NOR WAS IT THAT ABOUT HER PROUD HEAD A CLOUD OF SHINING TRESSES SWIRLED AND PENNONED
3486-166424-0033 LIKE A MISTY BANNER OF WOVEN COPPER FLAMES NO NOR THAT THROUGH HER VEILS HER BODY GLEAMED FAINT RADIANCE IT WAS HER EYES HER GREAT WIDE EYES WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS WERE LIKE POOLS OF LIVING STAR FIRES
3486-166424-0034 THEY SHONE FROM HER WHITE FACE NOT PHOSPHORESCENT NOT MERELY LUCENT AND LIGHT REFLECTING BUT AS THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES WERE SOURCES OF THE COLD WHITE FLAMES OF FAR STARS AND AS CALM AS THOSE STARS THEMSELVES
3486-166424-0035 AND IN THAT FACE ALTHOUGH AS YET I COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT THE EYES I SENSED SOMETHING UNEARTHLY GOD WHISPERED VENTNOR WHAT IS SHE
3486-166424-0036 THE WOMAN STEPPED FROM THE CREVICE NOT FIFTY FEET FROM HER WERE RUTH AND DRAKE AND CHIU MING THEIR RIGID ATTITUDES REVEALING THE SAME SHOCK OF AWE THAT HAD MOMENTARILY PARALYZED ME SHE LOOKED AT THEM BECKONED THEM
3486-166424-0037 I SAW THE TWO WALK TOWARD HER CHIU MING HANG BACK THE GREAT EYES FELL UPON VENTNOR AND MYSELF SHE RAISED A HAND MOTIONED US TO APPROACH I TURNED THERE STOOD THE HOST THAT HAD POURED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ROAD
3486-166424-0038 HORSEMEN SPEARSMEN PIKEMEN A FULL THOUSAND OF THEM AT MY RIGHT WERE THE SCATTERED COMPANY THAT HAD COME FROM THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE THREESCORE OR MORE THERE SEEMED A SPELL UPON THEM
3486-166424-0039 THEY STOOD IN SILENCE LIKE AUTOMATONS ONLY THEIR FIERCELY STARING EYES SHOWING THAT THEY WERE ALIVE QUICK BREATHED VENTNOR WE RAN TOWARD HER WHO HAD CHECKED DEATH EVEN WHILE ITS JAWS WERE CLOSING UPON US
3486-166424-0040 BEFORE WE HAD GONE HALF WAY AS THOUGH OUR FLIGHT HAD BROKEN WHATEVER BONDS HAD BOUND THEM A CLAMOR AROSE FROM THE HOST A WILD SHOUTING A CLANGING OF SWORDS ON SHIELDS I SHOT A GLANCE BEHIND THEY WERE IN MOTION ADVANCING SLOWLY
3486-166424-0041 HESITATINGLY AS YET BUT I KNEW THAT SOON THAT HESITATION WOULD PASS THAT THEY WOULD SWEEP DOWN UPON US ENGULF US TO THE CREVICE I SHOUTED TO DRAKE HE PAID NO HEED TO ME NOR DID RUTH
3486-166424-0042 THEIR GAZE FASTENED UPON THE SWATHED WOMAN VENTNOR'S HAND SHOT OUT GRIPPED MY SHOULDER HALTED ME SHE HAD THROWN UP HER HEAD
3486-166424-0043 FROM THE LIFTED THROAT CAME A LOW A VIBRANT CRY HARMONIOUS WEIRDLY DISQUIETING GOLDEN AND SWEET AND LADEN WITH THE EERY MINOR WAILINGS OF THE BLUE VALLEY'S NIGHT THE DRAGONED CHAMBER
3486-166424-0044 BEFORE THE CRY HAD CEASED THERE POURED WITH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS OUT OF THE CREVICE SCORE UPON SCORE OF THE METAL THINGS THE FISSURES VOMITED THEM
3486-166424-0045 GLOBES AND CUBES AND PYRAMIDS NOT SMALL LIKE THOSE OF THE RUINS BUT SHAPES ALL OF FOUR FEET HIGH DULLY LUSTROUS AND DEEP WITHIN THAT LUSTER THE MYRIADS OF TINY POINTS OF LIGHT LIKE UNWINKING STARING EYES
3486-166424-0046 THEY SWIRLED EDDIED AND FORMED A BARRICADE BETWEEN US AND THE ARMORED MEN DOWN UPON THEM POURED A SHOWER OF ARROWS FROM THE SOLDIERS I HEARD THE SHOUTS OF THEIR CAPTAINS THEY RUSHED THEY HAD COURAGE THOSE MEN YES AGAIN CAME THE WOMAN'S CRY
3486-166424-0047 UP FROM THEM THRUST A THICK RECTANGULAR COLUMN
3486-166424-0048 EIGHT FEET IN WIDTH AND TWENTY FEET HIGH IT SHAPED ITSELF OUT FROM ITS LEFT SIDE FROM RIGHT SIDE SPRANG ARMS FEARFUL ARMS THAT GREW AND GREW AS GLOBE AND CUBE AND ANGLE RACED UP THE COLUMN'S SIDE AND CLICKED INTO PLACE EACH UPON EACH AFTER THE OTHER
3486-166424-0049 WITH MAGICAL QUICKNESS THE ARMS LENGTHENED BEFORE US STOOD A MONSTROUS SHAPE A GEOMETRIC PRODIGY
3486-166424-0050 A SHINING ANGLED PILLAR THAT THOUGH RIGID IMMOBILE SEEMED TO CROUCH BE INSTINCT WITH LIVING FORCE STRIVING TO BE UNLEASHED TWO GREAT GLOBES SURMOUNTED IT
3486-166424-0051 FLEXING THEMSELVES IN GROTESQUE IMITATION OF A BOXER
3486-166424-0052 AGAIN IN GIGANTIC AWFUL PARODY OF THE SPIKED GLOVES OF THOSE ANCIENT GLADIATORS WHO FOUGHT FOR IMPERIAL NERO
3486-166424-0053 PREENING TESTING ITSELF LIKE AN ATHLETE
3486-166424-0054 UNDER THE DARKENING SKY IN THE GREEN OF THE HOLLOW THE ARMORED HOSTS FROZEN BEFORE IT AND THEN IT STRUCK OUT FLASHED TWO OF THE ARMS WITH A GLANCING MOTION WITH APPALLING FORCE
3486-166424-0055 THEY SLICED INTO THE CLOSE PACKED FORWARD RANKS OF THE ARMORED MEN CUT OUT OF THEM TWO GREAT GAPS SICKENED I SAW FRAGMENTS OF MAN AND HORSE FLY ANOTHER ARM JAVELINED FROM ITS PLACE LIKE A FLYING SNAKE CLICKED AT THE END OF ANOTHER
3486-166424-0056 BECAME A HUNDRED FOOT CHAIN WHICH SWIRLED LIKE A FLAIL THROUGH THE HUDDLING MASS DOWN UPON A KNOT OF THE SOLDIERS WITH A STRAIGHT FORWARD BLOW DROVE A THIRD ARM DRIVING THROUGH THEM LIKE A GIANT PUNCH
3486-166424-0057 ALL THAT HOST WHICH HAD DRIVEN US FROM THE RUINS THREW DOWN SWORD SPEAR AND PIKE FLED SHRIEKING THE HORSEMEN SPURRED THEIR MOUNTS RIDING HEEDLESS OVER THE FOOTMEN WHO FLED WITH THEM THE SMITING THING SEEMED TO WATCH THEM GO
3486-166424-0058 WITH AMUSEMENT BEFORE THEY COULD COVER A HUNDRED YARDS IT HAD DISINTEGRATED I HEARD THE LITTLE WAILING SOUNDS THEN BEHIND THE FLEEING MEN CLOSE BEHIND THEM ROSE THE ANGLED PILLAR INTO PLACE SPRANG THE FLEXING ARMS AND AGAIN IT TOOK ITS TOLL OF THEM
3486-166424-0059 THEY SCATTERED RUNNING SINGLY BY TWOS IN LITTLE GROUPS FOR THE SIDES OF THE VALLEY THEY WERE LIKE RATS SCAMPERING IN PANIC OVER THE BOTTOM OF A GREAT GREEN BOWL AND LIKE A MONSTROUS CAT THE SHAPE PLAYED WITH THEM YES PLAYED
3486-166424-0060 IT MELTED ONCE MORE TOOK NEW FORM WHERE HAD BEEN PILLAR AND FLAILING ARMS WAS NOW A TRIPOD THIRTY FEET HIGH ITS LEGS ALTERNATE GLOBE AND CUBE AND UPON ITS APEX A WIDE AND SPINNING RING OF SPARKLING SPHERES
3486-166424-0061 OUT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THIS RING STRETCHED A TENTACLE WRITHING UNDULATING LIKE A SERPENT OF STEEL FOUR SCORE YARDS AT LEAST IN LENGTH
3486-166424-0062 WITH THE THREE LONG PRONGS OF THIS TRIDENT THE THING STRUCK SWIFTLY
3486-166424-0063 IT WAS I THINK THAT LAST TOUCH OF SHEER HORROR THE PLAYFULNESS OF THE SMITING THING THAT SENT MY DRY TONGUE TO THE ROOF OF MY TERROR PARCHED MOUTH AND HELD OPEN WITH MONSTROUS FASCINATION EYES THAT STRUGGLED TO CLOSE
3486-166424-0064 EVER THE ARMORED MEN FLED FROM IT AND EVER WAS IT SWIFTER THAN THEY TEETERING AT THEIR HEELS ON ITS TRIPOD LEGS FROM HALF ITS LENGTH THE DARTING SNAKE STREAMED RED RAIN I HEARD A SIGH FROM RUTH
3486-166424-0065 WRESTED MY GAZE FROM THE HOLLOW TURNED SHE LAY FAINTING IN DRAKE'S ARMS BESIDE THE TWO THE SWATHED WOMAN STOOD LOOKING OUT UPON THAT SLAUGHTER CALM AND STILL SHROUDED WITH AN UNEARTHLY TRANQUILLITY
3486-166424-0066 VIEWING IT IT CAME TO ME WITH EYES IMPERSONAL COLD INDIFFERENT AS THE UNTROUBLED STARS WHICH LOOK DOWN UPON HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE IN THIS WORLD OF OURS THERE WAS A RUSHING OF MANY FEET AT OUR LEFT A WAIL FROM CHIU MING
3486-166424-0067 WERE THEY MADDENED BY FEAR DRIVEN BY DESPAIR DETERMINED TO SLAY BEFORE THEY THEMSELVES WERE SLAIN I DO NOT KNOW BUT THOSE WHO STILL LIVED OF THE MEN FROM THE TUNNEL MOUTH WERE CHARGING US THEY CLUSTERED CLOSE THEIR SHIELDS HELD BEFORE THEM
3486-166424-0068 THEY HAD NO BOWS THESE MEN THEY MOVED SWIFTLY DOWN UPON US IN SILENCE SWORDS AND PIKES GLEAMING THE SMITING THING ROCKED TOWARD US THE METAL TENTACLE STRAINING OUT LIKE A RIGID RACING SERPENT FLYING TO CUT BETWEEN ITS WEIRD MISTRESS AND THOSE WHO MENACED HER
3486-166424-0069 I HEARD CHIU MING SCREAM SAW HIM THROW UP HIS HANDS COVER HIS EYES RUN STRAIGHT UPON THE PIKES CHIU MING I SHOUTED CHIU MING THIS WAY I RAN TOWARD HIM
3486-166424-0070 I SAW A SPEAR THROWN IT STRUCK THE CHINAMAN SQUARELY IN THE BREAST HE TOTTERED FELL UPON HIS KNEES EVEN AS HE DROPPED THE GIANT FLAIL SWEPT DOWN UPON THE SOLDIERS IT SWEPT THROUGH THEM LIKE A SCYTHE THROUGH RIPE GRAIN
3486-166424-0071 IT THREW THEM BROKEN AND TORN FAR TOWARD THE VALLEY'S SLOPING SIDES IT LEFT ONLY FRAGMENTS THAT BORE NO SEMBLANCE TO MEN VENTNOR WAS AT CHIU MING'S HEAD I DROPPED BESIDE HIM THERE WAS A CRIMSON FROTH UPON HIS LIPS
3486-166424-0072 I THOUGHT THAT SHIN JE WAS ABOUT TO SLAY US HE WHISPERED FEAR BLINDED ME HIS HEAD DROPPED HIS BODY QUIVERED LAY STILL WE AROSE LOOKED ABOUT US DAZEDLY
3486-166424-0073 AT THE SIDE OF THE CREVICE STOOD THE WOMAN HER GAZE RESTING UPON DRAKE HIS ARMS ABOUT RUTH HER HEAD HIDDEN ON HIS BREAST THE VALLEY WAS EMPTY SAVE FOR THE HUDDLED HEAPS THAT DOTTED IT
3486-166424-0074 HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN PATH A SCORE OF FIGURES CREPT ALL THAT WERE LEFT OF THOSE WHO BUT A LITTLE BEFORE HAD STREAMED DOWN TO TAKE US CAPTIVE OR TO SLAY
3486-166424-0075 HIGH UP IN THE DARKENING HEAVENS THE LAMMERGEIERS THE WINGED SCAVENGERS OF THE HIMALAYAS WERE GATHERING THE WOMAN LIFTED HER HAND BECKONED US ONCE MORE SLOWLY WE WALKED TOWARD HER STOOD BEFORE HER
3486-166446-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE DRUMS OF DESTINY SLOWLY WE DESCENDED THAT MOUNT OF DESOLATION LINGERINGLY AS THOUGH THE BROODING EYES OF NORHALA WERE NOT YET SATED WITH DESTRUCTION
3486-166446-0001 OF HUMAN LIFE OF GREEN LIFE OF LIFE OF ANY KIND THERE WAS NONE
3486-166446-0002 PALACE TEMPLE AND HOME NORHALA HAD STAMPED FLAT SHE HAD CRUSHED THEM WITHIN THE ROCK EVEN AS SHE HAD PROMISED THE TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY HAD ABSORBED MY EVERY FACULTY
3486-166446-0003 NOW IN THE PAINFUL SURGES OF AWAKENING REALIZATION OF FULL HUMAN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT INHUMAN ANNIHILATION I TURNED TO THEM FOR STRENGTH FAINTLY I WONDERED AGAIN AT RUTH'S SCANTINESS OF GARB HER MORE THAN HALF NUDITY
3486-166446-0004 DWELT CURIOUSLY UPON THE RED BRAND ACROSS VENTNOR'S FOREHEAD
3486-166446-0005 BUT IN THE EYES OF RUTH WAS NONE OF THIS STERNLY COLDLY TRIUMPHANT INDIFFERENT TO ITS PITEOUSNESS AS NORHALA HERSELF SHE SCANNED THE WASTE THAT LESS THAN AN HOUR SINCE HAD BEEN A PLACE OF LIVING BEAUTY I FELT A SHOCK OF REPULSION AFTER ALL
3486-166446-0006 YET MOTHER AND BLOSSOMING MAID YOUTH AND OLDSTER ALL THE PAGEANT OF HUMANITY WITHIN THE GREAT WALLS WERE NOW BUT LINES WITHIN THE STONE ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT LIGHTS IT CAME TO ME THERE HAD BEEN
3486-166446-0007 FROM NORHALA OF COURSE I LOOKED FOR NO PERCEPTION OF ANY OF THIS BUT FROM RUTH MY REACTION GREW
3486-166446-0008 THERE WAS DRIED BLOOD ON THE EDGES A DOUBLE RING OF SWOLLEN WHITE FLESH RIMMING THE CINCTURE IT WAS THE MARK OF TORTURE MARTIN I CRIED THAT RING WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU THEY WAKED ME WITH THAT HE ANSWERED QUIETLY
3486-166446-0009 I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL ALTHOUGH THEIR INTENTIONS WERE NOT EXACTLY THERAPEUTIC THEY TORTURED HIM RUTH'S VOICE WAS TENSE BITTER SHE SPOKE IN PERSIAN FOR NORHALA'S BENEFIT I THOUGHT THEN NOT GUESSING A DEEPER REASON
3486-166446-0010 THEY TORTURED HIM THEY GAVE HIM AGONY UNTIL HE RETURNED AND THEY PROMISED HIM OTHER AGONIES THAT WOULD MAKE HIM PRAY LONG FOR DEATH AND ME ME SHE RAISED LITTLE CLENCHED HANDS
3486-166446-0011 ME THEY STRIPPED LIKE A SLAVE THEY LED ME THROUGH THE CITY AND THE PEOPLE MOCKED ME
3486-166446-0012 BEFORE MY EYES THEY TORTURED MY BROTHER NORHALA THEY WERE EVIL ALL EVIL NORHALA YOU DID WELL TO SLAY THEM SHE CAUGHT THE WOMAN'S HANDS PRESSED CLOSE TO HER
3486-166446-0013 NORHALA GAZED AT HER FROM GREAT GRAY EYES IN WHICH THE WRATH WAS DYING INTO WHICH THE OLD TRANQUILLITY THE OLD SERENITY WAS FLOWING AND WHEN SHE SPOKE THE GOLDEN VOICE HELD MORE THAN RETURNING ECHOES OF THE FAR AWAY FAINT CHIMINGS IT IS DONE SHE SAID
3486-166446-0014 AND IT WAS WELL DONE SISTER NOW YOU AND I SHALL DWELL TOGETHER IN PEACE SISTER OR IF THERE BE THOSE IN THE WORLD FROM WHICH YOU CAME THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SLAIN
3486-166446-0015 THEN YOU AND I SHALL GO FORTH WITH OUR COMPANIES AND STAMP THEM OUT EVEN AS I DID THESE MY HEART STOPPED BEATING FOR FROM THE DEPTHS OF RUTH'S EYES SHINING SHADOWS WERE RISING WRAITHS ANSWERING NORHALA'S CALLING
3486-166446-0016 AND AS THEY ROSE STEADILY THEY DREW LIFE FROM THE CLEAR RADIANCE SUMMONING DREW CLOSER TO THE SEMBLANCE OF THAT TRANQUIL SPIRIT WHICH HER VENGEANCE HAD BANISHED
3486-166446-0017 AND AT LAST IT WAS TWIN SISTER OF NORHALA WHO LOOKED UPON HER FROM THE FACE OF RUTH THE WHITE ARMS OF THE WOMAN ENCIRCLED HER THE GLORIOUS HEAD BENT OVER HER FLAMING TRESSES MINGLED WITH TENDER BROWN CURLS
3486-166446-0018 SISTER SHE WHISPERED LITTLE SISTER THESE MEN YOU SHALL HAVE AS LONG AS IT PLEASES YOU TO DO WITH AS YOU WILL OR IF IT IS YOUR WISH THEY SHALL GO BACK TO THEIR WORLD AND I WILL GUARD THEM TO ITS GATES
3486-166446-0019 BUT YOU AND I LITTLE SISTER WILL DWELL TOGETHER IN THE VASTNESSES IN THE PEACE SHALL IT NOT BE SO WITH NO FALTERING WITH NO GLANCE TOWARD US THREE
3486-166446-0020 LOVER BROTHER OLD FRIEND RUTH CREPT CLOSER TO HER RESTED HER HEAD UPON THE VIRGINAL ROYAL BREASTS IT SHALL BE SO SHE MURMURED SISTER IT SHALL BE SO NORHALA I AM TIRED NORHALA I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF MEN
3486-166446-0021 AN ECSTASY OF TENDERNESS A FLAME OF UNEARTHLY RAPTURE TREMBLED OVER THE WOMAN'S WONDROUS FACE HUNGRILY DEFIANTLY SHE PRESSED THE GIRL TO HER THE STARS IN THE LUCID HEAVENS OF HER EYES WERE SOFT AND GENTLE AND CARESSING
3486-166446-0022 RUTH CRIED DRAKE AND SPRANG TOWARD THEM SHE PAID NO HEED AND EVEN AS HE LEAPED HE WAS CAUGHT WHIRLED BACK AGAINST US WAIT SAID VENTNOR
3486-166446-0023 THERE WAS A CURIOUS UNDERSTANDING IN HIS VOICE A CURIOUS SYMPATHY TOO IN THE PATIENT UNTROUBLED GAZE THAT DWELT UPON HIS SISTER AND THIS WEIRDLY EXQUISITE WOMAN WHO HELD HER WAIT EXCLAIMED DRAKE WAIT HELL THE DAMNED WITCH IS STEALING HER AWAY FROM US
3486-166446-0024 AGAIN HE THREW HIMSELF FORWARD RECOILED AS THOUGH SWEPT BACK BY AN INVISIBLE ARM FELL AGAINST US AND WAS CLASPED AND HELD BY VENTNOR AND AS HE STRUGGLED THE THING WE RODE HALTED
3486-166446-0025 LIKE METAL WAVES BACK INTO IT RUSHED THE ENIGMATIC BILLOWS THAT HAD WASHED OVER THE FRAGMENTS OF THE CITY WE WERE LIFTED BETWEEN US AND THE WOMAN AND GIRL A CLEFT APPEARED IT WIDENED INTO A RIFT
3486-166446-0026 IT WAS AS THOUGH NORHALA HAD DECREED IT AS A SYMBOL OF THIS HER SECOND VICTORY OR HAD SET IT BETWEEN US AS A BARRIER WIDER GREW THE RIFT
3486-166446-0027 SAVE FOR THE BRIDGE OF OUR VOICES IT SEPARATED US FROM RUTH AS THOUGH SHE STOOD UPON ANOTHER WORLD HIGHER WE ROSE THE THREE OF US NOW UPON THE FLAT TOP OF A TOWER UPON WHOSE COUNTERPART FIFTY FEET AWAY
3486-166446-0028 QUIETLY IT GLIDED TO THE CHASM IT HAD BLASTED IN THE CLIFF WALL THE SHADOW OF THOSE WALLS FELL UPON US AS ONE WE LOOKED BACK AS ONE WE SEARCHED OUT THE PATCH OF BLUE WITH THE BLACK BLOT AT ITS BREAST WE FOUND IT THEN THE PRECIPICES HID IT
3486-166446-0029 SILENTLY WE STREAMED THROUGH THE CHASM THROUGH THE CANYON AND THE TUNNEL SPEAKING NO WORD DRAKE'S EYES FIXED WITH BITTER HATRED UPON NORHALA VENTNOR BROODING UPON HER ALWAYS WITH THAT ENIGMATIC SYMPATHY WE PASSED BETWEEN THE WALLS OF THE FURTHER CLEFT
3486-166446-0030 STOOD FOR AN INSTANT AT THE BRINK OF THE GREEN FOREST THERE CAME TO US AS THOUGH FROM IMMEASURABLE DISTANCES A FAINT SUSTAINED THRUMMING LIKE THE BEATING OF COUNTLESS MUFFLED DRUMS THE THING THAT CARRIED US TREMBLED THE SOUND DIED AWAY
3486-166446-0031 THE THING QUIETED IT BEGAN ITS STEADY EFFORTLESS STRIDING THROUGH THE CROWDING TREES BUT NOW WITH NONE OF THAT SPEED WITH WHICH IT HAD COME SPURRED FORWARD BY NORHALA'S AWAKENED HATE VENTNOR STIRRED
3486-166446-0032 PURGED NOT ONLY BY SUFFERING BUT BY IT CAME TO ME SOME STRANGE KNOWLEDGE NO USE DRAKE HE SAID DREAMILY
3486-166446-0033 BUT THIS I DO KNOW ONLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER CAN THE BALANCE FALL AND IF IT BE ONE WAY THEN YOU AND WE SHALL HAVE RUTH BACK AND IF IT FALLS THE OTHER WAY THEN THERE WILL BE LITTLE NEED FOR US TO CARE FOR MAN WILL BE DONE MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN
3486-166446-0034 IT IS THE CRISIS HE ANSWERED WE CAN DO NOTHING GOODWIN NOTHING WHATEVER IS TO BE STEPS FORTH NOW FROM THE WOMB OF DESTINY AGAIN THERE CAME THAT DISTANT ROLLING LOUDER NOW AGAIN THE THING TREMBLED
3486-166446-0035 IS IT TAPS FOR THEM THE DRUMMING DIED AS I LISTENED FEARFULLY ABOUT US WAS ONLY THE SWISHING THE SIGHING OF THE FALLING TREES BENEATH THE TREAD OF THE THING MOTIONLESS STOOD NORHALA
3486-166446-0036 AND AS MOTIONLESS RUTH MARTIN I CRIED ONCE MORE A DREADFUL DOUBT UPON ME MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHENCE DID THEY COME HIS VOICE WAS CLEAR AND CALM THE EYES BENEATH
3486-166446-0037 THESE CREATURES THAT WHEN MANY STILL ARE ONE THAT WHEN ONE STILL ARE MANY WHENCE DID THEY COME WHAT ARE THEY HE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE CUBES THAT HELD US THEIR HOSTS OF TINY EYES SHONE UP AT HIM ENIGMATICALLY
3486-166446-0038 AS THOUGH THEY HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD I DO NOT FORGET HE SAID AT LEAST NOT ALL DO I FORGET OF WHAT I SAW DURING THAT TIME WHEN I SEEMED AN ATOM OUTSIDE SPACE
3486-166446-0039 AS I TOLD YOU OR THINK I TOLD YOU SPEAKING WITH UNTHINKABLE EFFORT THROUGH LIPS THAT SEEMED ETERNITIES AWAY FROM ME THE ATOM WHO STROVE TO OPEN THEM
3486-166446-0040 REVELATIONS I KNOW NOT WHAT TO CALL THEM AND THOUGH EACH SEEMED EQUALLY REAL OF TWO OF THEM ONLY ONE I THINK CAN BE TRUE AND OF THE THIRD THAT MAY SOME TIME BE TRUE BUT SURELY IS NOT YET THROUGH THE AIR CAME A LOUDER DRUM ROLL
3486-166446-0041 IN IT SOMETHING OMINOUS SOMETHING SINISTER IT SWELLED TO A CRESCENDO ABRUPTLY CEASED AND NOW I SAW NORHALA RAISE HER HEAD LISTEN I SAW A WORLD A VAST WORLD GOODWIN MARCHING STATELY THROUGH SPACE
3486-166446-0042 IT WAS NO GLOBE IT WAS A WORLD OF MANY FACETS OF SMOOTH AND POLISHED PLANES
3486-166446-0043 A GEOMETRIC THOUGHT OF THE GREAT CAUSE OF GOD IF YOU WILL MADE MATERIAL IT WAS AIRLESS WATERLESS SUNLESS
3830-12529-0000 A BEAUTIFUL PEBBLY BEACH EXTENDED ALMOST TO THE WATER'S EDGE EVEN AT LOW TIDE THERE WAS A GRASSY LEVEL SPIT A BACKGROUND OF EVERGREEN GIANT FIR TIMBER
3830-12529-0001 AND SUCH FUEL FOR THE CAMP FIRE BROKEN LIMBS WITH JUST ENOUGH PITCH TO MAKE A CHEERFUL BLAZE AND YET BODY ENOUGH TO LAST WELL
3830-12529-0002 GLAD THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED OLIVER WAS THE CARPENTER OF THE PARTY THE TENT BUILDER WOOD GETTER AND GENERAL ROUSTABOUT WHILE I THE JUNIOR WAS CHIEF COOK AND BOTTLE WASHER
3830-12529-0003 AN ENCAMPMENT OF INDIANS BEING NEAR A PARTY OF THEM SOON VISITED OUR CAMP AND BEGAN MAKING SIGNS FOR TRADE
3830-12529-0004 SAID ONE OF THE MATRONS OF THE PARTY WHAT DOES SHE SAY OLIVER I'M BLESSED IF I KNOW BUT IT LOOKS AS IF SHE WANTED TO SELL SOME CLAMS AFTER CONSIDERABLE DICKERING WITH SIGNS AND GESTURES AND WORDS MANY TIMES REPEATED
3830-12529-0005 WE WERE ABLE TO IMPART THE INFORMATION THAT WE WANTED
3830-12530-0000 SOON WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A FLEET OF SEVEN VESSELS LYING AT ANCHOR IN A LARGE BAY SEVERAL MILES IN EXTENT THE SIGHT OF THOSE SEVEN VESSELS LYING IN THE OFFING MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION UPON OUR MINDS
3830-12530-0001 WE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SO MANY SHIPS AT ONE PLACE CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AMONG THEM WAS THE GOOD BARK MARY MELVILLE WITH HER GRUFF MATE AND BIG HEARTED MASTER CAPTAIN BARSTON
3830-12530-0002 UPON THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE SHORES OF THIS BAY LAY THE TWO TOWNS PORT STEILACOOM AND STEILACOOM CITY BOTH ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE A FAR LARGER TRADE CENTERED HERE THAN AT ANY OTHER POINT ON PUGET SOUND
3830-12530-0003 AND WE DECIDED ON A HALT TO MAKE OURSELVES ACQUAINTED WITH THE SURROUNDINGS A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE SHORE WE FOUND ALSO FORT STEILACOOM IT WAS SIMPLY THE CAMP OF A COMPANY OF UNITED STATES SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN WOODEN SHELLS OF HOUSES
3830-12530-0004 AND LOG CABINS INTENSE RIVALRY RAN BETWEEN THE TWO TOWNS UPPER AND LOWER STEILACOOM AT THIS TIME AS A RESULT THINGS WERE BOOMING
3830-12530-0005 WE WERE SORELY TEMPTED TO ACCEPT THE FLATTERING OFFER OF FOUR DOLLARS A DAY FOR COMMON LABOR IN A TIMBER CAMP BUT CONCLUDED NOT TO BE SWERVED FROM THE SEARCH FOR A NEW HOMESITE DURING THIS VISIT WE BEGAN SEEING INDIANS IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS
3830-12530-0006 THEY SEEMED TO BE A LISTLESS LOT WITH NO THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE OR EVEN FOR THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT THE INDIANS IN THOSE DAYS SEEMED TO WORK OR PLAY BY SPURTS AND SPELLS HERE AND THERE WE SAW A FAMILY
3830-12530-0007 BUT AS A CLASS THEY SEEMED TO ME THE LAZIEST SET OF PEOPLE ON EARTH THAT OPINION WAS MATERIALLY MODIFIED LATER AS I BECAME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR HABITS I HAVE FOUND JUST AS INDUSTRIOUS PEOPLE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
3830-12530-0008 AMONG THE INDIANS AS AMONG THE WHITES THE WORKERS IT MAY BE SAID ARE LESS NUMEROUS AMONG THE MEN THE WOMEN ARE ALL INDUSTRIOUS SHOULD WE CAMP HERE AND SPY OUT THE LAND OR SHOULD WE GO FORWARD AND SEE WHAT LAY BEFORE US
3830-12530-0009 AFTER A SOBER SECOND THOUGHT WE REALIZED THAT WE HAD NOTHING TO TRADE BUT LABOR AND WE HAD NOT COME AS FAR AS THIS TO BE LABORERS FOR HIRE WE HAD COME TO FIND A PLACE TO MAKE A FARM
3830-12530-0010 AND A FARM WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AGAIN WE SET ABOUT SEARCHING FOR CLAIMS AND THE MORE WE SEARCHED THE LESS WE LIKED THE LOOK OF THINGS FINALLY ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER A LONG WEARISOME TRAMP WE CAST OFF AT HIGH TIDE
3830-12530-0011 AND IN A DEAD CALM TO CONTINUE OUR CRUISE OLIVER SOON DROPPED INTO A COMFORTABLE AFTERNOON NAP LEAVING ME IN FULL COMMAND AS THE SUN SHONE WARM AND THE TIDE WAS TAKING US RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION WE WANTED TO GO
3830-12530-0012 WHY SHOULDN'T I DOZE A LITTLE TOO EVEN IF WE DID MISS SOME OF THE SIGHTSEEING I WAS AROUSED FROM MY NAP BY OLIVER'S EXCLAIMING WHAT IS THAT THEN HALF TO HIMSELF AS I LIVE IT'S A DEER SWIMMING OUT HERE IN THE BAY
3830-12530-0013 IT SURELY CAN'T BE I RESPONDED THREE QUARTERS ASLEEP THAT'S WHAT IT IS HE ASSERTED WE WERE WIDE AWAKE NOW AND GAVE CHASE VERY SOON WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE ANIMAL AND SUCCEEDED IN THROWING A ROPE OVER ITS HORNS
3830-12530-0014 BY THIS TIME WE HAD DRIFTED INTO THE NARROWS AND WE SOON FOUND WE HAD SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAN TO TOW A DEER
3830-12530-0015 A PERPENDICULAR BLUFF ROSE FROM THE HIGHWATER MARK LEAVING NO PLACE FOR CAMP FIRE OR BED
3830-12530-0016 AND WITH CONTENDING FORCES OF CURRENTS AND COUNTER CURRENTS YET ALL MOVING IN A GENERAL DIRECTION IT WAS OUR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO A GENUINE TIDE RIP THE WATERS BOILED AS IF IN A VERITABLE CALDRON SWELLING UP HERE AND THERE
3830-12530-0017 GIVE ME THE SALMON CAUGHT BY TROLLING IN EARLY SUMMER IN THE DEEP WATERS OF PUGET SOUND THE FISH SO FAT THAT THE EXCESS OF OIL MUST BE TURNED OUT OF THE PAN WHILE COOKING
3830-12530-0018 THE FOLLOWING DAY WE COULD SEE MT RAINIER WITH ITS REFLECTION IN THE PLACID WATERS OF THE BAY THEODORE WINTHROP THE OBSERVANT TRAVELER WHO CAME INTO THESE SAME WATERS A FEW MONTHS LATER AND WROTE OF IT AS MT TACOMA
3830-12530-0019 DESCRIBED IT AS A GIANT MOUNTAIN DOME OF SNOW SEEMING TO FILL THE AERIAL SPACES AS THE IMAGE DISPLACED THE BLUE DEEPS OF TRANQUIL WATER A WONDROUS SIGHT IT WAS AND IS WHATEVER THE NAME NEXT DAY WE ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE PUYALLUP
3830-12530-0020 AND THAT THE CURRENT WAS VERY STRONG WE SECURED THE SERVICES OF AN INDIAN AND HIS CANOE TO HELP US UP THE RIVER AND LEFT OUR BOAT AT THE INDIANS CAMP NEAR THE MOUTH IT TOOK A TUGGING OF TWO DAYS TO GO SIX MILES
3830-12530-0021 AND DRAG OUR CANOE AROUND THE DRIFTS IT WAS A STORY OF CONSTANT TOIL WITH CONSEQUENT DISCOURAGEMENT NOT ENDING UNTIL WE CAMPED
3830-12530-0022 AN INDIAN TRAIL LED UP THE RIVER FROM
3830-12530-0023 BUT WAGON ROADS THERE WERE NONE AND WHETHER A FEASIBLE ROUTE FOR ONE COULD BE FOUND ONLY TIME AND LABOR COULD DETERMINE WE RETRACED OUR STEPS AND IN THE EVENING LANDED AGAIN AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AFTER A SEVERE DAY'S TOIL WE WERE IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD
3830-12530-0024 OLIVER DID NOT SING AS USUAL WHILE PREPARING FOR CAMP NEITHER DID I HAVE MUCH TO SAY BUT I FELL TO WORK MECHANICALLY PREPARING THE MUCH NEEDED MEAL WE ATE IN SILENCE AND THEN WENT TO SLEEP
3830-12530-0025 OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES OF UNOCCUPIED PRAIRIE LAND AS RICH AS ANYTHING THAT EVER LAY OUT OF DOORS ON OUR WAY FROM INDIANA TO OREGON IN SEARCH OF LAND ON WHICH TO MAKE A HOME HERE AT WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE END OF OUR ROPE
3830-12530-0026 WE HAD FOUND THE LAND BUT WITH CONDITIONS THAT SEEMED ALMOST TOO ADVERSE TO OVERCOME IT WAS A DISCOURAGING OUTLOOK EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ROADS SUCH TIMBER IT SEEMED AN APPALLING UNDERTAKING TO CLEAR THIS LAND
3830-12530-0027 WHEN WE FELL ASLEEP THAT NIGHT IT WAS WITHOUT VISIONS OF NEW FOUND WEALTH AND YET LATER I DID TACKLE A QUARTER SECTION OF THAT HEAVIEST TIMBER LAND AND NEVER LET UP UNTIL THE LAST TREE LOG STUMP AND ROOT HAD DISAPPEARED
3830-12530-0028 THOUGH OF COURSE NOT ALL CLEARED OFF BY MY OWN HANDS IF WE COULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS COMING FOUR MONTHS LATER WE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN SPITE OF OUR DISCOURAGEMENT
3830-12530-0029 PASS TRAIL INTO WASHINGTON THEY LOCATED IN A BODY OVER NEARLY THE WHOLE VALLEY AND BEFORE THE YEAR WAS ENDED HAD MADE A ROUGH WAGON ROAD OUT TO THE PRAIRIES
3830-12530-0030 LEST SOME SMART FELLOW SHOULD UP AND SAY I WAS DRAWING ON MY IMAGINATION I AM NOT WHEN WE HAD BROKEN CAMP AND WERE SAILING ALONG WE HEARD A DULL SOUND LIKE THAT OFTEN HEARD
3830-12530-0031 IT EXTENDED AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE IN THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING THE SOUND INCREASED AND BECAME LIKE THE ROAR OF A HEAVY FALL OF RAIN OR HAIL ON WATER AND WE BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS A VAST SCHOOL OF FISH MOVING SOUTH
3830-12530-0032 WHILE MILLIONS WERE SEEMINGLY DANCING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER OR LEAPING IN THE AIR WE COULD FEEL THE FISH STRIKING AGAINST THE BOAT IN SUCH VAST NUMBERS THAT THEY FAIRLY MOVED IT THE LEAP IN THE AIR WAS SO HIGH
3830-12530-0033 ONE WOULD DROP INTO THE BOAT WE SOON DISCOVERED SOME INDIANS FOLLOWING THE SCHOOL
3830-12530-0034 WITH AN IMPROVISED NET WE TOO SOON OBTAINED ALL WE WANTED WHEN WE BEGAN TO GO ON WE WERE EMBARRASSED BY THE MASS OF FISH MOVING IN THE WATER AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO END TO THE SCHOOL AHEAD OF US BUT WE FINALLY GOT CLEAR OF THE MOVING MASS
3830-12530-0035 AND REACHED THE ISLAND SHORE IN SAFETY ONLY TO BECOME WEATHER BOUND IN THE WILDS ONCE MORE THIS CAMP DID NOT PROVE SO DREARY AS THE LAST ONE ALTHOUGH IT WAS MORE EXPOSED TO THE SWELL OF THE BIG WATERS
3830-12530-0036 AND THE SWEEP OF THE WIND TO THE NORTH WE HAD A VIEW OF THIRTY MILES OR MORE TO WHERE HORIZON AND WATER BLENDED LEAVING IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER LAND WAS IN SIGHT OR NOT AS WE AFTERWARDS ASCERTAINED WE COULD SEE THE FAMOUS SAN JUAN ISLAND
3830-12530-0037 LATER THE BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AND GREAT BRITAIN WHEN THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS SETTLED PORT TOWNSEND LAY
3830-12530-0038 THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE TOWN LIKE THE LOST HUNTERS WE KNEW WHERE WE WERE BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ANY PLACE ELSE WAS NOT LOST OURSELVES THE WORLD WAS LOST FROM US THREE SHIPS PASSED US WHILE WE WERE AT THIS CAMP
3830-12530-0039 A MERE SPECK AND GROWING TO A FULL FLEDGED DEEP SEA VESSEL WITH ALL SAILS SET SCUDDING BEFORE THE WIND THE OTHER TWO WERE GRACEFULLY BEATING THEIR WAY OUT
3830-12530-0040 WITH THE BEAUTIFUL OPEN AND COMPARATIVELY LEVEL PLATEAU IN THE BACKGROUND AND TWO OR THREE VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN THE FOREGROUND MADE A PICTURE OF A PERFECT CITY SITE
3830-12530-0041 MANY SHACKS AND CAMPS AT FIRST MISTAKEN FOR THE WHITE MEN'S HOUSES WERE FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY NATIVES THEY WERE A DRUNKEN RASCALLY RABBLE SPENDING THEIR GAINS FROM THE SALE OF FISH AND OIL
3830-12530-0042 IN A DEBAUCH THAT WOULD LAST AS LONG AS THEIR MONEY HELD OUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A MORE STALWART RACE OF INDIANS THAN THOSE TO THE SOUTH DOUBTLESS FROM THE BUFFETING RECEIVED IN THE LARGER WATERS THEY WOULD OFTEN GO OUT EVEN TO THE OPEN SEA
3830-12530-0043 ON THEIR FISHING EXCURSIONS IN CANOES MANNED BY THIRTY MEN OR MORE AFTER SPENDING TWO OR THREE DAYS EXPLORING THE COUNTRY WE TURNED BACK TO THE BAY WHERE LAY THE SEVEN SHIPS WE HAD SEEN NEAR STEILACOOM WE REMEMBERED THE TIMBER CAMPS
3830-12530-0044 THE BUSTLE AND STIR OF THE LITTLE NEW VILLAGE AND THE ACTIVITY THAT WE SAW THERE GREATER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE WATERS OF THE SOUND MOST OF ALL MY THOUGHTS WOULD GO ON TO THE LITTLE CABIN ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER THREE DAYS SUFFICED TO LAND
3830-12530-0045 US BACK IN THE BAY WE SOUGHT BUT THE SHIPS WERE GONE NOT A SAILING CRAFT OF ANY KIND WAS IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE TOWN
3830-12531-0000 CAN I GET HOME TONIGHT I ASKED MYSELF IT WAS AN AFTERNOON OF THE LAST WEEK OF JUNE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND THE SUN WAS YET HIGH I WAS WELL UP THE LEFT BANK OF THE COWLITZ RIVER HOW FAR I COULD NOT TELL
3830-12531-0001 FOR THERE WERE NO MILESTONES ON THE CROOKED HALF OBSTRUCTED TRAIL LEADING DOWNSTREAM AT BEST IT WOULD BE A RACE WITH THE SUN BUT THE DAYS WERE LONG AND THE TWILIGHT WAS LONG
3830-12531-0002 I WORE A HEAVY WOOLEN SHIRT A SLOUCH HAT AND WORN SHOES BOTH HAT AND SHOES GAVE AMPLE VENTILATION SOCKS I HAD NONE NEITHER HAD I SUSPENDERS AN IMPROVISED BELT
3830-12531-0003 TAKING THEIR PLACE I WAS DRESSED FOR THE RACE AND WAS EAGER FOR THE TRIAL AT OLYMPIA I HAD PARTED WITH MY BROTHER
3830-12531-0004 WHILE I WAS TO GO HOME FOR THE WIFE AND BABY TO REMOVE THEM TO OUR NEW HOME I DID NOT PARTICULARLY MIND THE CAMPING BUT I DID NOT FANCY THE IDEA OF LYING OUT SO NEAR HOME IF BY EXTRA EXERTION I COULD REACH THE CABIN BEFORE NIGHT
3830-12531-0005 WE NEVER THOUGHT OF CATCHING COLD FROM LYING ON THE GROUND OR ON CEDAR BOUGHS OR FROM GETTING A GOOD DRENCHING AFTER ALL THE CABIN COULD NOT BE REACHED AS THE TRAIL COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED AT NIGHT
3830-12531-0006 SLACKENING PACE AT NIGHTFALL TO COOL MY SYSTEM GRADUALLY I FINALLY MADE MY CAMP AND SLEPT AS SOUNDLY AS IF ON A BED OF DOWN MY CONSOLATION WAS THAT THE NIGHT WAS SHORT AND I COULD SEE TO TRAVEL BY THREE O'CLOCK
3830-12531-0007 I DO NOT LOOK UPON THOSE YEARS OF CAMP AND CABIN LIFE AS YEARS OF HARDSHIP TO BE SURE OUR FOOD WAS PLAIN AS WELL AS OUR DRESS OUR HOURS OF LABOR WERE LONG AND THE LABOR ITSELF WAS FREQUENTLY SEVERE THE PIONEERS APPEARED ROUGH AND UNCOUTH
3830-12531-0008 WE NEVER WATCHED FOR THE SUN TO GO DOWN
3830-12531-0009 OR FOR THE BOSS TO QUICKEN OUR STEPS THE DAYS WERE ALWAYS TOO SHORT AND INTEREST IN OUR WORK WAS ALWAYS UNABATED THE CABIN COULD NOT BE SEEN UNTIL THE TRAIL CAME QUITE NEAR IT WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CURL OF SMOKE I KNEW I WAS ALMOST THERE THEN I SAW THE CABIN
3830-12531-0010 AND A LITTLE LADY IN ALMOST BLOOMER DRESS MILKING THE COW SHE NEVER FINISHED MILKING THAT COW NOR DID SHE EVER MILK ANY COW WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS AT HOME THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE COULD SCARCELY TELL WHERE TO BEGIN OR WHEN TO STOP
3830-12531-0011 MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY CENTERED ON THE QUESTION OF OUR MOVING TO A NEW HOME WHY AT OLYMPIA EGGS WERE A DOLLAR A DOZEN I SAW THEM SELLING AT THAT THE BUTTER YOU HAVE THERE WOULD BRING YOU A DOLLAR A POUND AS FAST AS YOU COULD WEIGH IT OUT
3830-12531-0012 I SAW STUFF THEY CALLED BUTTER SELL FOR THAT POTATOES ARE SELLING FOR THREE DOLLARS A BUSHEL AND ONIONS AT FOUR EVERYTHING THE FARMER RAISES SELLS HIGH WHO BUYS OH ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS TO BUY
3830-12531-0013 WHERE DO THEY GET THE MONEY EVERYBODY SEEMS TO HAVE MONEY SOME TAKE IT THERE WITH THEM MEN WORKING IN THE TIMBER CAMPS GET FOUR DOLLARS A DAY AND THEIR BOARD AT ONE PLACE THEY PAID FOUR DOLLARS A CORD FOR WOOD TO SHIP TO SAN FRANCISCO
3830-12531-0014 AND A MAN CAN SELL ALL THE SHINGLES HE CAN MAKE AT FOUR DOLLARS A THOUSAND I WAS OFFERED FIVE CENTS A FOOT FOR PILES IF WE HAD BUCK AND DANDY OVER THERE WE COULD MAKE TWENTY DOLLARS A DAY
3830-12531-0015 OFF THE GOVERNMENT LAND OF COURSE ALL HELP THEMSELVES TO WHAT THEY WANT THEN THERE ARE THE FISH AND THE CLAMS AND OYSTERS AND BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LAND FOR THE CLAIM THAT QUESTION WAS A STUMPER THE LITTLE WIFE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT BARGAIN MADE BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED
3830-12531-0016 NOW I FOUND MYSELF PRAISING A COUNTRY FOR THE AGRICULTURAL QUALITIES OF WHICH I COULD NOT SAY MUCH BUT IF WE COULD SELL PRODUCE HIGHER MIGHT WE NOT WELL LOWER OUR STANDARD OF AN IDEAL FARM THE CLAIM I HAD TAKEN WAS DESCRIBED WITH A TOUCH OF APOLOGY
3830-12531-0017 HOWEVER WE DECIDED TO MOVE AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR THE JOURNEY THE WIFE BABY BEDDING OX YOKE AND LOG CHAIN WERE SENT UP THE COWLITZ IN A CANOE BUCK AND DANDY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0018 ON THIS OCCASION I WAS ILL PREPARED FOR A COOL NIGHT CAMP HAVING NEITHER BLANKET NOR COAT I HAD EXPECTED TO REACH HARD BREAD'S HOTEL WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE CANOE WOULD STOP OVERNIGHT BUT I COULD NOT MAKE IT SO AGAIN I LAY OUT ON THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0019 HARD BREAD'S AN ODD NAME FOR A HOTEL WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE THE OLD WIDOWER THAT KEPT THE PLACE FED HIS PATRONS ON HARDTACK THREE TIMES A DAY I FOUND THAT MY WIFE HAD NOT FARED ANY BETTER THAN I HAD ON THE TRAIL AND IN FACT
3830-12531-0020 NOT SO WELL THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN THAT IS THE HOTEL WAS A GREAT DEAL HARDER THAN THE SAND SPIT WHERE I HAD PASSED THE NIGHT I HAD PLENTY OF PURE FRESH AIR WHILE SHE IN A CLOSED CABIN
3830-12531-0021 AND IN THE SAME ROOM WITH MANY OTHERS HAD NEITHER FRESH AIR NOR FREEDOM FROM CREEPING THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE MISERABLE WITH HER SHOES FOR A PILLOW A SHAWL FOR COVERING SMALL WONDER THAT SHE REPORTED I DID NOT SLEEP A WINK LAST NIGHT
3830-12531-0022 WE SOON ARRIVED AT THE COWLITZ LANDING THE END OF THE CANOE JOURNEY STRIKING THE TENT THAT HAD SERVED US SO WELL ON THE PLAINS AND MAKING A CHEERFUL CAMP FIRE WE SPEEDILY FORGOT THE HARD EXPERIENCES OF THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0023 FIFTY MILES MORE OF TRAVEL LAY BEFORE US AND SUCH A ROAD HOWEVER WE HAD ONE CONSOLATION IT WOULD BE WORSE IN WINTER THAN AT THAT TIME
3830-12531-0024 OUR COWS WERE GONE GIVEN FOR PROVENDER TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE OXEN DURING THE DEEP DECEMBER SNOW SO WHEN WE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK WE HAD THE BABY BUCK AND DANDY A TENT AN OX YOKE AND CHAIN ENOUGH CLOTHING AND BEDDING TO KEEP US COMFORTABLE
3830-12531-0025 A VERY LITTLE FOOD AND NO MONEY THE MONEY HAD ALL BEEN EXPENDED ON THE CANOE PASSAGE SHOULD WE PACK THE OXEN AND WALK
3830-12531-0026 THIS LAST PROPOSITION WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE AND SO NEXT MORNING DRIVING MY OXEN BEFORE ME AND LEAVING WIFE AND BABY TO TAKE CARE OF THE CAMP
3830-12531-0027 STRANGER THOUGH I WAS TO SAY YES YOU CAN HAVE TWO IF YOU NEED THEM JACKSON HAD SETTLED THERE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE
3830-12531-0028 THE DREAD DISEASE HAD TERRORS THEN THAT IT DOES NOT NOW POSSESS COULD IT BE POSSIBLE MY FOLKS HAD BEEN TAKEN SICK
3830-12531-0029 IT APPEARED THAT I HAD SCARCELY GOT OUT OF SIGHT ON MY TRIP BACK WITH THE OXEN BEFORE ONE OF THOSE ROYAL PIONEER MATRONS HAD COME TO THE CAMP SHE PLEADED AND INSISTED AND FINALLY ALMOST FRIGHTENED THE LITTLE WIFE INTO GOING WITH HER
3830-12531-0030 AND SHARING HER HOUSE WHICH WAS NEAR BY
3830-12531-0031 FINDING THAT THE BOAT AND PROVISIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN AND SEEING SMOKE IN THE BIGHT
3830-12535-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FINDING MY PEOPLE ON LEAVING MY NEWLY FOUND FRIENDS I FACED A DISCOURAGING PROSPECT THE START FOR THE HIGH ARID TABLE LANDS BORDERING THE YAKIMA VALLEY CUT ME LOOSE FROM ALL COMMUNICATION
3830-12535-0001 NO MORE IMMIGRANTS WERE MET UNTIL I REACHED THE MAIN TRAVELED ROUTE BEYOND THE COLUMBIA RIVER THE ROAD LAY THROUGH A FORBIDDING SAGE PLAIN OR RATHER AN UNDULATING COUNTRY COVERED BY SHIFTING SANDS
3830-12535-0002 AS THE SUN ROSE THE HEAT BECAME INTOLERABLE THE DUST IN PLACES BROUGHT VIVID MEMORIES OF THE TRIP ACROSS THE PLAINS
3830-12535-0003 TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE EXPECTED TRAIN
3830-12535-0004 AND COMPELLED ME TO LEAVE THE ROAD AND DESCEND INTO THE VALLEY FOR WATER
3830-12535-0005 THAT LASTED UNTIL DURING THE AFTERNOON WHEN I FOUND WATER ON THE TRAIL TETHERING MY PONY FOR HIS MUCH NEEDED DINNER I OPENED MY SACK OF HARD BREAD TO COUNT THE CONTENTS MY STORE WAS HALF GONE I LAY DOWN IN THE SHADE OF A SMALL TREE
3830-12535-0006 NEAR THE SPRING TO TAKE AN AFTERNOON NAP ROUSING BEFORE SUNDOWN REFRESHED BOBBY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL WITH NEW COURAGE WHEN NIGHT CAME I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO CAMP THE COOL OF THE EVENING INVIGORATED THE PONY AND WE PUSHED ON
3830-12535-0007 FINDING THAT THE ROAD COULD BE FOLLOWED THOUGH BUT DIMLY SEEN I KEPT ON THE TRAIL UNTIL A LATE HOUR WHEN I UNSADDLED AND HOBBLED THE PONY THE SADDLE BLANKET WAS BROUGHT INTO USE AND I WAS SOON OFF IN DREAMLAND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE DUST THE TRAIL OR THE MORROW
3830-12535-0008 TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HIS HOBBLES HAD BECOME LOOSENED GIVING HIM FREE USE OF ALL HIS FEET AND HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO TAKE THE TRAIL AGAIN COAXING WAS OF NO AVAIL DRIVING WOULD DO NO GOOD
3830-12535-0009 I FOLLOWED HIM AROUND ABOUT OVER THE PLAIN AND THROUGH THE SAGE BRUSH AT A RAPID GAIT FINALLY HE SLACKENED PACE AND I AGAIN BECAME MASTER
3830-12535-0010 ALL THIS ROAMING OVER THE PLAIN AT BOBBY'S HEELS BUT I HAPPENED TO TAKE THE RIGHT COURSE WHEN THE TRAIL WAS FOUND THERE WAS THE SADDLE TO LOOK FOR AND THIS WAS LOCATED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
3830-12535-0011 A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF TRAVEL BROUGHT UNEASINESS AS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE NOT ON THE REGULAR TRAIL NOT KNOWING BUT THIS WAS SOME CUT OFF I WENT ON UNTIL THE COLUMBIA RIVER BLUFF WAS REACHED AND THE GREAT RIVER WAS IN SIGHT
3830-12535-0012 HALF A MILE DISTANT AND SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET LOWER TAKING A TRAIL DOWN THE BLUFF THAT SEEMED MORE PROMISING THAN THE WAGON TRACKS I BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR THE ROAD AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF
3830-12535-0013 ONLY TO FIND EVERY SEMBLANCE OF A ROAD GONE I LOST MORE THAN A HALF DAY'S PRECIOUS TIME AND AGAIN WAS THROWN INTO ANXIETY LEST I HAD MISSED THE LONG SOUGHT TRAIN THE NEXT INCIDENT THAT I REMEMBER VIVIDLY WAS MY ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE COLUMBIA
3830-12535-0014 JUST BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE SNAKE RIVER I HAD SEEN BUT FEW INDIANS ON THE WHOLE TRIP AND IN FACT THE CAMP I FOUND THERE ON THE BANK OF THE GREAT RIVER WAS THE FIRST I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER COMING UPON I COULD NOT INDUCE THE INDIANS TO CROSS ME OVER
3830-12535-0015 THEY SEEMED SURLY AND UNFRIENDLY THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS SO IN CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE INDIANS ON THE SOUND THAT I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT IT MEANT NO ONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE LOST HIS LIFE AT THE HANDS OF THE INDIANS THAT SEASON
3830-12535-0016 UNTIL I WAS HOARSE FROM THE VIOLENT EFFORT FINALLY WHILE SITTING THERE WONDERING WHAT TO DO I SPIED A BLUE SMOKE ARISING FROM A CABIN ON THE OTHER SIDE SOON AFTER I SAW A MAN HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO MY RENEWED EFFORTS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
3830-12535-0017 THE TROUBLE HAD BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ALL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY MORNING EXPENDING MY BREATH FOR NOTHING THE MAN WAS SHIRLEY ENSIGN OF OLYMPIA WHO HAD ESTABLISHED A FERRY ACROSS THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND HAD LINGERED TO SET OVER BELATED IMMIGRANTS IF ANY SHOULD COME ALONG
3830-12535-0018 AND HAD MET MY PEOPLE THEY WERE CAMPED SOME THIRTY MILES AWAY HE THOUGHT
3830-12535-0019 BUT I COULD NOT WAIT THERE FOR THEM
3830-12535-0020 DETERMINED TO REACH CAMP THAT NIGHT IF I COULD POSSIBLY DO SO
3830-12535-0021 DUSK CAME ON AND STILL NO SIGNS THEN I SPIED SOME CATTLE GRAZING ON THE UPLAND AND SOON CAME UPON THE CAMP IN A RAVINE THAT HAD SHUT IT FROM VIEW REJOICING AND OUTBURSTS OF GRIEF FOLLOWED I INQUIRED FOR MY MOTHER THE FIRST THING
3830-12535-0022 SHE WAS NOT THERE MONTHS BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE SANDS OF THE PLATTE VALLEY MY YOUNGER BROTHER ALSO LAY BURIED ON THE PLAINS NEAR INDEPENDENCE ROCK
3830-12535-0023 WHEN WE CAME TO CONSIDER HOW THE PARTY SHOULD PROCEED I ADVISED THE OVER MOUNTAIN TRIP BUT I CAUTIONED THEM TO EXPECT SOME SNOW AND MUCH HARD WORK HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE THEY ASKED ABOUT THREE WEEKS THIS BROUGHT DISAPPOINTMENT
3830-12535-0024 THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THROUGH WITH THE JOURNEY YOU CAME TO STAY WITH US DIDN'T YOU I WANT TO BUT WHAT ABOUT MY WIFE AND THE TWO BABIES AT THE ISLAND FATHER SAID SOME ONE MUST GO AND LOOK AFTER THEM SO OLIVER WAS SENT AHEAD
3830-12535-0025 WHILE I WAS TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND HELP THE IMMIGRANTS THROUGH THE NATCHESS PASS IN OUR TRAIN WERE FIFTY OR MORE HEAD OF STOCK SEVEN WAGONS AND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE WE MADE THE TRIP ACROSS THE DIVIDE IN TWENTY TWO DAYS WITHOUT SERIOUS MISHAP OR LOSS
3830-12535-0026 THAT BESET OUR WAY AT EVERY STEP EVERY MAN LITERALLY PUT HIS SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL WE WERE COMPELLED OFTEN TO TAKE HOLD OF THE WHEELS TO BOOST THE WAGONS OVER THE LOGS OR TO EASE THEM DOWN STEEP PLACES
3830-12535-0027 ONE MAN TO EACH WAGON TO DRIVE FOUR TO ACT AS WHEELMEN FATHER AND THE WOMEN ON FOOT OR HORSEBACK TO DRIVE THE STOCK GOD BLESS THE WOMEN FOLKS OF THE PLAINS NOBLER BRAVER MORE UNCOMPLAINING SOULS WERE NEVER KNOWN
3830-12535-0028 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME ONE OUGHT TO WRITE A JUST TRIBUTE TO THEIR VALOR AND PATIENCE A BOOK OF THEIR HEROIC DEEDS ONE DAY WE ENCOUNTERED A NEWLY FALLEN TREE COCKED UP ON ITS OWN UPTURNED ROOTS FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND GO AROUND IT WE COULD NOT
3830-12535-0029 TO CUT IT OUT WITH OUR DULLED FLIMSY SAW SEEMED AN ENDLESS TASK DIG DOWN BOYS SAID FATHER AND IN SHORT ORDER EVERY AVAILABLE SHOVEL WAS OUT OF THE WAGONS VERY SOON THE WAY WAS OPEN FULLY FOUR FEET DEEP AND OXEN AND WAGONS PASSED UNDER THE OBSTRUCTION
3830-12535-0030 DO YOU SAY THAT WE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIPS THAT DEPENDS UPON THE POINT OF VIEW AS TO THIS RETURN TRIP I CAN TRULY SAY FOR MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT ONE OF HARDSHIP I ENJOYED OVERCOMING THE DIFFICULTIES AND SO DID THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE COMPANY
3830-12535-0031 BUT BETTER FOOD WAS OBTAINABLE AND THE GOAL WAS NEAR AT HAND IT WAS A POSITIVE PLEASURE THEREFORE TO PASS OVER THE MILES ONE BY ONE
3830-12535-0032 WHEN OUR LITTLE TRAIN AT LAST EMERGED FROM THE FORESTS AND CAME OUT INTO THE NISQUALLY PLAINS
3830-12535-0033 SO MARKED WAS THE CONTRAST HUNDREDS OF CATTLE SHEEP AND HORSES WERE QUIETLY GRAZING SCATTERED OVER THE LANDSCAPE AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE
3857-180923-0000 THE PRECEDING PAGES HAVE OUTLINED THE CAREER OF THE SECOND CONNECTICUT HEAVY ARTILLERY AND HAVE NARRATED SOME OF THE MORE MEMORABLE EVENTS OF ITS HISTORY ENOUGH HAS BEEN TOLD OF WHAT IT DID TO FURNISH GROUNDS FOR DEDUCING WHAT IT WAS
3857-180923-0001 BUT TO DEAL WITH THE REGIMENT ON THE PERSONAL SIDE IS HARDLY POSSIBLE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF SUCH A SKETCH AS THIS THOUGH IT IS A MATTER THAT CANNOT BE ENTIRELY PASSED BY
3857-180923-0002 MADE UP THE ORGANIZATION WHOSE NOT UNEVENTFUL EXISTENCE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED THAT THEY WERE BETTER MEN OR WORSE BRAVER MEN OR MORE PATRIOTIC THAN THEIR DESCENDANTS AND SUCCESSORS WOULD PROVE UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS
3857-180923-0003 OR THAN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEIR CONTEMPORARIES WHO DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE SAME SERVICE IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED YET TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH SUCH EXPERIENCES AS HAVE BEEN RECOUNTED WHICH BECAME FOR THEM FOR A TIME THE COMMONPLACES OF EVERY DAY LIFE
3857-180923-0004 IS ENOUGH TO PLACE THEM APART FROM ORDINARY MEN IN THE EYES OF OUR PEACE KNOWING GENERATION IN FACT TO HAVE PASSED THE TESTS OF SO FIERCE A COURSE OF EDUCATION GIVES THEM A TITLE TO A PLACE THUS APART THE UNIVERSITY MAN OF TO DAY
3857-180923-0005 AS THE BURDEN OF THE BACCALAUREATE SERMONS SO FREQUENTLY TESTIFIES IS CONSIGNED TO A SPECIAL PLACE OF RESPONSIBILITY IN LIFE BECAUSE OF HIS TRAINING THESE MEN SURELY EARNED ONE OF SPECIAL HONOR BY REASON OF THEIRS WHICH WAS TOO
3857-180923-0006 NOT LIKE THE OTHER PREPARATION ALONE BUT ALSO FULFILMENT THE REALIZATION OF HOW TYPICAL IT ALL WAS OF THAT GENERATION AND THAT TIME BRINGS THE CLEAREST UNDERSTANDING OF THE REAL SCOPE OF THE CIVIL WAR
3857-180923-0007 A NUMBER OF THE OFFICERS AND MEN WERE COLLEGE GRADUATES WHEN THEY ENLISTED AND OTHERS GAINED DEGREES AFTER THE WAR ENDED THE LIST WHICH FOLLOWS IS HOWEVER NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE IN FACT AN ABSOLUTELY CORRECT LIST IS NO DOUBT HOPELESSLY IMPOSSIBLE
3857-180923-0008 AND WAS ENLISTED AS CAPTAIN OF A COMPANY WHICH HE HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN RECRUITING LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SMITH OF WOODBURY ENTERED THE YALE LAW SCHOOL IN THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE BUT DID NOT GRADUATE
3857-180923-0009 ILL HEALTH FORCED HIM TO RELINQUISH HIS COMMISSION EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR AND UNTIL HIS DEATH IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE WAS A LEADING CITIZEN OF THE COUNTY JUDGE AUGUSTUS H FENN MAJOR AND BREVET COLONEL
3857-180923-0010 CAME BACK FROM THE WAR HAVING LOST AN ARM AT CEDAR CREEK TO TAKE A COURSE IN THE LAW SCHOOL AT HARVARD AND YALE MADE HIM A MASTER OF ARTS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE HIS PROMINENCE FOR MANY YEARS IN PUBLIC LIFE AND AS JUDGE IN THE HIGHEST COURTS IN THE STATE IS WELL KNOWN
3857-180923-0011 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH IN EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN HE WAS A LECTURER IN THE YALE LAW SCHOOL AND MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ERRORS
3857-180923-0012 CAPTAIN AND BREVET MAJOR WAS A GRADUATE OF WILLIAMS IN THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN HE WAS PASTOR OF THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH AT EAST CANAAN WHEN THE REGIMENT WAS ORGANIZED AND WAS ONE OF ITS RECRUITING OFFICERS ADJUTANT THEODORE F VAILL
3857-180923-0013 THE HISTORIAN OF THE REGIMENT WAS A STUDENT BEFORE THE WAR AT UNION COLLEGE BUT DID NOT GRADUATE CAPTAIN GEORGE S WILLIAMS OF NEW MILFORD WAS A MEMBER OF THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO AT YALE FOR A TIME
3857-180923-0014 AND RECEIVED A DEGREE FROM TRINITY IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE SURGEON HENRY PLUMB AND ASSISTANT SURGEONS ROBERT G HAZZARD AND JOHN W LAWTON WERE ALL GRADUATES OF THE YALE MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE CLASSES OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
3857-180923-0015 AND AFTER THE WAR WAS FOR SOME YEARS RECTOR OF SAINT JOHN'S CHURCH IN SALISBURY HE WAS LATER CONNECTED WITH A CHURCH COLLEGE IN MISSOURI WHERE HE DIED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT
3857-180923-0016 STUDIED AFTER THE WAR AT THE BERKELEY DIVINITY SCHOOL AND HAS BEEN FOR MANY YEARS RECTOR OF SAINT JOHN'S CHURCH IN BRIDGEPORT LIEUTENANT AND BREVET CAPTAIN LEWIS W MUNGER
3857-180923-0017 SERGEANT THEODORE C GLAZIER WAS A GRADUATE OF TRINITY IN THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY AND WAS A TUTOR THERE WHEN HE ENLISTED HE WAS LATER MADE COLONEL OF A COLORED REGIMENT AND SERVED WITH CREDIT IN THAT CAPACITY
3857-180923-0018 CORPORAL EDWARD C HOPSON A GRADUATE OF TRINITY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR WAS KILLED AT CEDAR CREEK SERGEANT GARWOOD R MERWIN WHO HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR AT YALE
3857-180923-0019 COLONEL MACKENZIE GRADUATED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO BUT HE WAS NEVER A RESIDENT OF THE COUNTY OR OF CONNECTICUT AND HIS ONLY CONNECTION WITH EITHER WAS THROUGH HIS COMMISSION FROM GOVERNOR BUCKINGHAM
3857-180923-0020 THERE ARE NOT A FEW OTHER NAMES UPON THE ROLLS OF THE REGIMENT WHICH UPON MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAN HAS BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT CASE WOULD CERTAINLY BE ADDED TO THE LIST
3857-180923-0021 A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION WOULD ALSO GIVE A LARGE PLACE TO THE ASSOCIATION OF ITS VETERANS FORMED SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR WHOSE FREQUENT GATHERINGS HAVE MORE THAN A SUPERFICIAL LIKENESS TO THE REUNIONS OF COLLEGE CLASSES
3857-180923-0022 MEMORABLE AMONG THESE MEETINGS WAS THE ONE HELD ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX THE OCCASION BEING THE DEDICATION OF THE REGIMENT'S MONUMENT IN THE NATIONAL CEMETERY AT ARLINGTON
3857-180923-0023 AS A WHOLE THE REGIMENT WAS A BODY THOROUGHLY REPRESENTATIVE NOT ONLY OF THE ARMY OF WHICH IT WAS A FRACTION AN ARMY AS HAS BEEN OFTEN SAID UNLIKE ANY OTHER THE WORLD HAS KNOWN BUT ALSO OF THE POPULATION FROM WHICH IT WAS DRAWN
3857-180923-0024 IT WAS MADE UP OF MEN OF ALMOST ALL CONDITIONS OF LIFE AND OF WIDELY DIFFERENT AGES THOUGH NATURALLY WITH YOUNG MEN IN A LARGE MAJORITY OF MECHANICS FROM THE HOUSATONIC AND NAUGATUCK VALLEYS AND FARMERS BOYS FROM THE HILLS OF MEN OF EDUCATION AND MEN OF NONE
3857-180923-0025 THOUGH THE LARGE ADDITION TO ITS NUMBERS WHICH THE INCREASE IN SIZE NECESSITATED MADE IT PERHAPS SOMEWHAT LESS HOMOGENEOUS THAN AT FIRST IT DID NOT GREATLY ALTER ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS
3857-180923-0026 THE RECORDS KEPT BY THE ASSOCIATION REFERRED TO FURNISH SUGGESTIVE REVELATIONS AS TO THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS THAT COMPOSED IT THE NAMES OF MEN OF EVERY SORT AND KIND ARE FOUND UPON THE ROLLS THERE WERE VETERANS OF THE MEXICAN WAR
3857-180923-0027 THERE WERE REFUGEES FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY UPRISINGS IN EUROPE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT THERE WERE SOME WHO HAD SERVED UNDER COMPULSION IN THE ARMIES OF THE SOUTH THERE WERE MEN WHOSE OBVIOUSLY FICTITIOUS NAMES CONCEALED STORIES WHICH COULD BE GUESSED TO BE EXTRAORDINARY
3857-180923-0028 THERE WERE NAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS AMONG THE BEST KNOWN AND MOST HONORED IN THIS STATE AND THERE WERE THOSE OF OUTCASTS AND WRECKS A LARGE PART OF THESE MEN CAME BACK AFTER THEIR SERVICE ENDED TO RESUME THE PEACEFUL LIFE OF CITIZENSHIP
3857-180923-0029 AND EVERY TOWN AMONG US HAS KNOWN SOME OF THEM EVER SINCE AMONG ITS LEADING FIGURES WHILE SOME IN QUARTERS FAR DISTANT HAVE ALSO ATTAINED TO HONORS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE RECORDS SHOW
3857-182315-0000 HOW I HATE THE MAN WHO TALKS ABOUT THE BRUTE CREATION WITH AN UGLY EMPHASIS ON BRUTE AS FOR ME I AM PROUD OF MY CLOSE KINSHIP WITH OTHER ANIMALS
3857-182315-0001 I TAKE A JEALOUS PRIDE IN MY SIMIAN ANCESTRY I LIKE TO THINK THAT I WAS ONCE A MAGNIFICENT HAIRY FELLOW LIVING IN THE TREES AND THAT MY FRAME HAS COME DOWN THROUGH GEOLOGICAL TIME VIA SEA JELLY AND WORMS
3857-182315-0002 AND AMPHIOXUS FISH DINOSAURS AND APES WHO WOULD EXCHANGE THESE FOR THE PALLID COUPLE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN W N P BARBELLION
3857-182315-0003 LAST SUNDAY POTTER TOOK ME OUT DRIVING ALONG UPPER BROADWAY WHERE THOSE LONG ROWS OF TALL NEW APARTMENT HOUSES WERE BUILT A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS A MILD AFTERNOON AND GREAT CROWDS OF PEOPLE WERE OUT
3857-182315-0004 SUNDAY AFTERNOON CROWDS THEY WERE NOT GOING ANYWHERE THEY WERE JUST STROLLING UP AND DOWN STARING AT EACH OTHER AND TALKING THERE WERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THEM
3857-182315-0005 I TURNED AND ASKED WHY WHAT ABOUT THEM I WASN'T SURE WHETHER HE HAD AN IDEA OR A HEADACHE OTHER CREATURES DON'T DO IT HE REPLIED WITH A DISCOURAGED EXPRESSION
3857-182315-0006 ARE ANY OTHER BEINGS EVER FOUND IN SUCH MASSES BUT VERMIN AIMLESS STARING VACANT MINDED LOOK AT THEM
3857-182315-0007 I CAN GET NO SENSE WHATEVER OF INDIVIDUAL WORTH OR OF VALUE IN MEN AS A RACE WHEN I SEE THEM LIKE THIS IT MAKES ONE ALMOST DESPAIR OF CIVILIZATION I THOUGHT THIS OVER FOR AWHILE
3857-182315-0008 AND YET AT OTHER TIMES I TOO FEEL LIKE A SPECTATOR AN ALIEN BUT EVEN THEN I HAD NEVER FELT SO ALIEN OR DESPAIRING AS POTTER LET'S REMEMBER I SAID IT'S A SIMIAN CIVILIZATION
3857-182315-0009 POTTER WAS STARING DISGUSTEDLY AT SOME VAUDEVILLE SIGN BOARDS YES I SAID THOSE FOR EXAMPLE ARE DISTINCTIVELY SIMIAN WHY SHOULD YOU FEEL DISAPPOINTMENT AT SOMETHING INEVITABLE AND I WENT ON TO ARGUE THAT IT WASN'T AS THOUGH WE WERE DESCENDED FROM
3857-182315-0010 EAGLES FOR INSTANCE INSTEAD OF BROADLY SPEAKING FROM APE LIKE OR MONKEYISH BEINGS BEING OF SIMIAN STOCK WE HAD SIMIAN TRAITS OUR DEVELOPMENT NATURALLY BORE THE MARKS OF OUR ORIGIN
3857-182315-0011 WHAT COULD YOU EXPECT TWO IF WE HAD BEEN MADE DIRECTLY FROM CLAY THE WAY IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE AND HAD THEREFORE INHERITED NO INTERMEDIATE CHARACTERISTICS
3857-182315-0012 IF A GOD OR SOME PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH HAD GONE THAT WAY TO WORK WITH US HE OR IT MIGHT HAVE MOLDED US IN MUCH MORE SPLENDID FORMS BUT CONSIDERING OUR SIMIAN DESCENT IT HAS DONE VERY WELL
3857-182315-0013 THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE DISAPPOINTED IN US ARE THOSE WHO STILL BELIEVE THAT CLAY STORY OR WHO UNCONSCIOUSLY STILL LET IT COLOR THEIR THINKING THERE CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE A POWER AT WORK IN THE WORLD
3857-182315-0014 BY VIRTUE OF WHICH EVERY LIVING THING GROWS AND DEVELOPS AND IT TENDS TOWARD SPLENDOR SEEDS BECOME TREES AND WEAK LITTLE NATIONS GROW GREAT BUT THE PUSH OR THE FORCE THAT IS DOING THIS THE YEAST AS IT WERE
3857-182315-0015 HAS TO WORK IN AND ON CERTAIN DEFINITE KINDS OF MATERIAL BECAUSE THIS YEAST IS IN US THERE MAY BE GREAT AND UNDREAMED OF POSSIBILITIES AWAITING MANKIND BUT BECAUSE OF OUR LINE OF DESCENT
3857-182315-0016 THERE ARE ALSO QUEER LIMITATIONS THREE IN THOSE DISTANT INVISIBLE EPOCHS BEFORE MEN EXISTED BEFORE EVEN THE PROUD MISSING LINK STRUTTED AROUND THROUGH THE WOODS
3857-182315-0017 LITTLE REALIZING HOW WE HIS GREATGRANDSONS WOULD SMILE WRYLY AT HIM MUCH AS OUR OWN DESCENDANTS MAY SHUDDER AT US AGES HENCE THE VARIOUS ANIMALS WERE DESPERATELY COMPETING FOR POWER THEY COULDN'T OR DIDN'T LIVE AS EQUALS
3857-182315-0018 CERTAIN GROUPS SOUGHT THE HEADSHIP MANY STRANGE FORGOTTEN DYNASTIES ROSE MET DEFIANCE AND FELL IN THE END IT WAS OUR ANCESTORS WHO WON AND BECAME SIMIAN KINGS AND BEQUEATHED A WHOLE PLANET TO US
3857-182315-0019 AND KEPT US IN CAGES OR SHOW US FOR SPORT IN THE FOREST WHILE THEY RULED THE WORLD SO POTTER AND I DEVELOPING THIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT BEGAN TO IMAGINE WE HAD LIVED MANY AGES AGO AND SOMEHOW OR OTHER HAD ALIGHTED HERE FROM SOME OLDER PLANET
3857-182315-0020 FAMILIAR WITH THE WAYS OF EVOLUTION ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE WE NATURALLY SHOULD HAVE WONDERED WHAT COURSE IT WOULD TAKE ON THIS EARTH EVEN IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE COSMOS WE MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED AND ON THIS TINY STAR
3857-182315-0021 IT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO CONSIDER THE TREND OF EVENTS WE SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO APPRAISE THE DIFFERENT SPECIES AS THEY WANDERED AROUND EACH WITH ITS OWN SET OF GOOD AND BAD CHARACTERISTICS WHICH GROUP WE'D HAVE WONDERED WOULD EVER CONTRIVE TO RULE ALL THE REST
3857-182315-0022 AND HOW GREAT A DEVELOPMENT COULD THEY ATTAIN TO THEREAFTER
3857-182315-0023 WE MIGHT FIRST HAVE CONSIDERED THE LEMURS OR APES THEY HAD HANDS AESTHETICALLY VIEWED THE POOR SIMIANS WERE SIMPLY GROTESQUE BUT TRAVELERS WHO KNEW OTHER PLANETS MIGHT HAVE KNOWN WHAT BEAUTY MAY SPRING FROM AN UNCOUTH BEGINNING IN THIS MAGIC UNIVERSE
3857-182315-0024 STILL THOSE FROWSY UNLOVELY HORDES OF APES AND MONKEYS WERE SO COMPLETELY LACKING IN SIGNS OF KINGSHIP THEY WERE SO FLIGHTY TOO IN THEIR WAYS AND HAD SO LITTLE PURPOSE AND SO MUCH LOVE FOR ABSURD AND IDLE CHATTER
3857-182315-0025 THEY ARE NOT EASILY LEFT BEHIND EVEN AFTER LONG STAGES AND THEY FORM A TERRIBLE OBSTACLE TO ALL HIGH ADVANCEMENT
3857-182315-0026 THE BEES OR THE ANTS MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO US MORE PROMISING THEIR SMALLNESS OF SIZE WAS NOT NECESSARILY TOO MUCH OF A HANDICAP THEY COULD HAVE MADE POISON THEIR WEAPON FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF RIVALS
3857-182315-0027 AND IN THESE ORDERLY INSECTS THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY A CAPACITY FOR LABOR AND CO OPERATIVE LABOR AT THAT WHICH COULD CARRY THEM FAR WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A MARKED GENIUS GREAT GIFTS OF THEIR OWN
3857-182315-0028 IN A CIVILIZATION OF SUPER ANTS OR BEES THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO PROBLEM OF THE HUNGRY UNEMPLOYED NO POVERTY NO UNSTABLE GOVERNMENT NO RIOTS NO STRIKES FOR SHORT HOURS
3857-182315-0029 NO DERISION OF EUGENICS NO THIEVES PERHAPS NO CRIME AT ALL ANTS ARE GOOD CITIZENS THEY PLACE GROUP INTERESTS FIRST BUT THEY CARRY IT SO FAR THEY HAVE FEW OR NO POLITICAL RIGHTS
3857-182315-0030 AN ANT DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTE APPARENTLY HE JUST HAS HIS DUTIES THIS QUALITY MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR HAVING GROUPS WARS THE EGOTISM OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL SPIRITS IS ALLOWED SCANT EXPRESSION
3857-182315-0031 SO THE EGOTISM OF THE GROUPS IS EXTREMELY FEROCIOUS AND ACTIVE IS THIS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY ANTS FIGHT SO MUCH WE HAVE SEEN THE SAME PHENOMENON OCCUR IN CERTAIN NATIONS OF MEN AND THE ANTS COMMIT ATROCITIES IN AND AFTER THEIR BATTLES THAT ARE
3857-182315-0032 I WISH I COULD TRULY SAY INHUMAN BUT CONVERSELY ANTS ARE ABSOLUTELY UNSELFISH WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THEY ARE SKILFUL INGENIOUS THEIR NESTS AND BUILDINGS ARE RELATIVELY LARGER THAN MAN'S
3857-182315-0033 THE SCIENTISTS SPEAK OF THEIR PAVED STREETS VAULTED HALLS THEIR HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS THEIR PLUCK AND INTELLIGENCE THEIR INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE THEIR CHASTE AND INDUSTRIOUS LIVES
3857-182315-0034 DARWIN SAID THE ANT'S BRAIN WAS ONE OF THE MOST MARVELOUS ATOMS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS MORE SO THAN THE BRAIN OF MAN YES OF PRESENT DAY MAN WHO FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS HAS HAD SO MUCH MORE CHANCE TO DEVELOP HIS BRAIN
3857-182315-0035 A THOUGHTFUL OBSERVER WOULD HAVE WEIGHED ALL THESE EXCELLENT QUALITIES WHEN WE THINK OF THESE CREATURES AS LITTLE MEN WHICH IS ALL WRONG OF COURSE WE SEE THEY HAVE THEIR FAULTS TO OUR EYES THEY SEEM TOO ORDERLY FOR INSTANCE
3857-182315-0036 REPRESSIVELY SO THEIR WAYS ARE MORE FIXED THAN THOSE OF THE OLD EGYPTIANS AND THEIR INDUSTRY IS PAINFUL TO THINK OF IT'S HYPER CHINESE BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THIS IS A SIMIAN COMMENT
3857-182315-0037 THE INSTINCTS OF THE SPECIES THAT YOU AND I BELONG TO ARE OF AN OPPOSITE KIND AND THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR US TO JUDGE ANTS FAIRLY BUT WE AND THE ANTS ARE ALIKE IN ONE MATTER THE STRONG LOVE OF PROPERTY
3857-182315-0038 AND INSTEAD OF MERELY STRUGGLING WITH NATURE FOR IT THEY ALSO FIGHT OTHER ANTS THE CUSTOM OF PLUNDER SEEMS TO BE A PART OF MOST OF THEIR WARS THIS HAS GONE ON FOR AGES AMONG THEM AND CONTINUES TODAY
3857-182315-0039 RAIDS FEROCIOUS COMBATS AND LOOT ARE PART OF AN ANT'S REGULAR LIFE ANT REFORMERS IF THERE WERE ANY MIGHT LAY THIS TO THEIR PROPERTY SENSE AND TALK OF ABOLISHING PROPERTY AS A CURE FOR THE EVIL
3857-182315-0040 BUT THAT WOULD NOT HELP FOR LONG UNLESS THEY COULD ABOLISH THE LOVE OF IT ANTS SEEM TO CARE EVEN MORE FOR PROPERTY THAN WE DO OURSELVES WE MEN ARE INCLINED TO EASE UP A LITTLE WHEN WE HAVE ALL WE NEED
3857-182315-0041 THEY CAN'T BEAR TO STOP THEY KEEP RIGHT ON WORKING THIS MEANS THAT ANTS DO NOT CONTEMPLATE THEY HEED NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN LITTLE ROUNDS IT IS ALMOST AS THOUGH THEIR FONDNESS FOR LABOR HAD CLOSED FAST THEIR MINDS
3857-182315-0042 CONCEIVABLY THEY MIGHT HAVE DEVELOPED INQUIRING MINDS BUT THIS WOULD HAVE RUN AGAINST THEIR STRONGEST INSTINCTS THE ANT IS KNOWING AND WISE BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW ENOUGH TO TAKE A VACATION
3857-182315-0043 WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE THEREWITH TO RULE THEIR INSTINCTS OR TO STOP WORK LONG ENOUGH TO EXAMINE THEMSELVES OR THE UNIVERSE OR TO DREAM OF ANY NOBLE DEVELOPMENT PROBABLY NOT REASON IS SELDOM OR NEVER THE RULER
3857-182315-0044 IT IS THE SERVANT OF INSTINCT IT WOULD THEREFORE HAVE TOLD THE ANTS THAT INCESSANT TOIL WAS USEFUL AND GOOD TOIL HAS BROUGHT YOU UP FROM THE RUCK OF THINGS REASON WOULD HAVE PLAUSIBLY SAID
3857-182315-0045 IT'S BY VIRTUE OF FEVERISH TOIL THAT YOU HAVE BECOME WHAT YOU ARE BEING ENDLESSLY INDUSTRIOUS IS THE BEST ROAD FOR YOU TO THE HEIGHTS
3857-182317-0000 SOME HAD OVER TRUSTFUL CHARACTERS LIKE THE SEALS OR EXPLOITABLE CHARACTERS LIKE COWS AND CHICKENS AND SHEEP SUCH CREATURES SENTENCE THEMSELVES TO BE CAPTIVES BY THEIR LACK OF AMBITION DOGS THEY HAVE MORE SPIRIT
3857-182317-0001 BUT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR CHANCE OF KINGSHIP THROUGH WORSHIPPING US THE DOG'S FINER QUALITIES CAN'T BE PRAISED TOO WARMLY THERE IS A PURITY ABOUT HIS DEVOTION WHICH MAKES MERE MEN FEEL SPEECHLESS BUT WITH ALL LOVE FOR DOGS
3857-182317-0002 ONE MUST GRANT THEY ARE VASSALS NOT RULERS THEY ARE TOO PARASITIC THE ONE WILLING SERVANT CLASS OF THE WORLD AND WE HAVE BETRAYED THEM BY MAKING UNDER SIMIANS OF THEM
3857-182317-0003 LOVING US THEY LET US STOP THEIR DEVELOPING IN TUNE WITH THEIR NATURES AND THEY'VE PATIENTLY TRIED EVER SINCE TO ADOPT WAYS OF OURS THEY HAVE DONE IT TOO BUT OF COURSE THEY CAN'T GET FAR IT'S NOT THEIR OWN ROAD
3857-182317-0004 DOGS HAVE MORE LOVE THAN INTEGRITY THEY'VE BEEN TRUE TO US YES BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TRUE TO THEMSELVES PIGS THE PIG IS REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT AND BRAVE BUT HE'S GROSS
3857-182317-0005 AND GROSSNESS DELAYS ONE'S ACHIEVEMENT IT TAKES SO MUCH TIME THE SNAKE TOO THOUGH WISE HAS A WAY OF EATING HIMSELF INTO STUPORS IF SUPER SNAKE MEN HAD HAD BANQUETS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO VAST TO DESCRIBE
3857-182317-0006 AND WELL SHOULD THE ELEPHANT KNOW IT HE HAD THE BEST CHANCE OF ALL WISER EVEN THAN THE LION OR THE WISEST OF APES HIS WISDOM FURTHERMORE WAS BENIGN WHERE THEIRS WAS SINISTER CONSIDER HIS DIGNITY HIS POISE AND SKILL
3857-182317-0007 HE WAS PLASTIC TOO HE HAD LEARNED TO EAT MANY FOODS AND ENDURE MANY CLIMATES ONCE SOME SAY THIS RACE EXPLORED THE GLOBE THEIR BONES ARE FOUND EVERYWHERE IN SOUTH AMERICA EVEN
3857-182317-0008 SO THE ELEPHANTS COLUMBUS MAY HAVE FOUND SOME ROAD HERE BEFORE OURS THEY ARE COSMOPOLITANS THESE SUAVE AND WELL BRED BEINGS THEY HAVE RICH EMOTIONAL NATURES LONG MEMORIES LOYALTY THEY ARE STEADY AND SURE
3857-182317-0009 AND NOT NARROW NOT SELF ABSORBED FOR THEY SEEM INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING WHAT WAS IT THEN THAT PUT THEM OUT OF THE RACE COULD IT HAVE BEEN A QUITE NATURAL BELIEF THAT THEY HAD ALREADY WON AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY HADN'T
3857-182317-0010 AND THAT THE MONKEY MEN WERE GETTING AHEAD WERE THEY TOO GREAT MINDED AND DECENT TO EXTERMINATE THEIR PUNY RIVALS IT MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR TOLERANCE AND PATIENCE THAT BETRAYED THEM THEY WAIT TOO LONG BEFORE THEY RESENT AN IMPOSITION OR INSULT
3857-182317-0011 JUST AS ANTS ARE TOO ENERGETIC AND CATS TOO SHREWD FOR THEIR OWN HIGHEST GOOD SO THE ELEPHANTS SUFFER FROM TOO MUCH PATIENCE THEIR EXHIBITIONS OF IT MAY SEEM SUPERB SUCH POWER AND SUCH RESTRAINT COMBINED ARE NOBLE
3857-182317-0012 MORE LIVE AND LET LIVE IN ALLOWING OTHER SPECIES TO STAY HERE OUR WAY IS TO KILL GOOD AND BAD MALE AND FEMALE AND BABIES TILL THE FEW LAST SURVIVORS LIE HIDDEN AWAY FROM OUR GUNS
3857-182317-0013 ALL SPECIES MUST SURRENDER UNCONDITIONALLY THOSE ARE OUR TERMS AND COME AND LIVE IN BARNS ALONGSIDE US OR ON US AS PARASITES THE CREATURES THAT WANT TO LIVE A LIFE OF THEIR OWN WE CALL WILD IF WILD
3857-182317-0014 THEN NO MATTER HOW HARMLESS WE TREAT THEM AS OUTLAWS AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE SPECIALLY WELL BROUGHT UP SHOOT THEM FOR FUN SOME MIGHT BE OUR FRIENDS WE DON'T WISH IT WE KEEP THEM ALL TERRORIZED
3857-182317-0015 WHEN ONE OF US CONQUERING MONKEY MEN ENTERS THE WOODS MOST ANIMALS THAT SCENT HIM SLINK AWAY OR RACE OFF IN A PANIC IT IS NOT THAT WE HAVE PLANNED THIS DELIBERATELY BUT THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE LIKE RACE BY RACE THEY HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED
3857-182317-0016 SOON ALL WILL BE GONE WE GIVE NEITHER FREEDOM NOR LIFE ROOM TO THOSE WE DEFEAT IF WE HAD BEEN AS STRONG AS THE ELEPHANTS WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KINDER WHEN GREAT POWER COMES NATURALLY TO PEOPLE
3857-182317-0017 IT IS USED MORE URBANELY WE USE IT AS PARVENUS DO BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE THE ELEPHANT BEING BORN TO IT IS EASY GOING CONFIDENT TOLERANT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE HUMANE KING
3857-182317-0018 THE ELEPHANT IS STUPID WHEN IT COMES TO LEARNING HOW TO USE TOOLS SO ARE ALL OTHER SPECIES EXCEPT OUR OWN ISN'T IT STRANGE A TOOL IN THE MOST PRIMITIVE SENSE IS ANY OBJECT LYING AROUND
3857-182317-0019 THAT CAN OBVIOUSLY BE USED AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THIS OR THAT PURPOSE MANY CREATURES USE OBJECTS AS MATERIALS AS BIRDS USE TWIGS FOR NESTS BUT THE STEP THAT NO ANIMAL TAKES IS LEARNING FREELY TO USE THINGS AS INSTRUMENTS
3857-182317-0020 WHEN AN ELEPHANT PLUCKS OFF A BRANCH AND SWISHES HIS FLANKS AND THUS KEEPS AWAY INSECTS HE IS USING A TOOL BUT HE DOES IT ONLY BY A VAGUE AND HAPHAZARD ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS IF HE ONCE BECAME A CONSCIOUS USER OF TOOLS
3857-182317-0021 HE WOULD OF COURSE GO MUCH FURTHER WE OURSELVES WHO ARE SO GOOD AT IT NOW WERE SLOW ENOUGH IN BEGINNING THINK OF THE LONG EPOCHS THAT PASSED BEFORE IT ENTERED OUR HEADS
3857-182317-0022 AND ALL THAT WHILE THE CONTEST FOR LEADERSHIP BLINDLY WENT ON WITHOUT ANY SPECIES MAKING USE OF THIS OBVIOUS AID THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED WAS SIMPLE THE REWARD WAS THE RULE OF A PLANET YET ONLY ONE SPECIES OUR OWN
3857-182317-0023 HAS EVER HAD THAT MUCH BRAINS IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT OTHER OBVIOUS LESSONS MAY STILL BE UNLEARNED IT IS NOT NECESSARILY STUPID HOWEVER TO FAIL TO USE TOOLS TO USE TOOLS INVOLVES USING REASON
3857-182317-0024 INSTEAD OF STICKING TO INSTINCT NOW STICKING TO INSTINCT HAS ITS DISADVANTAGES BUT SO HAS USING REASON WHICHEVER FACULTY YOU USE THE OTHER ATROPHIES AND PARTLY DESERTS YOU WE ARE TRYING TO USE BOTH
3857-182317-0025 BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHICH HAS THE MORE VALUE A SUDDEN VISION COMES TO ME OF ONE OF THE FIRST FAR AWAY APE MEN WHO TRIED TO USE REASON INSTEAD OF INSTINCT AS A GUIDE FOR HIS CONDUCT I IMAGINE HIM PERCHED IN HIS TREE
3857-182317-0026 TORN BETWEEN THOSE TWO VOICES WAILING LOUDLY AT NIGHT BY A RIVER IN HIS PUZZLED DISTRESS MY POOR FAR OFF BROTHER
3857-182317-0027 AND THEREAFTER ACHIEVE A HIGH CIVILIZATION BUT THAT WASN'T THE PROBLEM THE REAL PROBLEM
3857-182317-0028 SOME QUENCHLESS DESIRE TO URGE THEM ON AND ON AND ALSO ADAPTABILITY OF A THOUSAND KINDS TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT THE RHINOCEROS CARES LITTLE FOR ADAPTABILITY HE SLOGS THROUGH THE WORLD BUT WE
3857-182317-0029 WE ARE EXPERTS ADAPTABILITY IS WHAT WE DEPEND ON WE TALK OF OUR MASTERY OF NATURE WHICH SOUNDS VERY GRAND BUT THE FACT IS WE RESPECTFULLY ADAPT OURSELVES FIRST TO HER WAYS
3857-182317-0030 WE ATTAIN NO POWER OVER NATURE TILL WE LEARN NATURAL LAWS AND OUR LORDSHIP DEPENDS ON THE ADROITNESS WITH WHICH WE LEARN AND CONFORM ADROITNESS HOWEVER IS MERELY AN ABILITY TO WIN
3857-182317-0031 BACK OF IT THERE MUST BE SOME SPUR TO MAKE US USE OUR ADROITNESS WHY DON'T WE ALL DIE OR GIVE UP WHEN WE'RE SICK OF THE WORLD BECAUSE THE LOVE OF LIFE IS REENFORCED IN MOST ENERGIZED BEINGS
3857-182317-0032 BY SOME LONGING THAT PUSHES THEM FORWARD IN DEFEAT AND IN DARKNESS ALL CREATURES WISH TO LIVE AND TO PERPETUATE THEIR SPECIES OF COURSE BUT THOSE TWO WISHES ALONE EVIDENTLY DO NOT CARRY ANY RACE FAR
3857-182317-0033 IN ADDITION TO THESE A RACE TO BE GREAT NEEDS SOME HUNGER SOME ITCH TO SPUR IT UP THE HARD PATH WE LATELY HAVE LEARNED TO CALL EVOLUTION THE LOVE OF TOIL IN THE ANTS AND OF CRAFT IN CATS ARE EXAMPLES
403-126855-0000 THE SEVENTH CHAPTER
403-126855-0001 THE BRIDGE OF APES QUEEN ERMINTRUDE HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE SEEN HER HUSBAND SO TERRIBLE AS HE GOT THAT NIGHT HE GNASHED HIS TEETH WITH RAGE
403-126855-0002 HE CALLED EVERYBODY A FOOL HE THREW HIS TOOTH BRUSH AT THE PALACE CAT HE RUSHED ROUND IN HIS NIGHT SHIRT AND WOKE UP ALL HIS ARMY AND SENT THEM INTO THE JUNGLE TO CATCH THE DOCTOR
403-126855-0003 THEN HE MADE ALL HIS SERVANTS GO TOO HIS COOKS AND HIS GARDENERS AND HIS BARBER AND PRINCE BUMPO'S TUTOR EVEN THE QUEEN WHO WAS TIRED FROM DANCING IN A PAIR OF TIGHT SHOES
403-126855-0004 WAS PACKED OFF TO HELP THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR SEARCH ALL THIS TIME THE DOCTOR AND HIS ANIMALS WERE RUNNING THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARDS THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO GUB GUB
403-126855-0005 WITH HIS SHORT LEGS SOON GOT TIRED AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO CARRY HIM WHICH MADE IT PRETTY HARD WHEN THEY HAD THE TRUNK AND THE HAND BAG WITH THEM AS WELL THE KING OF THE JOLLIGINKI
403-126855-0006 THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR HIS ARMY TO FIND THEM BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WAS IN A STRANGE LAND AND WOULD NOT KNOW HIS WAY BUT HE WAS WRONG BECAUSE THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE KNEW ALL THE PATHS THROUGH THE JUNGLE BETTER EVEN THAN THE KING'S MEN DID
403-126855-0007 AND HE LED THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS TO THE VERY THICKEST PART OF THE FOREST A PLACE WHERE NO MAN HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE AND HID THEM ALL IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE BETWEEN HIGH ROCKS
403-126855-0008 SO THERE THEY STAYED THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH THEY OFTEN HEARD THE KING'S MEN SEARCHING AND TALKING IN THE JUNGLE ROUND ABOUT BUT THEY WERE QUITE SAFE FOR NO ONE KNEW OF THAT HIDING PLACE BUT CHEE CHEE NOT EVEN THE OTHER MONKEYS
403-126855-0009 AT LAST WHEN DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO COME THROUGH THE THICK LEAVES OVERHEAD THEY HEARD QUEEN ERMINTRUDE SAYING IN A VERY TIRED VOICE THAT IT WAS NO USE LOOKING ANY MORE THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AND GET SOME SLEEP
403-126855-0010 AND THEY SET OFF FOR THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS IT WAS A LONG LONG WAY AND THEY OFTEN GOT VERY TIRED ESPECIALLY GUB GUB BUT WHEN HE CRIED THEY GAVE HIM MILK OUT OF THE COCOANUTS
403-126855-0011 CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT THEY EVEN GOT THE DOCTOR SOME TOBACCO ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND WANTED TO SMOKE
403-126855-0012 AND ENJOYED THE LIFE OF TRAVEL VERY MUCH BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS GLAD WHEN THE NIGHT CAME AND THEY STOPPED FOR THEIR RESTING TIME THEN THE DOCTOR USED TO MAKE A LITTLE FIRE OF STICKS
403-126855-0013 THEY WOULD SIT ROUND IT IN A RING LISTENING TO POLYNESIA SINGING SONGS ABOUT THE SEA OR TO CHEE CHEE TELLING STORIES OF THE JUNGLE AND MANY OF THE TALES THAT CHEE CHEE TOLD WERE VERY INTERESTING
403-126855-0014 BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE MONKEYS HAD NO HISTORY BOOKS OF THEIR OWN BEFORE DOCTOR DOLITTLE CAME TO WRITE THEM FOR THEM THEY REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS BY TELLING STORIES TO THEIR CHILDREN
403-126855-0015 OF THE DAYS WHEN MEN DRESSED IN BEAR SKINS AND LIVED IN HOLES IN THE ROCK AND ATE THEIR MUTTON RAW BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT COOKING WAS HAVING NEVER SEEN A FIRE
403-126855-0016 AND HE TOLD THEM OF THE GREAT MAMMOTHS AND LIZARDS AS LONG AS A TRAIN THAT WANDERED OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN THOSE TIMES NIBBLING FROM THE TREE TOPS AND OFTEN THEY GOT SO INTERESTED LISTENING
403-126855-0017 THEY WERE STILL BEING FOLLOWED BY THE KING'S MEN IF CHEE CHEE HAD KNOWN THIS HE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE HIDDEN THEM AGAIN BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW IT ONE DAY CHEE CHEE CLIMBED UP A HIGH ROCK AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE TREE TOPS
403-126855-0018 THESE MONKEYS MADE A TREMENDOUS NOISE CHEERING AND WAVING LEAVES AND SWINGING OUT OF THE BRANCHES TO GREET HIM THEY WANTED TO CARRY HIS BAG AND HIS TRUNK AND EVERYTHING HE HAD AND ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES EVEN CARRIED GUB GUB
403-126855-0019 HAD HEARD THE NOISE OF THE MONKEYS CHEERING AND THEY AT LAST KNEW WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS AND HASTENED ON TO CATCH HIM THE BIG MONKEY CARRYING GUB GUB WAS COMING ALONG BEHIND SLOWLY
403-126855-0020 AND HE SAW THE CAPTAIN OF THE ARMY SNEAKING THROUGH THE TREES SO HE HURRIED AFTER THE DOCTOR AND TOLD HIM TO RUN THEN THEY ALL RAN HARDER THAN THEY HAD EVER RUN IN THEIR LIVES AND THE KING'S MEN
403-126855-0021 COMING AFTER THEM BEGAN TO RUN TOO AND THE CAPTAIN RAN HARDEST OF ALL THEN THE DOCTOR TRIPPED OVER HIS MEDICINE BAG AND FELL DOWN IN THE MUD AND THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT HE WOULD SURELY CATCH HIM THIS TIME
403-126855-0022 BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD VERY LONG EARS THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS VERY SHORT AND AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HOLD OF THE DOCTOR ONE OF HIS EARS CAUGHT FAST IN A TREE
403-126855-0023 BY THIS TIME THE DOCTOR HAD PICKED HIMSELF UP AND ON THEY WENT AGAIN RUNNING AND RUNNING AND CHEE CHEE SHOUTED IT'S ALL RIGHT WE HAVEN'T FAR TO GO NOW
403-126855-0024 BUT BEFORE THEY COULD GET INTO THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS THEY CAME TO A STEEP CLIFF WITH A RIVER FLOWING BELOW THIS WAS THE END OF THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI
403-126855-0025 AND THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE ACROSS THE RIVER AND JIP THE DOG LOOKED DOWN OVER THE EDGE OF THE STEEP STEEP CLIFF AND SAID GOLLY HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET ACROSS
403-126855-0026 OH DEAR SAID GUB GUB THE KING'S MEN ARE QUITE CLOSE NOW LOOK AT THEM I AM AFRAID WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN BACK TO PRISON AGAIN AND HE BEGAN TO WEEP
403-126855-0027 THEY'VE GOT THE CAPTAIN LOOSE AND HE'S COMING ON LIKE A DEER GET LIVELY
403-126855-0028 WAS A BRIDGE ALL READY FOR HIM MADE OF LIVING MONKEYS FOR WHILE HIS BACK WAS TURNED THE MONKEYS QUICK AS A FLASH HAD MADE THEMSELVES INTO A BRIDGE
403-126855-0029 AND THE BIG ONE SHOUTED TO THE DOCTOR WALK OVER WALK OVER ALL OF YOU HURRY GUB GUB WAS A BIT SCARED WALKING ON SUCH A NARROW BRIDGE AT THAT DIZZY HEIGHT
403-126855-0030 AND SO DID ALL OF THEM JOHN DOLITTLE WAS THE LAST TO CROSS AND JUST AS HE WAS GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUSHING UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THEN THEY SHOOK THEIR FISTS AND YELLED WITH RAGE
403-126855-0031 MANY GREAT EXPLORERS AND GRAY BEARDED NATURALISTS HAVE LAIN LONG WEEKS HIDDEN IN THE JUNGLE WAITING TO SEE THE MONKEYS DO THAT TRICK BUT WE NEVER LET A WHITE MAN GET A GLIMPSE OF IT BEFORE YOU ARE THE FIRST TO SEE THE FAMOUS BRIDGE OF APES
403-128339-0000 PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND DETERMINED JURY SAT EVERY DAY THEIR LISTS WENT FORTH EVERY EVENING
403-128339-0001 COME OUT AND LISTEN TO THE EVENING PAPER YOU INSIDE THERE CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY SO AT LAST BEGAN THE EVENING PAPER AT LA FORCE
403-128339-0002 CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY HAD REASON TO KNOW THE USAGE HE HAD SEEN HUNDREDS PASS AWAY SO
403-128339-0003 AND TWO HAD ALREADY BEEN GUILLOTINED AND FORGOTTEN THE LIST WAS READ IN THE VAULTED CHAMBER WHERE DARNAY HAD SEEN THE ASSOCIATED PRISONERS ON THE NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL EVERY ONE OF THOSE HAD PERISHED IN THE MASSACRE
403-128339-0004 EVERY HUMAN CREATURE HE HAD SINCE CARED FOR AND PARTED WITH HAD DIED ON THE SCAFFOLD THERE WERE HURRIED WORDS OF FAREWELL AND KINDNESS BUT THE PARTING WAS SOON OVER IT WAS THE INCIDENT OF EVERY DAY
403-128339-0005 AND A LITTLE CONCERT FOR THAT EVENING THEY CROWDED TO THE GRATES AND SHED TEARS THERE BUT TWENTY PLACES IN THE PROJECTED ENTERTAINMENTS HAD TO BE REFILLED AND THE TIME WAS AT BEST SHORT TO THE LOCK UP HOUR
403-128339-0006 WHEN THE COMMON ROOMS AND CORRIDORS WOULD BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE GREAT DOGS WHO KEPT WATCH THERE THROUGH THE NIGHT THE PRISONERS WERE FAR FROM INSENSIBLE OR UNFEELING THEIR WAYS AROSE OUT OF THE CONDITION OF THE TIME SIMILARLY
403-128339-0007 BUT A WILD INFECTION OF THE WILDLY SHAKEN PUBLIC MIND IN SEASONS OF PESTILENCE SOME OF US WILL HAVE A SECRET ATTRACTION TO THE DISEASE A TERRIBLE PASSING INCLINATION TO DIE OF IT
403-128339-0008 AND ALL OF US HAVE LIKE WONDERS HIDDEN IN OUR BREASTS ONLY NEEDING CIRCUMSTANCES TO EVOKE THEM THE PASSAGE TO THE CONCIERGERIE WAS SHORT AND DARK
403-128339-0009 THE NIGHT IN ITS VERMIN HAUNTED CELLS WAS LONG AND COLD NEXT DAY FIFTEEN PRISONERS WERE PUT TO THE BAR BEFORE CHARLES DARNAY'S NAME WAS CALLED ALL THE FIFTEEN WERE CONDEMNED
403-128339-0010 SOME DAGGERS SOME ATE AND DRANK AS THEY LOOKED ON MANY KNITTED AMONG THESE LAST WAS ONE WITH A SPARE PIECE OF KNITTING UNDER HER ARM AS SHE WORKED SHE WAS IN A FRONT ROW BY THE SIDE OF A MAN
403-128339-0011 BUT WHAT HE MOST NOTICED IN THE TWO FIGURES WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE POSTED AS CLOSE TO HIMSELF AS THEY COULD BE THEY NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM THEY SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR SOMETHING WITH A DOGGED DETERMINATION
403-128339-0012 AND THEY LOOKED AT THE JURY BUT AT NOTHING ELSE UNDER THE PRESIDENT SAT DOCTOR MANETTE IN HIS USUAL QUIET DRESS AS WELL AS THE PRISONER COULD SEE HE AND MISTER LORRY WERE THE ONLY MEN THERE UNCONNECTED WITH THE TRIBUNAL
403-128339-0013 WHO WORE THEIR USUAL CLOTHES AND HAD NOT ASSUMED THE COARSE GARB
403-128339-0014 WHOSE LIFE WAS FORFEIT TO THE REPUBLIC UNDER THE DECREE WHICH BANISHED ALL EMIGRANTS ON PAIN OF DEATH IT WAS NOTHING THAT THE DECREE BORE DATE SINCE HIS RETURN TO FRANCE THERE HE WAS AND THERE WAS THE DECREE
403-128339-0015 HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN FRANCE AND HIS HEAD WAS DEMANDED TAKE OFF HIS HEAD CRIED THE AUDIENCE AN ENEMY TO THE REPUBLIC THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO SILENCE THOSE CRIES
403-128339-0016 UNDOUBTEDLY IT WAS WAS HE NOT AN EMIGRANT THEN WHAT DID HE CALL HIMSELF NOT AN EMIGRANT HE HOPED WITHIN THE SENSE AND SPIRIT OF THE LAW WHY NOT THE PRESIDENT DESIRED TO KNOW
403-128339-0017 BECAUSE HE HAD VOLUNTARILY RELINQUISHED A TITLE THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND A STATION THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND HAD LEFT HIS COUNTRY HE SUBMITTED BEFORE THE WORD EMIGRANT IN THE PRESENT ACCEPTATION BY THE TRIBUNAL WAS IN USE
403-128339-0018 TO LIVE BY HIS OWN INDUSTRY IN ENGLAND RATHER THAN ON THE INDUSTRY OF THE OVERLADEN PEOPLE OF FRANCE WHAT PROOF HAD HE OF THIS HE HANDED IN THE NAMES OF TWO WITNESSES THEOPHILE GABELLE AND ALEXANDRE MANETTE
403-128339-0019 THE PRESIDENT REMINDED HIM TRUE BUT NOT AN ENGLISH WOMAN A CITIZENESS OF FRANCE YES BY BIRTH HER NAME AND FAMILY
403-128339-0020 LUCIE MANETTE ONLY DAUGHTER OF DOCTOR MANETTE THE GOOD PHYSICIAN WHO SITS THERE THIS ANSWER HAD A HAPPY EFFECT UPON THE AUDIENCE CRIES IN EXALTATION OF THE WELL KNOWN GOOD PHYSICIAN RENT THE HALL
403-128339-0021 ON THESE FEW STEPS OF HIS DANGEROUS WAY CHARLES DARNAY HAD SET HIS FOOT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR MANETTE'S REITERATED INSTRUCTIONS THE SAME CAUTIOUS COUNSEL DIRECTED EVERY STEP THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
403-128339-0022 AND HAD PREPARED EVERY INCH OF HIS ROAD THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHY HAD HE RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN HE DID AND NOT SOONER HE HAD NOT RETURNED SOONER HE REPLIED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS OF LIVING IN FRANCE SAVE THOSE HE HAD RESIGNED
403-128339-0023 WHEREAS IN ENGLAND HE LIVED BY GIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE HE HAD RETURNED WHEN HE DID ON THE PRESSING AND WRITTEN ENTREATY OF A FRENCH CITIZEN WHO REPRESENTED THAT HIS LIFE WAS ENDANGERED BY HIS ABSENCE
403-128339-0024 HE HAD COME BACK TO SAVE A CITIZEN'S LIFE AND TO BEAR HIS TESTIMONY AT WHATEVER PERSONAL HAZARD TO THE TRUTH WAS THAT CRIMINAL IN THE EYES OF THE REPUBLIC THE POPULACE CRIED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
403-128339-0025 NO AND THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO QUIET THEM WHICH IT DID NOT FOR THEY CONTINUED TO CRY NO
403-128339-0026 THE PRESIDENT REQUIRED THE NAME OF THAT CITIZEN THE ACCUSED EXPLAINED THAT THE CITIZEN WAS HIS FIRST WITNESS HE ALSO REFERRED WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE CITIZEN'S LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM AT THE BARRIER
403-128339-0027 BUT WHICH HE DID NOT DOUBT WOULD BE FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS THEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENT THE DOCTOR HAD TAKEN CARE THAT IT SHOULD BE THERE HAD ASSURED HIM THAT IT WOULD BE THERE
403-128339-0028 THAT IN THE PRESSURE OF BUSINESS IMPOSED ON THE TRIBUNAL BY THE MULTITUDE OF ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC WITH WHICH IT HAD TO DEAL HE HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY OVERLOOKED IN HIS PRISON OF THE ABBAYE IN FACT
403-128339-0029 BY THE SURRENDER OF THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY DOCTOR MANETTE WAS NEXT QUESTIONED HIS HIGH PERSONAL POPULARITY AND THE CLEARNESS OF HIS ANSWERS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION
403-128339-0030 BUT AS HE PROCEEDED AS HE SHOWED THAT THE ACCUSED WAS HIS FIRST FRIEND ON HIS RELEASE FROM HIS LONG IMPRISONMENT THAT THE ACCUSED HAD REMAINED IN ENGLAND ALWAYS FAITHFUL AND DEVOTED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND HIMSELF IN THEIR EXILE THAT
403-128339-0031 SO FAR FROM BEING IN FAVOUR WITH THE ARISTOCRAT GOVERNMENT THERE HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TRIED FOR HIS LIFE BY IT AS THE FOE OF ENGLAND AND FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES AS HE BROUGHT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO VIEW WITH THE GREATEST DISCRETION
403-128339-0032 AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD FORCE OF TRUTH AND EARNESTNESS THE JURY AND THE POPULACE BECAME ONE AT LAST WHEN HE APPEALED BY NAME TO MONSIEUR LORRY AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN THEN AND THERE PRESENT WHO LIKE HIMSELF
403-128339-0033 HAD BEEN A WITNESS ON THAT ENGLISH TRIAL AND COULD CORROBORATE HIS ACCOUNT OF IT THE JURY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD HEARD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY WERE READY WITH THEIR VOTES IF THE PRESIDENT WERE CONTENT TO RECEIVE THEM AT EVERY VOTE
403-128339-0034 THE JURYMEN VOTED ALOUD AND INDIVIDUALLY THE POPULACE SET UP A SHOUT OF APPLAUSE ALL THE VOICES WERE IN THE PRISONER'S FAVOUR AND THE PRESIDENT DECLARED HIM FREE
403-128339-0035 THEN BEGAN ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WITH WHICH THE POPULACE SOMETIMES GRATIFIED THEIR FICKLENESS OR THEIR BETTER IMPULSES TOWARDS GENEROSITY AND MERCY
403-128339-0036 OR WHICH THEY REGARDED AS SOME SET OFF AGAINST THEIR SWOLLEN ACCOUNT OF CRUEL RAGE NO MAN CAN DECIDE NOW TO WHICH OF THESE MOTIVES SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WERE REFERABLE IT IS PROBABLE TO A BLENDING OF ALL THE THREE
403-128339-0037 WITH THE SECOND PREDOMINATING NO SOONER WAS THE ACQUITTAL PRONOUNCED THAN TEARS WERE SHED AS FREELY AS BLOOD AT ANOTHER TIME AND SUCH FRATERNAL EMBRACES WERE BESTOWED UPON THE PRISONER BY AS MANY OF BOTH SEXES AS COULD RUSH AT HIM
403-128339-0038 THAT AFTER HIS LONG AND UNWHOLESOME CONFINEMENT HE WAS IN DANGER OF FAINTING FROM EXHAUSTION NONE THE LESS BECAUSE HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE VERY SAME PEOPLE CARRIED BY ANOTHER CURRENT WOULD HAVE RUSHED AT HIM WITH THE VERY SAME INTENSITY
403-128339-0039 TO REND HIM TO PIECES AND STREW HIM OVER THE STREETS HIS REMOVAL TO MAKE WAY FOR OTHER ACCUSED PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE TRIED RESCUED HIM FROM THESE CARESSES FOR THE MOMENT
403-128339-0040 FIVE WERE TO BE TRIED TOGETHER NEXT AS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC FORASMUCH AS THEY HAD NOT ASSISTED IT BY WORD OR DEED SO QUICK WAS THE TRIBUNAL TO COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE NATION FOR A CHANCE LOST
403-128339-0041 THAT THESE FIVE CAME DOWN TO HIM BEFORE HE LEFT THE PLACE CONDEMNED TO DIE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE FIRST OF THEM TOLD HIM SO WITH THE CUSTOMARY PRISON SIGN OF DEATH A RAISED FINGER AND THEY ALL ADDED IN WORDS
403-128339-0042 LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THE FIVE HAD HAD IT IS TRUE NO AUDIENCE TO LENGTHEN THEIR PROCEEDINGS FOR WHEN HE AND DOCTOR MANETTE EMERGED FROM THE GATE THERE WAS A GREAT CROWD ABOUT IT
403-128339-0043 IN WHICH THERE SEEMED TO BE EVERY FACE HE HAD SEEN IN COURT EXCEPT TWO FOR WHICH HE LOOKED IN VAIN ON HIS COMING OUT THE CONCOURSE MADE AT HIM ANEW WEEPING EMBRACING AND SHOUTING ALL BY TURNS AND ALL TOGETHER
403-128339-0044 UNTIL THE VERY TIDE OF THE RIVER ON THE BANK OF WHICH THE MAD SCENE WAS ACTED SEEMED TO RUN MAD LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THE SHORE THEY PUT HIM INTO A GREAT CHAIR THEY HAD AMONG THEM
403-128339-0045 IN WINDING AND TRAMPING THROUGH THEM AS THEY HAD REDDENED THEM BELOW THE SNOW WITH A DEEPER DYE THEY CARRIED HIM THUS INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE BUILDING WHERE HE LIVED HER FATHER HAD GONE ON BEFORE TO PREPARE HER
403-128339-0046 AND WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD UPON HIS FEET SHE DROPPED INSENSIBLE IN HIS ARMS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS HEART AND TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD BETWEEN HIS FACE AND THE BRAWLING CROWD
403-128339-0047 SO THAT HIS TEARS AND HER LIPS MIGHT COME TOGETHER UNSEEN A FEW OF THE PEOPLE FELL TO DANCING
403-128339-0048 AFTER GRASPING THE DOCTOR'S HAND AS HE STOOD VICTORIOUS AND PROUD BEFORE HIM AFTER GRASPING THE HAND OF MISTER LORRY
403-128339-0049 AND AFTER EMBRACING THE EVER ZEALOUS AND FAITHFUL PROSS WHO LIFTED HER HE TOOK HIS WIFE IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER UP TO THEIR ROOMS LUCIE MY OWN I AM SAFE O DEAREST CHARLES
403-128339-0050 LET ME THANK GOD FOR THIS ON MY KNEES AS I HAVE PRAYED TO HIM THEY ALL REVERENTLY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND HEARTS WHEN SHE WAS AGAIN IN HIS ARMS HE SAID TO HER
403-128339-0051 NO OTHER MAN IN ALL THIS FRANCE COULD HAVE DONE WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR ME SHE LAID HER HEAD UPON HER FATHER'S BREAST AS SHE HAD LAID HIS POOR HEAD ON HER OWN BREAST LONG LONG AGO HE WAS HAPPY IN THE RETURN HE HAD MADE HER
403-128339-0052 HE WAS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH
403-216-0000 A FEW DAYS PASSED AWAY AND CATHERINE THOUGH NOT ALLOWING HERSELF TO SUSPECT HER FRIEND COULD NOT HELP WATCHING HER CLOSELY THE RESULT OF HER OBSERVATIONS WAS NOT AGREEABLE
403-216-0001 IT MIGHT HAVE PASSED UNNOTICED A SOMETHING OF LANGUID INDIFFERENCE OR OF THAT BOASTED ABSENCE OF MIND WHICH CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE WOULD OCCASIONALLY COME ACROSS HER BUT HAD NOTHING WORSE APPEARED
403-216-0002 THAT MIGHT ONLY HAVE SPREAD A NEW GRACE AND INSPIRED A WARMER INTEREST BUT WHEN CATHERINE SAW HER IN PUBLIC ADMITTING CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ATTENTIONS AS READILY AS THEY WERE OFFERED
403-216-0003 BUT IT WAS A DEGREE OF WILFUL THOUGHTLESSNESS WHICH CATHERINE COULD NOT BUT RESENT JAMES WAS THE SUFFERER SHE SAW HIM GRAVE AND UNEASY AND HOWEVER CARELESS OF HIS PRESENT COMFORT
403-216-0004 AND SHE THOUGHT WITH SINCERE COMPASSION OF HIS APPROACHING DISAPPOINTMENT FOR IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD BELIEVED HERSELF TO OVERHEAR IN THE PUMP ROOM HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS SO INCOMPATIBLE WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF ISABELLA'S ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0005 SHE WISHED BY A GENTLE REMONSTRANCE TO REMIND ISABELLA OF HER SITUATION AND MAKE HER AWARE OF THIS DOUBLE UNKINDNESS BUT FOR REMONSTRANCE EITHER OPPORTUNITY OR COMPREHENSION WAS ALWAYS AGAINST HER
403-216-0006 IF ABLE TO SUGGEST A HINT ISABELLA COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT IN THIS DISTRESS THE INTENDED DEPARTURE OF THE TILNEY FAMILY BECAME HER CHIEF CONSOLATION THEIR JOURNEY INTO GLOUCESTERSHIRE WAS TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN A FEW DAYS
403-216-0007 AND CAPTAIN TILNEY'S REMOVAL WOULD AT LEAST RESTORE PEACE TO EVERY HEART BUT HIS OWN BUT CAPTAIN TILNEY HAD AT PRESENT NO INTENTION OF REMOVING HE WAS NOT TO BE OF THE PARTY TO NORTHANGER HE WAS TO CONTINUE AT BATH
403-216-0008 WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE SHE SPOKE TO HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY FOR MISS THORPE AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0009 MY BROTHER DOES KNOW IT WAS HENRY'S ANSWER DOES HE THEN WHY DOES HE STAY HERE HE MADE NO REPLY AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT SHE EAGERLY CONTINUED
403-216-0010 THE LONGER HE STAYS THE WORSE IT WILL BE FOR HIM AT LAST PRAY ADVISE HIM FOR HIS OWN SAKE AND FOR EVERYBODY'S SAKE TO LEAVE BATH DIRECTLY ABSENCE WILL IN TIME MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE AGAIN BUT HE CAN HAVE NO HOPE HERE
403-216-0011 HENRY SMILED AND SAID I AM SURE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT WISH TO DO THAT THEN YOU WILL PERSUADE HIM TO GO AWAY PERSUASION IS NOT AT COMMAND BUT PARDON ME
403-216-0012 I HAVE MYSELF TOLD HIM THAT MISS THORPE IS ENGAGED HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT AND MUST BE HIS OWN MASTER NO HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT CRIED CATHERINE HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PAIN HE IS GIVING MY BROTHER
403-216-0013 NOT THAT JAMES HAS EVER TOLD ME SO BUT I AM SURE HE IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ARE YOU SURE IT IS MY BROTHER'S DOING YES VERY SURE IS IT MY BROTHER'S ATTENTIONS TO MISS THORPE
403-216-0014 OR MISS THORPE'S ADMISSION OF THEM THAT GIVES THE PAIN
403-216-0015 I THINK MISTER MORLAND WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE A DIFFERENCE NO MAN IS OFFENDED BY ANOTHER MAN'S ADMIRATION OF THE WOMAN HE LOVES IT IS THE WOMAN ONLY WHO CAN MAKE IT A TORMENT CATHERINE BLUSHED FOR HER FRIEND AND SAID
403-216-0016 ISABELLA IS WRONG BUT I AM SURE SHE CANNOT MEAN TO TORMENT FOR SHE IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER SHE HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM EVER SINCE THEY FIRST MET AND WHILE MY FATHER'S CONSENT WAS UNCERTAIN SHE FRETTED HERSELF ALMOST INTO A FEVER
403-216-0017 YOU KNOW SHE MUST BE ATTACHED TO HIM I UNDERSTAND
403-216-0018 AFTER A SHORT PAUSE CATHERINE RESUMED WITH THEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA SO VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER I CAN HAVE NO OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT BUT WHAT CAN YOUR BROTHER MEAN
403-216-0019 IF HE KNOWS HER ENGAGEMENT WHAT CAN HE MEAN BY HIS BEHAVIOUR YOU ARE A VERY CLOSE QUESTIONER AM I I ONLY ASK WHAT I WANT TO BE TOLD
403-216-0020 YES I THINK SO FOR YOU MUST KNOW YOUR BROTHER'S HEART MY BROTHER'S HEART AS YOU TERM IT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I ASSURE YOU I CAN ONLY GUESS AT WELL
403-216-0021 WELL NAY IF IT IS TO BE GUESSWORK LET US ALL GUESS FOR OURSELVES TO BE GUIDED BY SECOND HAND CONJECTURE IS PITIFUL THE PREMISES ARE BEFORE YOU
403-216-0022 AFTER SOME MOMENTS CONSIDERATION YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GUESS AT YOUR BROTHER'S INTENTIONS FROM ALL THIS BUT I AM SURE I CANNOT BUT IS NOT YOUR FATHER UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT
403-216-0023 SURE IF YOUR FATHER WERE TO SPEAK TO HIM HE WOULD GO MY DEAR MISS MORLAND SAID HENRY IN THIS AMIABLE SOLICITUDE FOR YOUR BROTHER'S COMFORT MAY YOU NOT BE A LITTLE MISTAKEN
403-216-0024 ARE YOU NOT CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR WOULD HE THANK YOU EITHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT OR MISS THORPE'S FOR SUPPOSING THAT HER AFFECTION OR AT LEAST HER GOOD BEHAVIOUR IS ONLY TO BE SECURED BY HER SEEING NOTHING OF CAPTAIN TILNEY
403-216-0025 IS HE SAFE ONLY IN SOLITUDE OR IS HER HEART CONSTANT TO HIM ONLY WHEN UNSOLICITED BY ANYONE ELSE HE CANNOT THINK THIS AND YOU MAY BE SURE
403-216-0026 PERCEIVING HER STILL TO LOOK DOUBTFUL AND GRAVE HE ADDED THOUGH FREDERICK DOES NOT LEAVE BATH WITH US HE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN BUT A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS ONLY A FEW DAYS BEHIND US
403-216-0027 HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE WILL SOON EXPIRE AND HE MUST RETURN TO HIS REGIMENT AND WHAT WILL THEN BE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
403-216-0028 THE MESS ROOM WILL DRINK ISABELLA THORPE FOR A FORTNIGHT AND SHE WILL LAUGH WITH YOUR BROTHER OVER POOR TILNEY'S PASSION FOR A MONTH CATHERINE WOULD CONTEND NO LONGER AGAINST COMFORT
4051-10927-0000 IT'S LATE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHE SAID WHEN SHE HAD GONE THROUGH THE DOORWAY ANNA IT'S NECESSARY FOR ME TO HAVE A TALK WITH YOU WITH ME SHE SAID WONDERINGLY SHE CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE DOOR OF THE DRESSING ROOM AND LOOKED AT HIM
4051-10927-0001 WHY WHAT IS IT WHAT ABOUT SHE ASKED SITTING DOWN WELL LET'S TALK IF IT'S SO NECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET TO SLEEP ANNA SAID WHAT CAME TO HER LIPS AND MARVELED HEARING HERSELF AT HER OWN CAPACITY FOR LYING
4051-10927-0002 HOW SIMPLE AND NATURAL WERE HER WORDS AND HOW LIKELY THAT SHE WAS SIMPLY SLEEPY
4051-10927-0003 THAT ANYONE WHO DID NOT KNOW HER AS HER HUSBAND KNEW HER COULD NOT HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING UNNATURAL EITHER IN THE SOUND OR THE SENSE OF HER WORDS BUT TO HIM KNOWING HER KNOWING THAT WHENEVER HE WENT TO BED FIVE MINUTES LATER THAN USUAL
4051-10927-0004 SHE NOTICED IT AND ASKED HIM THE REASON TO HIM KNOWING THAT EVERY JOY EVERY PLEASURE AND PAIN THAT SHE FELT SHE COMMUNICATED TO HIM AT ONCE TO HIM NOW TO SEE THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO NOTICE HIS STATE OF MIND
4051-10927-0005 THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO SAY A WORD ABOUT HERSELF MEANT A GREAT DEAL HE SAW THAT THE INMOST RECESSES OF HER SOUL THAT HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO LAIN OPEN BEFORE HIM WERE CLOSED AGAINST HIM MORE THAN THAT HE SAW FROM HER TONE
4051-10927-0006 THAT SHE WAS NOT EVEN PERTURBED AT THAT BUT AS IT WERE SAID STRAIGHT OUT TO HIM YES IT'S SHUT UP AND SO IT MUST BE AND WILL BE IN FUTURE NOW HE EXPERIENCED A FEELING SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT HAVE RETURNING HOME AND FINDING HIS OWN HOUSE LOCKED UP
4051-10927-0007 BUT PERHAPS THE KEY MAY YET BE FOUND THOUGHT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH I WANT TO WARN YOU HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE THAT THROUGH THOUGHTLESSNESS AND LACK OF CAUTION
4051-10927-0008 YOUR TOO ANIMATED CONVERSATION THIS EVENING WITH COUNT VRONSKY HE ENUNCIATED THE NAME FIRMLY AND WITH DELIBERATE EMPHASIS ATTRACTED ATTENTION HE TALKED AND LOOKED AT HER LAUGHING EYES WHICH FRIGHTENED HIM NOW WITH THEIR IMPENETRABLE LOOK
4051-10927-0009 I WASN'T DULL DOES THAT OFFEND YOU ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHIVERED AND BENT HIS HANDS TO MAKE THE JOINTS CRACK
4051-10927-0010 ANNA IS THIS YOU SAID ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH QUIETLY MAKING AN EFFORT OVER HIMSELF AND RESTRAINING THE MOTION OF HIS FINGERS
4051-10927-0011 WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH PAUSED AND RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD AND HIS EYES HE SAW THAT INSTEAD OF DOING AS HE HAD INTENDED THAT IS TO SAY WARNING HIS WIFE AGAINST A MISTAKE IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD
4051-10927-0012 HE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY BECOME AGITATED OVER WHAT WAS THE AFFAIR OF HER CONSCIENCE AND WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE BARRIER HE FANCIED BETWEEN THEM
4051-10927-0013 AND I BEG YOU TO LISTEN TO IT I CONSIDER JEALOUSY AS YOU KNOW A HUMILIATING AND DEGRADING FEELING AND I SHALL NEVER ALLOW MYSELF TO BE INFLUENCED BY IT BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES OF DECORUM WHICH CANNOT BE DISREGARDED WITH IMPUNITY THIS EVENING IT WAS NOT I OBSERVED IT
4051-10927-0014 BUT JUDGING BY THE IMPRESSION MADE ON THE COMPANY EVERYONE OBSERVED THAT YOUR CONDUCT AND DEPORTMENT WERE NOT ALTOGETHER WHAT COULD BE DESIRED I POSITIVELY DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID ANNA SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS HE DOESN'T CARE SHE THOUGHT
4051-10927-0015 BUT OTHER PEOPLE NOTICED IT AND THAT'S WHAT UPSETS HIM YOU'RE NOT WELL ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHE ADDED AND SHE GOT UP AND WOULD HAVE GONE TOWARDS THE DOOR BUT HE MOVED FORWARD AS THOUGH HE WOULD STOP HER HIS FACE WAS UGLY AND FORBIDDING
4051-10927-0016 AS ANNA HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SHE STOPPED AND BENDING HER HEAD BACK AND ON ONE SIDE BEGAN WITH HER RAPID HAND TAKING OUT HER HAIRPINS WELL I'M LISTENING TO WHAT'S TO COME SHE SAID CALMLY AND IRONICALLY AND INDEED I LISTEN WITH INTEREST
4051-10927-0017 BEGAN ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH FERRETING IN ONE'S SOUL ONE OFTEN FERRETS OUT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE LAIN THERE UNNOTICED YOUR FEELINGS ARE AN AFFAIR OF YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE
4051-10927-0018 TO MYSELF AND TO GOD TO POINT OUT TO YOU YOUR DUTIES OUR LIFE HAS BEEN JOINED NOT BY MAN BUT BY GOD THAT UNION CAN ONLY BE SEVERED BY A CRIME AND A CRIME OF THAT NATURE BRINGS ITS OWN CHASTISEMENT
4051-10927-0019 I DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD AND OH DEAR HOW SLEEPY I AM UNLUCKILY SHE SAID RAPIDLY PASSING HER HAND THROUGH HER HAIR FEELING FOR THE REMAINING HAIRPINS ANNA FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T SPEAK LIKE THAT HE SAID GENTLY PERHAPS I AM MISTAKEN
4051-10927-0020 BUT BELIEVE ME WHAT I SAY I SAY AS MUCH FOR MYSELF AS FOR YOU I AM YOUR HUSBAND AND I LOVE YOU FOR AN INSTANT HER FACE FELL AND THE MOCKING GLEAM IN HER EYES DIED AWAY BUT THE WORD LOVE THREW HER INTO REVOLT AGAIN SHE THOUGHT
4051-10927-0021 LOVE CAN HE LOVE IF HE HADN'T HEARD THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS LOVE HE WOULD NEVER HAVE USED THE WORD HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LOVE IS ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH REALLY I DON'T UNDERSTAND SHE SAID DEFINE WHAT IT IS YOU FIND
4051-10927-0022 THAT MY WORDS SEEM TO YOU UTTERLY UNNECESSARY AND OUT OF PLACE
4051-10927-0023 IN THAT CASE I BEG YOU TO FORGIVE ME BUT IF YOU ARE CONSCIOUS YOURSELF OF EVEN THE SMALLEST FOUNDATION FOR THEM
4051-10927-0024 WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE BEDROOM HE WAS ALREADY IN BED HIS LIPS WERE STERNLY COMPRESSED AND HIS EYES LOOKED AWAY FROM HER ANNA GOT INTO HER BED AND LAY EXPECTING EVERY MINUTE THAT HE WOULD BEGIN TO SPEAK TO HER AGAIN SHE BOTH FEARED HIS SPEAKING AND WISHED FOR IT
4051-10927-0025 BUT HE WAS SILENT SHE WAITED FOR A LONG WHILE WITHOUT MOVING AND HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM SHE THOUGHT OF THAT OTHER SHE PICTURED HIM AND FELT HOW HER HEART WAS FLOODED WITH EMOTION AND GUILTY DELIGHT AT THE THOUGHT OF HIM SUDDENLY
4051-10927-0026 SHE HEARD AN EVEN TRANQUIL SNORE FOR THE FIRST INSTANT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SEEMED AS IT WERE APPALLED AT HIS OWN SNORING AND CEASED BUT AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO BREATHINGS THE SNORE SOUNDED AGAIN
4051-10927-0027 WITH A NEW TRANQUIL RHYTHM IT'S LATE IT'S LATE SHE WHISPERED WITH A SMILE
4051-11217-0000 WHY IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME THEY WERE THE SONS OF THAT VERY PHRIXUS WHO IN HIS CHILDHOOD HAD BEEN CARRIED TO COLCHIS ON THE BACK OF THE GOLDEN FLEECED RAM SINCE THAT TIME PHRIXUS HAD MARRIED THE KING'S DAUGHTER
4051-11217-0001 AND HAD SPENT THEIR PLAY DAYS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE GROVE IN THE CENTER OF WHICH THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS HANGING UPON A TREE THEY WERE NOW ON THEIR WAY TO GREECE IN HOPES OF GETTING BACK A KINGDOM THAT HAD BEEN WRONGFULLY TAKEN FROM THEIR FATHER
4051-11217-0002 WHEN THE PRINCES UNDERSTOOD WHITHER THE ARGONAUTS WERE GOING THEY OFFERED TO TURN BACK AND GUIDE THEM TO COLCHIS
4051-11217-0003 EVERY PERSON WHO MIGHT VENTURE WITHIN HIS REACH THERE ARE OTHER DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG PRINCES
4051-11217-0004 I DO NOT WONDER THAT YOU THINK THE DRAGON VERY TERRIBLE YOU HAVE GROWN UP FROM INFANCY IN THE FEAR OF THIS MONSTER
4051-11217-0005 AT ALL EVENTS TURN BACK WHO MAY I WILL NEVER SEE GREECE AGAIN UNLESS I CARRY WITH ME THE GOLDEN FLEECE WE WILL NONE OF US TURN BACK CRIED HIS NINE AND FORTY BRAVE COMRADES
4051-11217-0006 MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO HIM AND ORPHEUS WHOSE CUSTOM IT WAS TO SET EVERYTHING TO MUSIC BEGAN TO HARP AND SING MOST GLORIOUSLY
4051-11217-0007 AND NOTHING SO TRULY HONORABLE AS TO BE EATEN UP AT ONE MOUTHFUL IN CASE OF THE WORST AFTER THIS BEING NOW UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE TWO PRINCES WHO WERE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE WAY
4051-11217-0008 HEARD OF THEIR ARRIVAL HE INSTANTLY SUMMONED JASON TO COURT
4051-11217-0009 WHO DETHRONED HIS FATHER YOU ARE WELCOME BRAVE JASON
4051-11217-0010 PRAY ARE YOU ON A PLEASURE VOYAGE
4051-11217-0011 OR WHAT OTHER CAUSE HAS PROCURED ME THE HAPPINESS OF SEEING YOU AT MY COURT GREAT SIR REPLIED JASON
4051-11217-0012 FOR CHIRON HAD TAUGHT HIM HOW TO BEHAVE WITH PROPRIETY WHETHER TO KINGS OR BEGGARS
4051-11217-0013 PROVIDED I BRING HIM THE GOLDEN FLEECE THIS AS YOUR MAJESTY IS AWARE IS NOW HANGING ON A TREE HERE AT COLCHIS AND I HUMBLY SOLICIT YOUR GRACIOUS LEAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY IN SPITE OF HIMSELF THE KING'S FACE TWISTED ITSELF INTO AN ANGRY FROWN
4051-11217-0014 FOR ABOVE ALL THINGS ELSE IN THE WORLD HE PRIZED THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND WAS EVEN SUSPECTED OF HAVING DONE A VERY WICKED ACT IN ORDER TO GET IT INTO HIS OWN POSSESSION
4051-11217-0015 HAD COME TO COLCHIS WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF TAKING AWAY HIS CHIEF TREASURE
4051-11217-0016 WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS WHICH YOU MUST FULFILL BEFORE GETTING POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE I HAVE HEARD REJOINED THE YOUTH THAT A DRAGON LIES BENEATH THE TREE ON WHICH THE PRIZE HANGS AND THAT WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM RUNS THE RISK OF BEING DEVOURED AT A MOUTHFUL
4051-11217-0017 TRUE SAID THE KING WITH A SMILE THAT DID NOT LOOK PARTICULARLY GOOD NATURED VERY TRUE YOUNG MAN BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AS HARD OR PERHAPS A LITTLE HARDER TO BE DONE BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING DEVOURED BY THE DRAGON FOR EXAMPLE
4051-11217-0018 WHICH VULCAN THE WONDERFUL BLACKSMITH MADE FOR ME THERE IS A FURNACE IN EACH OF THEIR STOMACHS AND THEY BREATHE SUCH HOT FIRE OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS AND NOSTRILS THAT NOBODY HAS HITHERTO GONE NIGH THEM WITHOUT BEING INSTANTLY BURNED TO A SMALL BLACK CINDER
4051-11217-0019 I MUST ENCOUNTER THE PERIL ANSWERED JASON COMPOSEDLY SINCE IT STANDS IN THE WAY OF MY PURPOSE
4051-11217-0020 FROM WHICH CADMUS RAISED A CROP OF ARMED MEN THEY ARE AN UNRULY SET OF REPROBATES THOSE SONS OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH AND UNLESS YOU TREAT THEM SUITABLY THEY WILL FALL UPON YOU SWORD IN HAND
4051-11217-0021 AND THE FOUR FOOTED PEDANT HIS SCHOOLMASTER INTO THE BARGAIN WHY WHAT A FOOLHARDY SELF CONCEITED COXCOMB HE IS WE'LL SEE WHAT MY FIRE BREATHING BULLS WILL DO FOR HIM WELL PRINCE JASON HE CONTINUED ALOUD AND AS COMPLAISANTLY AS HE COULD

4051-11217-0023 THIS YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM I AM THE KING'S DAUGHTER SHE SAID TO HIM AND MY NAME IS MEDEA I KNOW A GREAT DEAL OF WHICH OTHER YOUNG PRINCESSES ARE IGNORANT AND CAN DO MANY THINGS WHICH THEY WOULD BE AFRAID SO MUCH AS TO DREAM OF IF YOU WILL TRUST TO ME
4051-11217-0024 I CAN INSTRUCT YOU HOW TO TAME THE FIERY BULLS AND SOW THE DRAGON'S TEETH AND GET THE GOLDEN FLEECE INDEED BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS ANSWERED JASON IF YOU WILL DO ME THIS SERVICE I PROMISE TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU MY WHOLE LIFE LONG GAZING AT MEDEA
4051-11217-0025 HE BEHELD A WONDERFUL INTELLIGENCE IN HER FACE SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHOSE EYES ARE FULL OF MYSTERY SO THAT WHILE LOOKING INTO THEM
4051-11217-0026 YET CAN NEVER BE CERTAIN WHETHER YOU SEE INTO THE FARTHEST DEPTHS OR WHETHER THERE BE NOT SOMETHING ELSE HIDDEN AT THE BOTTOM IF JASON HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF FEARING ANYTHING
4051-11217-0027 FOR BEAUTIFUL AS SHE NOW LOOKED
4051-11217-0028 PRINCESS HE EXCLAIMED YOU SEEM INDEED VERY WISE AND VERY POWERFUL BUT HOW CAN YOU HELP ME TO DO THE THINGS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK ARE YOU AN ENCHANTRESS YES PRINCE JASON ANSWERED MEDEA WITH A SMILE
4051-11217-0029 IT IS WELL FOR YOU THAT I AM FAVORABLY INCLINED FOR OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HARDLY ESCAPE BEING SNAPPED UP BY THE DRAGON I SHOULD NOT SO MUCH CARE FOR THE DRAGON REPLIED JASON IF I ONLY KNEW HOW TO MANAGE THE BRAZEN FOOTED AND FIERY LUNGED BULLS
4051-11217-0030 WHICH WILL PREVENT YOU FROM BEING BURNED UP AND CURE YOU IF YOU CHANCE TO BE A LITTLE SCORCHED
4051-11217-0031 WHICH IT CONTAINED AND WHERE TO MEET HER AT MIDNIGHT ONLY BE BRAVE ADDED SHE AND BEFORE DAYBREAK THE BRAZEN BULLS SHALL BE TAMED THE YOUNG MAN ASSURED HER THAT HIS HEART WOULD NOT FAIL HIM HE THEN REJOINED HIS COMRADES AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THE PRINCESS AND HIMSELF
4051-11217-0032 AND WARNED THEM TO BE IN READINESS IN CASE THERE MIGHT BE NEED OF THEIR HELP AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE MET THE BEAUTIFUL MEDEA ON THE MARBLE STEPS OF THE KING'S PALACE
4051-11217-0033 JUST AS THEY HAD BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE MONSTER'S JAWS BY CADMUS LONG AGO MEDEA THEN LED JASON DOWN THE PALACE STEPS AND THROUGH THE SILENT STREETS OF THE CITY AND INTO THE ROYAL PASTURE GROUND WHERE THE TWO BRAZEN FOOTED BULLS WERE KEPT IT WAS A STARRY NIGHT
4051-11217-0034 WITH A BRIGHT GLEAM ALONG THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE SKY
4051-11217-0035 IN THAT FARTHEST CORNER OF THE FIELD IT WILL BE EXCELLENT SPORT I ASSURE YOU WHEN THEY CATCH A GLIMPSE OF YOUR FIGURE MY FATHER AND ALL HIS COURT DELIGHT IN NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE A STRANGER TRYING TO YOKE THEM IN ORDER TO COME AT THE GOLDEN FLEECE
4051-11217-0036 IT MAKES A HOLIDAY IN COLCHIS WHENEVER SUCH A THING HAPPENS FOR MY PART I ENJOY IT IMMENSELY YOU CANNOT IMAGINE IN WHAT A MERE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THEIR HOT BREATH SHRIVELS A YOUNG MAN INTO A BLACK CINDER ARE YOU SURE BEAUTIFUL MEDEA ASKED JASON
4051-11217-0037 THE INSTANT HE MADE A STEP FARTHER
4051-11217-0038 THESE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WERE CAUSED BY THE BREATH OF THE BRAZEN BULLS WHICH WAS QUIETLY STEALING OUT OF THEIR FOUR NOSTRILS AS THEY LAY CHEWING THEIR CUDS AT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE STEPS WHICH JASON MADE
4051-11217-0039 THE FOUR FIERY STREAMS APPEARED TO GUSH OUT SOMEWHAT MORE PLENTIFULLY FOR THE TWO BRAZEN BULLS HAD HEARD HIS FOOT TRAMP AND WERE LIFTING UP THEIR HOT NOSES TO SNUFF THE AIR HE WENT A LITTLE FARTHER
4051-11217-0040 ONE OTHER STRIDE DID BOLD JASON MAKE AND SUDDENLY AS A STREAK OF LIGHTNING ON CAME THESE FIERY ANIMALS
4051-11217-0041 AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FASHION WITH ANGRY BULLS THEIR BREATH SCORCHED THE HERBAGE BEFORE THEM SO INTENSELY HOT IT WAS INDEED THAT IT CAUGHT A DRY TREE UNDER WHICH JASON WAS NOW STANDING AND SET IT ALL IN A LIGHT BLAZE BUT AS FOR JASON HIMSELF
4051-11218-0000 GREATLY ENCOURAGED AT FINDING HIMSELF NOT YET TURNED INTO A CINDER
4051-11218-0001 JUST AS THE BRAZEN BRUTES FANCIED THEMSELVES SURE OF TOSSING HIM INTO THE AIR HE CAUGHT ONE OF THEM BY THE HORN AND THE OTHER BY HIS SCREWED UP TAIL AND HELD THEM IN A GRIPE LIKE THAT OF AN IRON VICE ONE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE OTHER WITH HIS LEFT
4051-11218-0002 TO BE SURE BUT THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THE BRAZEN BULLS WERE ENCHANTED CREATURES AND THAT JASON HAD BROKEN THE SPELL OF THEIR FIERY FIERCENESS BY HIS BOLD WAY OF HANDLING THEM AND EVER SINCE THAT TIME
4051-11218-0003 WHEN DANGER ASSAILS THEM TO DO WHAT THEY CALL TAKING THE BULL BY THE HORNS AND TO GRIPE HIM BY THE TAIL IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING THAT IS TO THROW ASIDE FEAR AND OVERCOME THE PERIL BY DESPISING IT
4051-11218-0004 IT WAS NOW EASY TO YOKE THE BULLS AND TO HARNESS THEM TO THE PLOW
4051-11218-0005 WHO PERHAPS USED TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE HARNESSED TO THE PLOW AT ANY RATE OUR HERO SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY WELL IN BREAKING UP THE GREENSWARD AND BY THE TIME THAT THE MOON WAS A QUARTER OF HER JOURNEY UP THE SKY THE PLOWED FIELD LAY BEFORE HIM
4051-11218-0006 A LARGE TRACT OF BLACK EARTH READY TO BE SOWN WITH THE DRAGON'S TEETH SO JASON SCATTERED THEM BROADCAST AND HARROWED THEM INTO THE SOIL WITH A BRUSH HARROW AND TOOK HIS STAND ON THE EDGE OF THE FIELD ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT
4051-11218-0007 MUST WE WAIT LONG FOR HARVEST TIME HE INQUIRED OF MEDEA WHO WAS NOW STANDING BY HIS SIDE WHETHER SOONER OR LATER IT WILL BE SURE TO COME ANSWERED THE PRINCESS A CROP OF ARMED MEN NEVER FAILS TO SPRING UP WHEN THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN
4051-11218-0008 AND WHOLE MONTHS BEFORE THE YELLOW GRAIN WOULD BE RIPENED FOR THE SICKLE BUT BY AND BY ALL OVER THE FIELD
4051-11218-0009 LIKE SPARKLING DROPS OF DEW THESE BRIGHT OBJECTS SPROUTED HIGHER AND PROVED TO BE THE STEEL HEADS OF SPEARS THEN THERE WAS A DAZZLING GLEAM FROM A VAST NUMBER OF POLISHED BRASS HELMETS BENEATH WHICH AS THEY GREW FARTHER OUT OF THE SOIL
4051-11218-0010 TORE THEMSELVES UP BY THE ROOTS WHEREVER A DRAGON'S TOOTH HAD FALLEN THERE STOOD A MAN ARMED FOR BATTLE THEY MADE A CLANGOR WITH THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND EYED ONE ANOTHER FIERCELY
4051-11218-0011 FULL OF RAGE AND STORMY PASSIONS AND READY TO TAKE THE LIFE OF EVERY HUMAN BROTHER IN RECOMPENSE OF THE BOON OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE
4051-11218-0012 AND HOW IT WOULD HAVE REJOICED ANY GREAT CAPTAIN WHO WAS BENT ON CONQUERING THE WORLD LIKE ALEXANDER OR NAPOLEON TO RAISE A CROP OF ARMED SOLDIERS AS EASILY AS JASON DID
4051-11218-0013 CLASHING THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND BOILING OVER WITH THE RED HOT THIRST FOR BATTLE THEN THEY BEGAN TO SHOUT SHOW US THE ENEMY LEAD US TO THE CHARGE DEATH OR VICTORY COME ON BRAVE COMRADES CONQUER OR DIE
4051-11218-0014 AND A HUNDRED OTHER OUTCRIES SUCH AS MEN ALWAYS BELLOW FORTH ON A BATTLE FIELD AND WHICH THESE DRAGON PEOPLE SEEMED TO HAVE AT THEIR TONGUES ENDS AT LAST THE FRONT RANK CAUGHT SIGHT OF JASON WHO BEHOLDING THE FLASH OF SO MANY WEAPONS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4051-11218-0015 HAD THOUGHT IT BEST TO DRAW HIS SWORD IN A MOMENT ALL THE SONS OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH APPEARED TO TAKE JASON FOR AN ENEMY AND CRYING WITH ONE VOICE GUARD THE GOLDEN FLEECE THEY RAN AT HIM WITH UPLIFTED SWORDS AND PROTRUDED SPEARS
4051-11218-0016 THE ARMED MEN WERE NOW SO NIGH THAT JASON COULD DISCERN THE FIRE FLASHING OUT OF THEIR ENRAGED EYES WHEN HE LET FLY THE STONE AND SAW IT STRIKE THE HELMET OF A TALL WARRIOR WHO WAS RUSHING UPON HIM WITH HIS BLADE ALOFT
4051-11218-0017 AND INSTEAD OF RUNNING ANY FARTHER TOWARDS JASON THEY BEGAN TO FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES THE CONFUSION SPREAD THROUGH THE HOST
4051-11218-0018 HEWING AND STABBING AT ONE ANOTHER LOPPING OFF ARMS HEADS AND LEGS AND DOING SUCH MEMORABLE DEEDS THAT JASON WAS FILLED WITH IMMENSE ADMIRATION ALTHOUGH AT THE SAME TIME HE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING TO BEHOLD THESE MIGHTY MEN PUNISHING EACH OTHER
4051-11218-0019 FOR AN OFFENSE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD COMMITTED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALMOST AS SHORT INDEED AS IT HAD TAKEN THEM TO GROW UP ALL BUT ONE OF THE HEROES OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH WERE STRETCHED LIFELESS ON THE FIELD
4051-11218-0020 THE LAST SURVIVOR THE BRAVEST AND STRONGEST OF THE WHOLE HAD JUST FORCE ENOUGH TO WAVE HIS CRIMSON SWORD OVER HIS HEAD AND GIVE A SHOUT OF EXULTATION CRYING VICTORY VICTORY IMMORTAL FAME
4051-11218-0021 WHEN HE HIMSELF FELL DOWN AND LAY QUIETLY AMONG HIS SLAIN BRETHREN AND THERE WAS THE END OF THE ARMY THAT HAD SPROUTED FROM THE DRAGON'S TEETH THAT FIERCE AND FEVERISH FIGHT WAS THE ONLY ENJOYMENT WHICH THEY HAD TASTED ON THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH
4051-11218-0022 LET THEM SLEEP IN THE BED OF HONOR SAID THE PRINCESS MEDEA WITH A SLY SMILE AT JASON THE WORLD WILL ALWAYS HAVE SIMPLETONS ENOUGH JUST LIKE THEM FIGHTING AND DYING FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT AND FANCYING THAT POSTERITY
4051-11218-0023 WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PUT LAUREL WREATHS ON THEIR RUSTY AND BATTERED HELMETS COULD YOU HELP SMILING PRINCE JASON TO SEE THE SELF CONCEIT OF THAT LAST FELLOW
4051-11218-0024 YOU WILL THINK DIFFERENTLY IN THE MORNING SAID MEDEA TRUE THE GOLDEN FLEECE MAY NOT BE SO VALUABLE AS YOU HAVE THOUGHT IT BUT THEN THERE IS NOTHING BETTER IN THE WORLD AND ONE MUST NEEDS HAVE AN OBJECT YOU KNOW COME YOUR NIGHT'S WORK HAS BEEN WELL PERFORMED
4051-11218-0025 THAT THE FIRST PART OF YOUR ALLOTTED TASK IS FULFILLED
4051-11218-0026 ENTERING THE PRESENCE CHAMBER HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE AND MADE A LOW OBEISANCE YOUR EYES LOOK HEAVY PRINCE JASON OBSERVED THE KING YOU APPEAR TO HAVE SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
4051-11218-0027 AND HAVE CONCLUDED NOT TO GET YOURSELF SCORCHED TO A CINDER IN ATTEMPTING TO TAME MY BRAZEN LUNGED BULLS
4051-11218-0028 THE FIELD HAS BEEN PLOWED THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN BROADCAST AND HARROWED INTO THE SOIL
4051-11218-0029 AND DEPART WITH MY NINE AND FORTY COMRADES
4051-11218-0030 AND LOOKED VERY ANGRY AND EXCESSIVELY DISTURBED FOR HE KNEW THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS KINGLY PROMISE HE OUGHT NOW TO PERMIT JASON TO WIN THE FLEECE IF HIS COURAGE AND SKILL SHOULD ENABLE HIM TO DO SO BUT SINCE THE YOUNG MAN HAD MET WITH SUCH GOOD LUCK IN THE MATTER OF THE BRAZEN BULLS
4051-11218-0031 AND THE DRAGON'S TEETH THE KING FEARED THAT HE WOULD BE EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN SLAYING THE DRAGON AND THEREFORE THOUGH HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE SEEN JASON SNAPPED UP AT A MOUTHFUL HE WAS RESOLVED AND IT WAS A VERY WRONG THING OF THIS WICKED POTENTATE
4051-11218-0032 NOT TO RUN ANY FURTHER RISK OF LOSING HIS BELOVED FLEECE YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS BUSINESS YOUNG MAN SAID HE IF MY UNDUTIFUL DAUGHTER MEDEA HAD NOT HELPED YOU WITH HER ENCHANTMENTS HAD YOU ACTED FAIRLY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THIS INSTANT
4051-11218-0033 TO SPEAK MY MIND PLAINLY YOU SHALL NEVER SET EYES ON SO MUCH AS ONE OF ITS GLISTENING LOCKS JASON LEFT THE KING'S PRESENCE IN GREAT SORROW AND ANGER HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BETTER
4051-11218-0034 MARCH AT ONCE TO THE GROVE OF MARS SLAY THE DRAGON TAKE POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE GET ON BOARD THE ARGO AND SPREAD ALL SAIL FOR IOLCHOS THE SUCCESS OF THIS SCHEME DEPENDED IT IS TRUE ON THE DOUBTFUL POINT
4051-11218-0035 AT SO MANY MOUTHFULS BY THE DRAGON BUT AS JASON WAS HASTENING DOWN THE PALACE STEPS
4051-11218-0036 AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD DONE HIM SO MUCH SERVICE ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE HE WAS BY NO MEANS VERY CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULD NOT DO HIM AN EQUALLY GREAT MISCHIEF BEFORE SUNSET THESE ENCHANTRESSES YOU MUST KNOW ARE NEVER TO BE DEPENDED UPON
4051-11218-0037 WILL HE GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER RISK OR TROUBLE ON THE CONTRARY ANSWERED JASON HE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME FOR TAMING THE BRAZEN BULLS AND SOWING THE DRAGON'S TEETH
4051-11218-0038 AND HE FORBIDS ME TO MAKE ANY MORE ATTEMPTS AND POSITIVELY REFUSES TO GIVE UP THE GOLDEN FLEECE WHETHER I SLAY THE DRAGON OR NO YES JASON SAID THE PRINCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU MORE UNLESS YOU SET SAIL FROM COLCHIS
4051-11218-0039 STEALING THROUGH THE STREETS OF COLCHIS ON THEIR WAY TO THE SACRED GROVE
4051-11218-0040 LOWING NODDING THEIR HEADS AND THRUSTING FORTH THEIR SNOUTS WHICH AS OTHER CATTLE DO
4051-11218-0041 THEIR FIERCE NATURE WAS THOROUGHLY TAMED AND WITH THEIR FIERCENESS THE TWO FURNACES IN THEIR STOMACHS HAD LIKEWISE BEEN EXTINGUISHED
4051-11218-0042 THAN EVER BEFORE INDEED IT HAD HERETOFORE BEEN A GREAT INCONVENIENCE TO THESE POOR ANIMALS THAT WHENEVER THEY WISHED TO EAT A MOUTHFUL OF GRASS THE FIRE OUT OF THEIR NOSTRILS HAD SHRIVELED IT UP BEFORE THEY COULD MANAGE TO CROP IT
4051-11218-0043 HOW THEY CONTRIVED TO KEEP THEMSELVES ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE BUT NOW INSTEAD OF EMITTING JETS OF FLAME AND STREAMS OF SULPHUROUS VAPOR THEY BREATHED THE VERY SWEETEST OF COW BREATH AFTER KINDLY PATTING THE BULLS
4051-11218-0044 JASON FOLLOWED MEDEA'S GUIDANCE INTO THE GROVE OF MARS WHERE THE GREAT OAK TREES THAT HAD BEEN GROWING FOR CENTURIES THREW SO THICK A SHADE THAT THE MOONBEAMS STRUGGLED VAINLY TO FIND THEIR WAY THROUGH IT
4051-11218-0045 MEDEA SQUEEZED JASON'S HAND LOOK YONDER SHE WHISPERED DO YOU SEE IT GLEAMING AMONG THE VENERABLE OAKS THERE WAS A RADIANCE NOT LIKE THE MOONBEAMS BUT RATHER RESEMBLING THE GOLDEN GLORY OF THE SETTING SUN
4051-11218-0046 WHAT IS IT ASKED JASON HAVE YOU COME SO FAR TO SEEK IT
4051-11218-0047 WHEN IT GLITTERS BEFORE YOUR EYES IT IS THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON WENT ONWARD A FEW STEPS FARTHER AND THEN STOPPED TO GAZE O HOW BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKED SHINING WITH A MARVELOUS LIGHT OF ITS OWN THAT
4051-11218-0048 PRIZE WHICH SO MANY HEROES HAD LONGED TO BEHOLD BUT HAD PERISHED IN THE QUEST OF IT EITHER BY THE PERILS OF THEIR VOYAGE OR BY THE FIERY BREATH OF THE BRAZEN LUNGED BULLS HOW GLORIOUSLY IT SHINES CRIED JASON IN A RAPTURE IT
4051-11218-0049 THE TERRIBLE DRAGON HAD QUITE SLIPPED OUT OF JASON'S MEMORY SOON HOWEVER SOMETHING CAME TO PASS THAT REMINDED HIM WHAT PERILS WERE STILL TO BE ENCOUNTERED AN ANTELOPE THAT PROBABLY MISTOOK THE YELLOW RADIANCE FOR SUNRISE CAME
4051-11218-0050 FOR HE WAS TWISTED ROUND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE ON WHICH THE FLEECE HUNG AND SEIZING THE POOR ANTELOPE SWALLOWED HIM WITH ONE SNAP OF HIS JAWS AFTER THIS FEAT THE DRAGON SEEMED SENSIBLE THAT SOME OTHER LIVING CREATURE WAS WITHIN REACH
4051-11218-0051 ON WHICH HE FELT INCLINED TO FINISH HIS MEAL IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS HE KEPT POKING HIS UGLY SNOUT AMONG THE TREES STRETCHING OUT HIS NECK A TERRIBLE LONG WAY NOW HERE
4051-11218-0052 UPON MY WORD AS THE HEAD CAME WAVING AND UNDULATING THROUGH THE AIR AND REACHING ALMOST WITHIN ARM'S LENGTH OF PRINCE JASON IT WAS A VERY HIDEOUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE SIGHT
4051-11218-0053 THE GAPE OF HIS ENORMOUS JAWS WAS NEARLY AS WIDE AS THE GATEWAY OF THE KING'S PALACE WELL JASON WHISPERED MEDEA FOR SHE WAS ILL NATURED AS ALL ENCHANTRESSES ARE AND WANTED TO MAKE THE BOLD YOUTH TREMBLE
4051-11218-0054 WHAT DO YOU THINK NOW OF YOUR PROSPECT OF WINNING THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON ANSWERED ONLY BY DRAWING HIS SWORD AND MAKING A STEP FORWARD STAY FOOLISH YOUTH SAID MEDEA GRASPING HIS ARM
4051-11218-0055 FAR MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN YOUR SWORD THE DRAGON HAD PROBABLY HEARD THE VOICES FOR SWIFT AS LIGHTNING HIS BLACK HEAD AND FORKED TONGUE CAME HISSING AMONG THE TREES AGAIN DARTING FULL FORTY FEET AT A STRETCH AS IT APPROACHED
4051-11218-0056 MEDEA TOSSED THE CONTENTS OF THE GOLD BOX RIGHT DOWN THE MONSTER'S WIDE OPEN THROAT IMMEDIATELY WITH AN OUTRAGEOUS HISS AND A TREMENDOUS WRIGGLE FLINGING HIS TAIL UP TO THE TIP TOP OF THE TALLEST TREE
4051-11218-0057 AND SHATTERING ALL ITS BRANCHES AS IT CRASHED HEAVILY DOWN AGAIN THE DRAGON FELL AT FULL LENGTH UPON THE GROUND AND LAY QUITE MOTIONLESS IT IS ONLY A SLEEPING POTION SAID THE ENCHANTRESS TO PRINCE JASON
4051-11218-0058 SO I DID NOT WISH TO KILL HIM OUTRIGHT QUICK SNATCH THE PRIZE AND LET US BEGONE YOU HAVE WON THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON CAUGHT THE FLEECE FROM THE TREE
4051-11218-0059 WITH HER PEACOCK BESIDE HER SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS FOR JOY AND BECKONING HIM TO MAKE HASTE DISAPPEARED AMONG THE DUSKINESS OF THE TREES
4051-11218-0060 WHO WERE DISPORTING THEMSELVES IN THE MOONLIGHT A FEW HUNDRED FEET ALOFT JASON BADE THEM TELL THE REST OF THE ARGONAUTS TO EMBARK AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE BUT LYNCEUS WITH HIS SHARP EYES HAD ALREADY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIM BRINGING THE GOLDEN FLEECE
4051-11218-0061 ALTHOUGH SEVERAL STONE WALLS A HILL AND THE BLACK SHADOWS OF THE GROVE OF MARS INTERVENED BETWEEN BY HIS ADVICE THE HEROES HAD SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE BENCHES OF THE GALLEY
4051-11218-0062 HELD PERPENDICULARLY READY TO LET FALL INTO THE WATER AS JASON DREW NEAR HE HEARD THE TALKING IMAGE CALLING TO HIM WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY EAGERNESS IN ITS GRAVE SWEET VOICE MAKE HASTE PRINCE JASON FOR YOUR LIFE MAKE HASTE
4137-11701-0000 AND NOW SAID CORONEL WE'D BETTER DECIDE WHAT TO DO BUT I DON'T MIND WHAT WE DO NOW SAID HYACINTH HAPPILY SHE MAY HAVE THE THRONE AND FATHER AND UDO AND
4137-11701-0001 THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO JOLLY WE CAN DO WHAT WE LIKE AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT DOESN'T COME OFF SO JUST FOR FUN LET'S THINK OF SOMETHING TO PAY HER OUT I FEEL I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY TO DAY ALL RIGHT WE WON'T HURT HER WE'LL HUMOUR HER
4137-11701-0002 WE WILL BE HER MOST HUMBLE OBEDIENT SERVANTS SHE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING SHE WANTS INCLUDING PRINCE UDO SMILED HYACINTH THAT'S A SPLENDID IDEA WE'LL MAKE HER HAVE UDO
4137-11701-0003 IT WILL ANNOY YOUR FATHER BUT ONE CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY OH I CAN SEE MYSELF ENJOYING THIS THEY GOT UP AND WANDERED BACK ALONG WIGGS'S PATH HAND IN HAND I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO LEAVE THE FOREST SAID HYACINTH
4137-11701-0004 IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW BUT ALL OUR LIFE TOGETHER HAS BEEN IN THE FOREST AND I'M JUST A LITTLE AFRAID OF THE WORLD
4137-11701-0005 BE VERY CLOSE CORONEL SHE WHISPERED AND THEN THEY WALKED OUT TOGETHER IF ANY OF THE SERVANTS AT THE PALACE WERE SURPRISED TO SEE CORONEL THEY DID NOT SHOW IT AFTER ALL THAT WAS THEIR BUSINESS
4137-11701-0006 PRINCE CORONEL WILL BE STAYING HERE SAID THE PRINCESS PREPARE A ROOM FOR HIM AND SOME REFRESHMENT FOR US BOTH AND IF THEY DISCUSSED THOSE THINGS IN THE SERVANTS HALLS OF THOSE DAYS
4137-11701-0007 NO DOUBT THEY TOLD EACH OTHER THAT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH BLESS HER PRETTY FACE HAD FOUND HER MAN AT LAST
4137-11701-0008 BUT I GET NO ASSISTANCE FROM ROGER AT THIS POINT HE PRETENDS THAT HE HAS A MIND FAR ABOVE THE GOSSIP OF THE LOWER ORDERS I SAY SAID CORONEL AS THEY WENT UP THE GRAND STAIRCASE I AM NOT A PRINCE YOU KNOW DON'T SAY I HAVE DECEIVED YOU
4137-11701-0009 YOU ARE MY PRINCE SAID HYACINTH PROUDLY MY DEAR I AM A KING AMONG MEN TO DAY AND YOU ARE MY QUEEN BUT THAT'S IN OUR OWN SPECIAL COUNTRY OF TWO IF YOU ARE SO PARTICULAR SAID HYACINTH WITH A SMILE
4137-11701-0010 FATHER WILL MAKE YOU A PROPER PRINCE DIRECTLY HE COMES BACK WILL HE THAT'S WHAT I'M WONDERING YOU SEE HE DOESN'T KNOW YET ABOUT OUR LITTLE PRESENT TO THE COUNTESS BUT IT IS QUITE TIME WE GOT BACK TO BELVANE WE HAVE LEFT HER ALONE TOO LONG
4137-11701-0011 IT WAS MORE THAN UDO DID JUST NOW HE WAS WITH HER IN HER GARDEN TELLING HER FOR THE FIFTH TIME AN EXTRAORDINARILY DULL STORY ABOUT AN ENCOUNTER OF HIS WITH A DRAGON APPARENTLY IN ITS DOTAGE TO WHICH BELVANE WAS LISTENING WITH AN INTEREST WHICH SURPRISED EVEN THE NARRATOR
4137-11701-0012 AND THEN SAID UDO I JUMPED QUICKLY TO THE RIGHT AND WHIRLING MY NO WAIT A BIT THAT WAS LATER I JUMPED QUICKLY TO MY LEFT YES I REMEMBER IT NOW IT WAS MY LEFT I JUMPED QUICKLY TO MY LEFT AND WHIRLING MY
4137-11701-0013 HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AT THE EXPRESSION ON BELVANE'S FACE SHE WAS LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER AT SOMETHING BEHIND HIM WHY WHOEVER IS THIS SHE SAID GETTING TO HER FEET BEFORE UDO HAD COMPLETELY CLEARED HIS MIND OF HIS DRAGON
4137-11701-0014 THE PRINCESS AND CORONEL WERE UPON THEM AH COUNTESS I THOUGHT WE SHOULD FIND YOU TOGETHER SAID HYACINTH ARCHLY LET ME PRESENT TO YOU MY FRIEND THE DUKE CORONEL

4137-11701-0016 A DIFFERENT THING COUNTESS FROM WHEN I LAST SAW HIM
4137-11701-0017 AH WHAT A MIRACLE WORKER TRUE LOVE IS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH MADE BELVANE SO REMARKABLE WAS THAT SHE WAS NEVER AFRAID OF REMAINING SILENT WHEN SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO SAY

4137-11701-0022 MORE THAN ADVISER SHE GUESSED TO HYACINTH HER OWN POSITION WOULD NOT BE IN MUCH DOUBT AND AS FOR THE KING IT MIGHT BE MONTHS BEFORE HE CAME BACK AND WHEN HE DID COME WOULD HE REMEMBER HER
4137-11701-0023 WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE KNOWN YET SHE SAID SHYLY BUT YOU HAVE GUESSED OUR SECRET YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS SHE LOOKED MODESTLY AT THE GROUND AND FEELING FOR HER RELUCTANT LOVER'S HAND WENT ON

4137-11701-0044 UDO DROPPED UNDECIDEDLY INTO A SEAT THIS WANTED THINKING OUT THE COUNTESS WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER AFTER ALL AND SHE EVIDENTLY ADORED HIM OF COURSE THAT WAS NOT SURPRISING THE QUESTION WAS
4137-11701-0045 WAS IT FAIR TO DISAPPOINT ONE WHO HAD PERHAPS SOME LITTLE GROUNDS FOR AFTER ALL HE HAD BEEN NO MORE GALLANT THAN WAS CUSTOMARY FROM A PRINCE AND A GENTLEMAN TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IT WAS HER OWN FAULT IF SHE HAD MISTAKEN HIS INTENTIONS
4137-11701-0046 OF COURSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE LEFT EURALIA LONG AGO BUT HE HAD STAYED ON AND WELL DECIDEDLY SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL PERHAPS HE HAD PAID RATHER TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT AND HE HAD CERTAINLY NEGLECTED THE PRINCESS A LITTLE
4137-11701-0047 AFTER ALL AGAIN WHY NOT MARRY THE COUNTESS IT WAS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THERE WAS ANYTHING IN CORONEL'S NONSENSE BUT ONE NEVER KNEW NOT THAT HE WAS MARRYING HER OUT OF FEAR NO CERTAINLY NOT IT WAS SIMPLY A CHIVALROUS WHIM ON HIS PART
4137-11701-0048 THE POOR WOMAN HAD MISUNDERSTOOD HIM AND SHE SHOULD NOT BE DISAPPOINTED SHE SEEMS FOND OF FLOWERS SAID CORONEL YOU OUGHT TO MAKE THE PALACE GARDEN LOOK BEAUTIFUL BETWEEN YOU NOW UNDERSTAND CLEARLY CORONEL

4137-11702-0002 HENRY SMALLNOSE A BOWMAN OF CONSIDERABLE PROMISE HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY THE ONE CASUALTY OF WAR WHILE SPYING OUT THE LAND IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INVASION
4137-11702-0003 HE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED BY THE CHIEF ARMOURER OF BARODIA AT FULL LENGTH ON THE WET GRASS SEARCHING FOR TRACKS THE CHIEF ARMOURER A KINDLY MAN
4137-11702-0004 HENRY HAVING CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE CHIEF ARMOURER'S DAUGHTER HAD ACCEPTED WITHOUT ANY FALSE PRIDE AND HAD FREQUENTLY DROPPED IN TO SUPPER THEREAFTER NOW THAT THE WAR WAS OVER HE FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT TEAR HIMSELF AWAY

4137-11702-0007 POOR LITTLE HYACINTH LEFT ALL ALONE BUT THERE SHE HAD HAD THE COUNTESS BELVANE A WOMAN OF GREAT EXPERIENCE TO HELP HER BELVANE SHOULD HE RISK IT HOW MUCH HAD SHE THOUGHT OF HIM WHILE HE WAS AWAY
4137-11702-0008 HYACINTH WOULD BE GROWING UP AND GETTING MARRIED SOON LIFE WOULD BE LONELY IN EURALIA THEN UNLESS SHOULD HE RISK IT
