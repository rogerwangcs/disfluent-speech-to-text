8747-293952-0000 THINGS WENT VERY SMOOTHLY AT GORE HALL AFTER DURHAM HAD ESTABLISHED LUCY AS ITS MISTRESS DURING THE ABSENCE OF BERNARD THE GIRL HERSELF FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT HER COUSIN WAS DEAD AND ASSUMED DEEP MOURNING
8747-293952-0001 AND FELT HIS LOSS DEEPLY IT WAS HER OUTSPOKEN AFFECTION THAT PROVOKED A QUARREL BETWEEN HER AND JULIUS AND WHICH LED TO THE BREAKING OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT LUCY HAD A HIGH TEMPER WHICH HAD BEEN KEPT IN SUBJECTION DURING THE LIFE OF SIR SIMON
8747-293952-0002 BUT NOW THAT SHE TASTED THE SWEETS OF POWER SHE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO ALLOW JULIUS TO TREAT HER AS HE CHOSE MISSUS GILROY CAME BACK FROM HER VISIT TO THE LAWYER
8747-293952-0003 SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD GONE TOO FAR AND HAD GIVEN DURHAM AN INKLING AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MICHAEL HAVING MASQUERADED AS BERNARD
8747-293952-0004 KNOWING THAT SHE HAD MARRIED WALTER GORE AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A FLAW IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES UPON WHICH SHE BUILT HER CLAIM YET SHE TRUSTED TO HER OWN CLEVERNESS TO CONCEAL THIS FROM THE TOO CLEVER LAWYER BUT APART FROM THIS
8747-293952-0005 THE FACT THAT HE SUSPECTED SOMEONE OF PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS BERNARD STARTLED HER AND OPENED AN ABYSS AT HER FEET ON LEAVING THE OFFICE SHE JUDGED IT BEST TO LOWER HER CREST FOR THE MOMENT AND TO WAIT PATIENTLY TO SEE WHAT WOULD TRANSPIRE
8747-293952-0006 MISSUS GILROY WAS A WELL EDUCATED WOMAN AND VERY ASTUTE THEREFORE SHE HOPED TO GAIN HER ENDS BY CRAFT IF NOT BY FORCE SO FAR SHE HAD FAILED BUT SHE DID NOT INTEND TO ABANDON HER CLAIM
8747-293952-0007 FOR ONE FAILURE AS IT WAS SHE CAME BACK TO THE HALL AND BEHAVED HERSELF MUCH BETTER THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE SHE WAS RESPECTFUL TO LUCY AND DID NOT DISPLAY HER IMPATIENCE OF COMMANDS THAT
8747-293952-0008 SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN MEEKER AND ALTHOUGH MISS RANDOLPH DID NOT LIKE OR TRUST THE WOMAN SHE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH HER IN ANY WAY LUCY SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM THE SHOCK OF SIR SIMON'S TRAGIC DEATH
8747-293952-0009 AND FROM THE SUPPOSED DEATH OF SIR BERNARD IN FACT THE MATTER SO PREYED ON HER NERVES THAT SHE BECAME PROSTRATE AND DOCTOR PAYNE HAD TO BE CALLED IN HE WAS A HANDSOME AND POPULAR YOUNG DOCTOR WHO HAD PRACTICED IN HURSETON
8747-293952-0010 HE WAS NATURALLY VERY PLEASED AND WAS VERY ATTENTIVE A COMPLETE REST IS WHAT YOU NEED HE SAID TO MISS RANDOLPH
8747-293952-0011 AND I WILL GIVE YOU A TONIC NATURALLY YOU SUFFER FROM THE TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SIR SIMON'S DEATH HE THOUGHT A MOMENT
8747-293952-0012 A CHEERFUL COMPANION WOULD DO YOU GOOD SHALL I ASK MISS MALLESON TO COME OVER IS SHE CHEERFUL ASKED LUCY LANGUIDLY I FEAR NOT DOCTOR SHE WAS ENGAGED TO MY COUSIN AND HIS DEATH HAS MADE HER SAD
8747-293952-0013 PROBABLY BUT SHE BEARS UP WONDERFULLY BUT THAT SHE IS IN MOURNING ONE WOULD HARDLY GUESS SHE HAD SUSTAINED SUCH A LOSS WAS SHE VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MISTER GORE YES
8747-293952-0014 I NEVER SAW A MORE ATTACHED COUPLE DID YOU EVER MEET HIM ONCE AT MISS PLANTAGENET'S YOU KNOW I AM GREAT FRIENDS WITH THE OLD LADY I OFTEN VISIT HER NOT PROFESSIONALLY FOR SHE IS AS HEALTHY AS A TROUT IN A POND
8747-293952-0015 IS ALICE MISS MALLESON ALSO WELL IN VERY GOOD HEALTH AND APPEARS RESIGNED TO HER LOSS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT IT MORE SAID LUCY PERPLEXED
8747-293952-0016 ALICE HAS SUCH A TENDER HEART DOCTOR PAYNE WAS DOUBTFUL SO FAR AS HE SAW MISS MALLESON WAS REMARKABLY CHEERFUL UNDER HER SORROW SHE IS PHILOSOPHIC MISS RANDOLPH
8747-293952-0017 I THINK HOWEVER IF YOU WOULD HAVE HER OVER TO SEE YOU IT WOULD DO BOTH HER AND YOURSELF GOOD I SHALL WRITE A NOTE TO HER TO DAY SAID LUCY I AM VERY FOND OF HER AND WE GET ON VERY WELL TOGETHER
8747-293952-0018 POOR ALICE I WISH BERNARD HAD LIVED
8747-293952-0019 RISING TO TAKE HIS LEAVE IF HE WAS GUILTY AH SAID LUCY RAISING HERSELF WITH ANIMATION FROM THE SOFA UPON WHICH SHE WAS LYING IF HE WAS GUILTY
8747-293952-0020 I DO NOT BELIEVE HE WAS
8747-293952-0021 BUT HE COULD NOT ALWAYS CONTROL IT AND WAS A KIND HEARTED BOY HE IS INNOCENT I AM SURE HOW ARE YOU SURE MY DEAR LUCY ASKED A THIRD VOICE AND SHE LOOKED UP TO SEE JULIUS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY
8747-293952-0022 HE CAME FORWARD FORGIVE ME IF I HEARD A FEW WORDS OF YOUR CONVERSATION BUT I HAVE JUST COME IN DOCTOR PAYNE I HOPE I SEE YOU WELL QUITE WELL SAID THE DOCTOR WHO DID NOT LIKE BERYL THINKING HIM
8747-293952-0023 IN SCHOOLBOY PHRASE A SNEAK I AM JUST GOING MISTER BERYL ARE YOU ILL LUCY ASKED BERYL WITH AFFECTION I HAVE AN ATTACK OF NERVES SHE REPLIED PETTISHLY

8747-293952-0025 REST AND CHEERFUL COMPANY MISS MALLESON'S FOR CHOICE HE DEPARTED SMILING AND THEY HEARD HIM GALLOP OFF WHEN THE SOUND OF THE HORSE'S HOOFS DIED AWAY
8747-293952-0026 WHY DO YOU THINK BERNARD IS INNOCENT HE ASKED BECAUSE IF HE IS GUILTY HIS ACTION GIVES THE LIE TO HIS WHOLE LIFE JULIUS SHE REPLIED RAISING HERSELF ON HER ELBOW I CAN'T BELIEVE HE KILLED MY UNCLE
8747-293952-0027 SIR SIMON IS NOT YOUR UNCLE SAID BERYL JEALOUSLY YOU ARE ONLY A DISTANT RELATIVE PERHAPS MY MARRIAGE WITH YOU MAY MAKE ME A NEARER ONE
8747-293952-0028 IF WE EVER DO MARRY SAID JULIUS GLOOMILY SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I SHOULD LIKE TO BREAK THE ENGAGEMENT JULIUS WE WERE NEVER SUITED TO ONE ANOTHER BERYL'S VANITY WAS HURT
8747-293952-0029 WHY DID YOU ACCEPT ME THEN WHAT ELSE COULD I DO IT WAS SIR SIMON'S WISH THAT WE SHOULD MARRY AND OWING TO MY CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER DURING HIS LIFE I WAS MERELY A PUPPET
8747-293952-0030 ALTHOUGH YOU SWORE FOR AN HOUR
8747-293952-0031 YOU TOLD SIR SIMON ABOUT BERNARD BEING IN LOVE WITH ALICE THAT THE POOR BOY MIGHT BE DISINHERITED BERYL DID NOT DENY THE CHARGE I BELIEVE YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH BERNARD YOURSELF HE SAID
8747-293952-0032 NO BERNARD AND I ARE LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER BUT HE IS DEAD
8747-293952-0033 LUCY SAT UP ON THE SOFA AND PUSHED THE LOOSE HAIR BACK FROM HER FOREHEAD WHY DO YOU SAY THAT SHE ASKED SHARPLY JULIUS STARED AT THE FIRE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND DURHAM'S ATTITUDE HE SAID EVASIVELY
8747-293952-0034 HE MUST KNOW THAT BERNARD IS DEAD SEEING THAT THE COAT AND HAT WERE FOUND ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER NO MAN COULD HAVE LIVED IN THE COLD AND THE FOG YET IF DURHAM WAS SURE HE WOULD NOT HOLD THE ESTATE AGAINST BERNARD'S COMING
8747-293952-0035 MISTER DURHAM REQUIRES PROOF OF THE DEATH REJOINED LUCY SHARPLY AND UNTIL THEN HE IS BOUND TO ADMINISTER THE ESTATE ACCORDING TO THE WILL AS BERNARD'S BODY HAS NOT BEEN FOUND
8747-293952-0036 THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT HE MAY HAVE ESCAPED I SINCERELY TRUST NOT AH YOU ALWAYS HATED BERNARD ON THE CONTRARY I SPEAK FOR HIS GOOD
8747-293952-0037 WHAT'S THE USE OF HIS COMING TO LIFE WHEN HE MUST SUFFER FOR HIS CRIME
8747-293952-0038 YOU HAVE NO GROUNDS FOR SAYING THAT SAID JULIUS PALE WITH RAGE I DON'T NEED GROUNDS RETORTED THE GENUINE WOMAN BERNARD ALWAYS WAS AS KIND HEARTED AS YOU WERE AND ARE THE REVERSE
8747-293952-0039 I AM NOT HARD HEARTED SNAPPED BERYL I ALWAYS DO GOOD
8747-293952-0040 NOT ALWAYS FOR INSTANCE I AM DOWN HERE TO GET A SMALL BOY A POST WITH MISS PLANTAGENET AS A PAGE THAT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU SAID LUCY SCORNFULLY AH YOU SEE I CAN DO A KIND ACTION
8747-293952-0041 THIS BOY IS A GRANDSON OF LORD CONNISTON'S HOUSEKEEPER MISSUS MOON AT COVE CASTLE SAID LUCY WITH SOME COLOR IN HER FACE I KNOW DO YOU KNOW LORD CONNISTON ASKED JULIUS SUSPICIOUSLY I HAVE MET HIM ONCE
8747-293952-0042 HE SEEMS TO BE A MOST DELIGHTFUL FELLOW WHAT A DELIGHTFUL SPEECH FOR A LADY SAID BERYL CONNISTON IS A SCAMP I HEARD HE ENLISTED IN THE LANCERS IT SHOWS HOW BRAVE HE IS EVERY MAN WORTH CALLING A MAN
8747-293952-0043 SHOULD GO TO THE FRONT PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO GO SNEERED JULIUS YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THE PLUCK SAID LUCY QUICKLY ALL YOUR ENDS IN LIFE ARE GAINED BY CUNNING
8747-293952-0044 LUCY IF YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT BEGAN BERYL AND THEN RESTRAINED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT IT IS NO USE OUR QUARRELLING LET ME SHOW YOU THAT I AM NOT SO CARELESS OF OTHERS OR SO HARD HEARTED AS I SEEM TO BE
8747-293952-0045 MISS PLANTAGENET WANTS A PAGE I FOUND THIS LAD IN LONDON SELLING MATCHES HE WAS A MESSENGER BOY AT A TOBACCONIST CALLED TABERLEY AND LORD CONNISTON GOT HIM TURNED OUT OF THE SITUATION
8747-293952-0046 THE BOY TOLD ME HIMSELF HE WILL TELL YOU IF YOU LIKE TO SEE HIM I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM LORD CONNISTON IS TOO KIND A MAN TO BEHAVE IN THAT WAY HE WAS FOND OF BERNARD
8747-293952-0047 AND THAT MAKES HIM PERFECT IN YOUR EYES SAID BERYL LOOKING SAVAGE SEE HERE LUCY CONNISTON HAS LEFT THE ARMY SO YOU SEE HE IS NOT SO BRAVE AS YOU THINK
8747-293952-0048 HE LEFT SO AS TO SEEK AFTER BERNARD SAID LUCY QUICKLY MISTER DURHAM TOLD ME SO
8747-293952-0049 AND I BELIEVE BERNARD MAY BE ALIVE AFTER ALL IN WHICH CASE YOU WOULD GIVE HIM UP TO THE POLICE NO SAID JULIUS WITH AN EMOTION WHICH DID HIM CREDIT I SHOULD NEVER BETRAY HIM
8747-293952-0050 LUCY IF YOU CAN FIND OUT FROM LORD CONNISTON OR DURHAM THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP HIM HOW CAN YOU HELP HIM WHEN YOU BELIEVE HIM GUILTY I MIGHT HELP HIM TO ESCAPE
8747-293952-0051 I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM HANGED HE WON'T BE HANGED IF LORD CONNISTON AND MISTER DURHAM CAN SAVE HIM AH JULIUS STARTED TO HIS FEET THEN HE IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0052 I CAN'T SAY I HAVE NO REASON TO THINK HE IS BUT I AM HOPING AGAINST HOPE SAID LUCY RISING I MERELY STATE WHAT WAS SAID MISTER DURHAM AND LORD CONNISTON BOTH TOLD ALICE THAT BERNARD WAS INNOCENT
8747-293952-0053 THEY WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT SNEERED BERYL WITH A WHITE FACE I BELIEVE THE FELLOW IS ALIVE AFTER ALL
8747-293952-0054 AND THEN ASKED LUCY STARTING UP AND FACING BERYL
8747-293952-0055 AH YOU WOULD MAKE HIM PAY MONEY TO SAVE HIMSELF I HAVE A RIGHT TO A PORTION OF THE ESTATE YOU HAVE NOT SAID MISS RANDOLPH CLENCHING HER FISTS AND ALL HER LANGUOR GONE BERNARD IS THE OWNER OF GORE HALL
8747-293952-0056 AND OF ALL THE PROPERTY AND OF THE TITLE ALSO
8747-293952-0057 HIS NAME WILL BE CLEARED AND THEN YOU WILL THROW ME OVER AND TRY TO BECOME LADY GORE I THROW YOU OVER NOW SAID LUCY LOSING HER TEMPER AND COLORING HOTLY HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THIS JULIUS
8747-293952-0058 I WILL NO LONGER BE BOUND TO YOU I NEVER LOVED YOU BUT I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO SEE THE BEST SIDE OF YOU BUT YOU HAVE NO GOOD SIDE YOU ARE A MEAN COWARDLY SERPENT AND IF BERNARD IS ALIVE I SHALL DO MY BEST TO DEFEND HIM
8747-293952-0059 FROM YOUR SNARES BUT LUCY DON'T SPEAK TO ME
8747-293952-0060 I GIVE YOU BACK YOUR RING HERE IT IS SHE WRENCHED IT FROM HER FINGER NOW LEAVE THE HOUSE MISTER BERYL I AM MISTRESS HERE JULIUS LOOKED AT THE RING WHICH SHE HAD THROWN AT HIS FEET AND LAUGHED
8747-293952-0061 YOU TAKE A HIGH TONE HE SAID SNEERINGLY BUT REMEMBER THAT IF BERNARD IS DEAD THE MONEY GOES TO CHARITIES SO MUCH THE BETTER YOU DO NOT GET IT NOR YOU EITHER
8747-293952-0062 YOU WILL HAVE TO TURN OUT OF THIS LUXURIOUS HOME AND LIVE ON THE PITTANCE SIR SIMON LEFT YOU WOULD I BE BETTER OFF IF I MARRIED YOU I THINK YOU WOULD I HAVE NOT MUCH MONEY NOW BUT I WILL HAVE SOME
8747-293952-0063 A GREAT DEAL SOME DAY BY BLACKMAILING BERNARD SAID LUCY INDIGNANTLY JULIUS PICKED UP THE RING AND SLIPPED IT INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET CALMLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0064 BUT THE FACT OF CONNISTON LEAVING THE ARMY AND FROM DURHAM'S ATTITUDE I SHREWDLY SUSPECT HE IS AND IN HIDING
8747-293952-0065 AND THEN IT DEPENDS UPON HIM WHETHER HE IS HANGED OR PREFERS TO LIVE ABROAD ON A PORTION OF HIS MONEY THE LESSER PORTION I KNOW THE PRICE OF YOUR SILENCE SAID LUCY VEHEMENTLY YOU WILL WANT THE HALL AND A LARGE INCOME
8747-293952-0066 ALL I CAN GET REJOINED BERYL QUIETLY AND YOU HAVE REFUSED TO SHARE MY FORTUNE WITH ME YES I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU AND REMEMBER THAT IF I CATCH YOU PLOTTING I WILL TELL MISTER DURHAM
8747-293952-0067 YOU CAN TELL HIM THE WHOLE OF THIS CONVERSATION SNARLED BERYL I AM NOT AFRAID OF DURHAM IF BERNARD IS ALIVE HE'LL HAVE TO PAY UP OR BE HANGED HE IS INNOCENT
8747-293952-0068 JULIUS SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WALKED TO THE DOOR THERE HE PAUSED TO UTTER A FINAL INSULTING SPEECH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU INTEND TO MARRY BERNARD OR LORD CONNISTON HE SAID BUT I WISH
8747-293952-0069 WHICH EVER IT IS JOY OF A SPITFIRE AND AN HONEST WOMAN SAID MISS RANDOLPH WRATHFULLY FOR THE REFERENCE TO CONNISTON TOUCHED HER NEARLY
8747-293952-0070 BUT YOU GO TOO FAST YOU CAN'T YET PROVE THAT BERNARD LIVES I GO TO DO SO SNEERED JULIUS AND BOWED HIMSELF IRONICALLY OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING LUCY FURIOUS BOTH WITH HIM AND WITH HERSELF
8747-293952-0071 SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HERSELF BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT IN SPEAKING OF CONNISTON SHE HAD COLORED AND AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE GREATLY ADMIRED THE YOUNG LORD EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD ONLY MET ONCE
8747-293952-0072 FOR CONNISTON WAS ONE OF THOSE IRRESISTIBLE MEN WHO APPEAL TO WOMEN LUCY THOUGHT BUT IT MATTERS LITTLE WHAT SHE THOUGHT ALL SHE KNEW WAS THAT HER ENGAGEMENT TO JULIUS WHICH HAD ALWAYS WEIGHED ON HER CONSCIENCE WAS AT AN END
8747-293952-0073 I AM FREE NOW FREE SHE SAID STRETCHING HER HANDS OH WHAT AN ESCAPE I HAVE HAD FROM THAT WICKED MAN HE HAS SHOWN HIS HAND TOO PLAINLY I WILL PUT MISTER DURHAM ON HIS GUARD AND
8747-293952-0074 HERE SHE BLUSHED AND LORD CONNISTON JULIUS WALKING TOWARDS THE BOWER WAS ALSO ANGRY WITH HIMSELF AS LUCY THOUGHT HE HAD SHOWN HIS HAND TOO CLEARLY
8747-293952-0075 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HE CONSIDERED TO HAVE HELD MY TONGUE I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD SHE NOT GOADED ME INTO SPEECH SHE WILL TELL DURHAM AND THAT INTERFERING CONNISTON AND PUT THEM ON THEIR GUARD WELL
8747-293952-0076 HE LAUGHED AND LOOKED AT THE SMALL BOY TROTTING BESIDE HIM I AM EQUAL TO BOTH THE BOY WAS A HANDSOME INNOCENT LOOKING LITTLE FELLOW RATHER UNDERSIZED
8747-293952-0077 WITH HIS CLEAR SKIN HIS FAIR HAIR AND WIDE BLUE EYES HE LOOKED LIKE THE CONVENTIONAL PICTURE OF A CHERUB
8747-293952-0078 BUT HIS MIND HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO WORK ON HIS FACE AND THE MASK OF HIS CHILDHOOD FOR HE WAS ONLY THIRTEEN CONCEALED HIS EVIL NATURE SUCCESSFULLY IN A FEW YEARS WHEN HIS PASSIONS WORKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE MASK HIS FACE
8747-293952-0079 WOULD BE WRINKLED AND SINFUL HIS MIND WOULD HAVE MARKED PLAINLY ITS SIGNET ON THE SMOOTH SURFACE BUT AT PRESENT HE LOOKED CHARMINGLY INNOCENT ALTHOUGH HE ALREADY KNEW MUCH MORE ABOUT LIFE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM
8747-293952-0080 JULIUS IN ORDER THAT THE LAD MIGHT MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON MISS PLANTAGENET HAD DRESSED HIM IN A NEW SUIT AND PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR MUCH OF THE BOY REMAINED IN THIS PRECOCIOUS CRIMINAL YOUNG JERRY TROTTED ALONG SMILING
8747-293952-0081 JERRY SAID BERYL LOOKING DOWN MIND YOU ARE NICE TO THE OLD LADY JERRY TOSSED HIS FAIR CURLS AND LOOKED ROGUISH OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT MISTER BERYL ALL OLD LADIES TAKE TO ME
8747-293952-0082 THEY THINK I'M A KIND OF HOLY BILL AND I LET THEM THINK SO IT PAYS JERRY YOU ARE A YOUNG SCAMP OF THE WORST THE BOY CHUCKLED AS THOUGH HE HAD RECEIVED A COMPLIMENT I LIKE DOING THINGS HE EXPLAINED FRANKLY IT'S FUN
8747-293952-0083 IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR VICTORIA
8747-293952-0084 YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SUCH THINGS CORRECTED THE RESPECTABLE MISTER BERYL SEVERELY I KNOW A JOLLY SIGHT MORE THAN YOU THINK SAID THE URCHIN UNDER HIS BREATH AND PRODUCING A CIGARETTE JULIUS TOOK IT FROM HIM
8747-293952-0085 AND DULL SAID JERRY PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LORD WHAT A BORE STOPPING WITH HER WILL BE BUT I CAN NIP OVER AND SEE VICTORIA WHEN I LIKE AND KEEP AN EYE ON LORD CONNISTON AS I TOLD YOU
8747-293952-0086 I'M FLY SAID MASTER MOON AND BEGAN WHISTLING JULIUS LOOKED AT HIM WITH SATISFACTION HE INTENDED THAT THE BOY SHOULD REMAIN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO AS TO KEEP WATCH ON CONNISTON
8747-293952-0087 ON DURHAM AND ON ALICE MALLESON FOR THIS LAST REASON HE WAS INTRODUCING HIM INTO THE HOUSE IF BERNARD WERE ALIVE AS JULIUS BEGAN TO SUSPECT HE WOULD COME TO ONE OF THESE THREE PEOPLE AND THEN JERRY WOULD AT ONCE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT
8747-293952-0088 MISS BERENGARIA WAS AS USUAL IN THE GARDEN LOOKING AFTER THE WELL BEING OF SOME WHITE CHRYSANTHEMUMS SHE RAISED HER HEAD WHEN SHE SAW HER VISITORS AND A LOOK OF ANNOYANCE CROSSED HER FACE WHEN SHE SAW MISTER BERYL
8747-293952-0089 AND BUT FOR THE SAKE OF ALICE SHE WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO LET HIM ENTER THE BOWER AS IT WAS AND WITH GREAT DIPLOMACY SO GREAT THAT IT DECEIVED EVEN THE ASTUTE BERYL SHE ASKED HIM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE
8747-293952-0090 LUCKILY ALICE WAS OUT OF THE WAY HAVING GONE TO PAY A VISIT BUT SHE WAS EXPECTED BACK MOMENTARILY AND MISS BERENGARIA WISHED TO GET RID OF JULIUS BEFORE THE GIRL RETURNED SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONCEAL HER REAL FEELINGS BUT
8747-293952-0091 ALICE BEING SO YOUNG AND IMPULSIVE MIGHT SHOW HER DISLIKE TOO PLAINLY AND PUT BERYL ON HIS GUARD WHO IS THIS YOU HAVE HERE ASKED MISS PLANTAGENET PUTTING ON HER SPECTACLES AND SURVEYING JERRY WITH ADMIRATION WHAT A PRETTY LAD
8747-293952-0092 HE IS A LAD I WISH YOU TO HELP SAID BERYL BLANDLY LAST TIME WE MET MISS PLANTAGENET YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANTED A PAGE NOT EXACTLY A PAGE SAID THE OLD DAME RUBBING HER NOSE
8747-293952-0093 A SURE SIGN SHE WAS PERPLEXED MERELY A BOY TO SEE AFTER THE FOWLS AND TO WAIT ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN NECESSARY I LOVE FOWLS SAID JERRY SWEETLY AND LOOKING AS INNOCENT AS A BABE AND DOGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT

8747-293952-0098 I SAW HIS LORDSHIP DRESSED AS A SOLDIER HE SNUFFLED AND I TOLD MISTER BERYL HIS LORDSHIP WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE GOT ME TURNED OFF SAYING I WAS UNGRATEFUL
8747-293952-0099 YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID MISS BERENGARIA ANGRILY YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL WHAT LORD CONNISTON WISHED KEPT SECRET IT WAS ONLY A FREAK ON HIS PART HE LEFT THE ARMY AT MY REQUEST
8747-293952-0100 AT YOUR REQUEST SAID JULIUS LOOKING AT HER DIRECTLY FOREARMED AS SHE WAS MISS BERENGARIA WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BERNARD'S SECRET FLUSHED THROUGH HER WITHERED SKIN
8747-293952-0101 BUT TURNED THE CONVERSATION DEFIANTLY
8747-293952-0102 YES SWEET LADY DON'T TALK LIKE THAT CHILD CALL ME MA'AM
8747-293952-0103 MISTER BERYL SUCH A KIND GENTLEMAN MA'AM SAID YOU WOULD HELP ME I WILL SO LONG AS YOU ARE HONEST JERRY THRUST HIS TONGUE IN HIS CHEEK BUT JULIUS ANSWERED

8747-293952-0109 THEN HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND THE OLD LADY WATCHED HIM GO
