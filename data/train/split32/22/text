6272-70168-0000 INSTEAD OF MY HEART LEAPING FOR JOY AS I HAD EXPECTED A SUDDEN INDIFFERENCE FILLED IT I FELT AVERSE TO THE CHANGE FROM THE NARROW WAYS OF BARMOUTH WHICH FOR THE MOMENT I REGRETTED
6272-70168-0001 WHEN I ENTERED THE HOUSE AND SAW MOTHER IN HER OLD PLACE HER SURROUNDINGS UNALTERED I SUFFERED A DISAPPOINTMENT I HAD NOT HAD THE POWER OF TRANSFERRING THE ATMOSPHERE OF MY YEAR'S MISERY TO SURREY
6272-70168-0002 I HEARD THE WONTED SOUND OF THE BANGING OF DOORS THE DOORS AT GRAND'THER'S I MUSED HAD LIST NAILED ROUND THEIR EDGES BUT THEN HE HAD THE LIST BEING A TAILOR I VUM SAID TEMPERANCE WITH HER HAND ON HER HIP
6272-70168-0003 AND NOT OFFERING TO APPROACH ME YOUR HAIR IS AS THICK AS A MOP HEPSEY RUBBING HER FINGERS AGAINST HER THUMB REMARKED THAT SHE HOPED LEARNING HAD NOT TAKEN AWAY MY APPETITE
6272-70168-0004 IS IT BEST TO COOK MORE MISSUS MORGESON
6272-70168-0005 THE BOY BY NAME CHARLES CAME TO SEE THE NEW ARRIVAL BUT SMITTEN WITH DIFFIDENCE CREPT UNDER THE TABLE AND EXAMINED ME FROM HIS RETREAT
6272-70168-0006 INQUIRED MOTHER HE IS GETTING HIS DOUBLE TEETH OH YES AND WHERE'S VERONICA SHE'S UP GARRET WRITING GEOGRAPHY AND TOLD ME NOTHING IN THE WORLD MUST DISTURB HER TILL SHE HAD FINISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE CITY OF PALMIRY
6272-70168-0007 SAID TEMPERANCE CALL HER WHEN SUPPER IS READY REPLIED MOTHER WHO ASKED ME TO COME INTO THE BEDROOM WHERE ARTHUR WAS SLEEPING HE WAS A HANDSOME CHILD LARGE AND FAIR AND AS I LIFTED HIS WHITE LAX FINGERS
6272-70168-0008 A TORRENT OF LOVE SWEPT THROUGH ME AND I KISSED HIM I AM AFRAID I MAKE AN IDOL OF HIM CASSY ARE YOU UNHAPPY BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM SO WELL MOTHER AND FEEL THAT YOU MUST MAKE EXPIATION CASSANDRA SHE SPOKE WITH HASTE
6272-70168-0009 DID YOU EXPERIENCE ANY SHADOW OF A CHANGE DURING THE REVIVAL AT BARMOUTH NO MORE THAN THE BABY HERE DID I SHALL HAVE FAITH THOUGH
6272-70168-0010 BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD THE BLESSING OF SO GOOD A MAN AS YOUR GRAND'THER BUT I NEVER HEARD A WORD OF GRAND'THER'S PRAYERS DO YOU REMEMBER HIS VOICE
6272-70168-0011 MY HEARING HIM OR NOT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE SINCE GOD COULD HEAR AND ANSWER GRAND'THER DOES NOT LIKE ME I NEVER PLEASED HIM SHE LOOKED ASTONISHED THEN REFLECTIVE
6272-70168-0012 TEMPERANCE BROUGHT ARTHUR TO THE TABLE HALF ASLEEP BUT HE ROUSED WHEN SHE DRUMMED ON HIS PLATE WITH A SPOON HEPSEY WAS STATIONED BY THE BANNOCK KNIFE IN HAND TO SERVE IT AS WE BEGAN OUR MEAL
6272-70168-0013 VERONICA CAME IN FROM THE KITCHEN WITH A PLATE OF TOASTED CRACKERS SHE SET THE PLATE DOWN AND GRAVELY SHOOK HANDS WITH ME SAYING SHE HAD CONCLUDED TO LIVE ENTIRELY ON TOAST BUT SUPPOSED I WOULD EAT ALL SORTS OF FOOD AS USUAL
6272-70168-0014 HER FACE WAS STILL LONG AND NARROW BUT PRETTIER AND HER LARGE DARK EYES HAD A SLIGHT CAST WHICH GAVE HER FACE AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION DISTANT INDIFFERENT AND SPECULATIVE AS THE EYES WERE
6272-70168-0015 AND ATE IT IN SILENCE THE PLENTY AROUND ME THE EASE AND INDEPENDENCE GAVE ME A DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF COMFORT THE DISHES WERE ODD SOME OF CHINA SOME OF DELF AND WERE CONTINUALLY MOVED OUT OF THEIR PLACES FOR WE HELPED OURSELVES
6272-70168-0016 SHE WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION TO FULFILL HER DUTIES THAT WAY
6272-70168-0017 I GREW BLITHE AS I SAW IT WINKING UNDER THE RAYS OF THE AFTERNOON SUN AND CLAPPING MY HANDS SAID I WAS GLAD TO GET HOME WE LEFT VERONICA AT THE TABLE AND MOTHER RESUMED HER CONVERSATION WITH ME IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
6272-70168-0018 PRESENTLY TEMPERANCE CAME IN WITH CHARLES BRINGING FRESH PLATES AS SOON AS THEY BEGAN THEIR SUPPER VERONICA ASKED TEMPERANCE HOW THE FISH TASTED IS IT SALT MIDDLING HOW IS THE BANNOCK EXCELLENT
6272-70168-0019 THE GLUTTON BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN HERE LONG THEY ARE ALL SO WHEN THEY FIRST COME SHE THEN GAVE HIM A LARGE SLICE OF THE CAKE VERONICA CONTRARY TO HER WONT
6272-70168-0020 I FEEL EVIL STILL YOU KNOW TURNING TO ME THAT MY TEMPER IS WORSE THAN EVER IT IS LIKE A TIGER'S OH VERRY SAID MOTHER NOT QUITE SO BAD YOU ARE TOO HARD UPON YOURSELF
6272-70168-0021 SAY SO TO MY OWN CHILD VERRY TURNED HER FACE TO THE WALL AND SAID NO MORE BUT SHE HAD STARTED A LESS PLEASANT TRAIN OF THOUGHT IT WAS CHANGED AGAIN BY TEMPERANCE COMING WITH LIGHTS
6272-70168-0022 THOUGH THE TALL BRASS LAMPS GLITTERED LIKE GOLD THEIR CIRCLE OF LIGHT WAS SMALL THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM WERE OBSCURE MISTER PARK ENTERING RETREATED INTO ONE AND MOTHER WAS OBLIGED TO FOREGO THE PLEASURE OF UNDRESSING ARTHUR
6272-70168-0023 SO SHE SENT HIM OFF WITH TEMPERANCE AND CHARLES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO ROCK THE CRADLE AS LONG AS HIS BABYSHIP REQUIRED SOON AFTER FATHER CAME AND HEPSEY BROUGHT IN HIS HOT SUPPER WHILE HE WAS EATING IT GRANDFATHER JOHN MORGESON BUSTLED IN
6272-70168-0024 AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME I SAW THAT HIS HAIR HAD WHITENED HE HELD A TASSELED CANE BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND THUMPED THE FLOOR WHENEVER HE ASKED A QUESTION
6272-70168-0025 AND MOTHER LISTENED WITH A VAGUE RESPECTFUL ATTENTION HER HAND WAS PRESSED AGAINST HER BREAST AS IF SHE WERE REPRESSING AN INWARD VOICE WHICH CLAIMED HER ATTENTION
6272-70168-0026 HER HAIR DROPPED ON HER SHOULDER AND LOOKED LIKE A BROWN COILED SERPENT VERONICA WHO HAD BEEN SILENTLY OBSERVING HER ROSE FROM THE SOFA PICKED UP THE COMB AND FASTENED HER HAIR WITHOUT SPEAKING AS SHE PASSED SHE GAVE ME A DARK LOOK
6272-70168-0027 EH VERRY SAID FATHER ARE YOU THERE WERE YOU GLAD TO SEE CASSY HOME AGAIN SHOULD I BE GLAD WHAT CAN SHE DO GRANDFATHER PURSED UP HIS MOUTH
6272-70168-0028 AND TURNED TOWARD MOTHER AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOU UNDERSTAND BRINGING UP CHILDREN DON'T YOU SHE COMPREHENDED HIM AND GIVING HER HEAD A SLIGHT TOSS TOLD VERRY TO GO AND PLAY ON THE PIANO I WAS GOING SHE ANSWERED PETTISHLY
6272-70168-0029 AND DARTING OUT A MOMENT AFTER WE HEARD HER GRANDFATHER WENT AND PRESENTLY MISTER PARK GOT UP IN A LINGERING WAY
6272-70168-0030 JOE BACON MOTHER RETIRED VERRY STILL PLAYED HER TALENT IS WONDERFUL SAID FATHER TAKING THE CIGAR FROM HIS MOUTH BY THE WAY YOU MUST TAKE LESSONS IN MILFORD I WISH YOU WOULD LEARN TO SING
6272-70168-0031 THOUGH THE FIRE HAD GONE OUT THE LAMPS WINKED BRIGHTLY AND FATHER MOVING HIS CIGAR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS MOUTH CHANGED HIS REGARDS FROM ONE LAMP TO THE OTHER AND SAID HE THOUGHT I WAS GROWING TO BE AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL
6272-70168-0032 A VERY STRONG RELATION OF RESERVE GENERALLY EXISTED BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD INSTEAD OF A CONFIDENTIAL ONE AND THE CHILD WAS APT TO DISCOVER THAT RESERVE ON THE PART OF THE PARENT WAS NOT SUPERIORITY BUT COWARDICE OR INDIFFERENCE
6272-70168-0033 LET IT NOT BE SO WITH US WAS HIS CONCLUSION HE THREW AWAY THE STUMP OF HIS CIGAR AND WENT TO FASTEN THE HALL DOOR I TOOK ONE OF THE BRASS LAMPS PROPOSING TO GO TO BED
6272-70168-0034 AS I PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER ENTRY VERONICA OPENED HER DOOR SHE WAS UNDRESSED AND HAD A LITTLE BOOK IN HER HAND WHICH SHE SHOOK AT ME SAYING
6272-70171-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN IT WAS SUNSET WHEN WE ARRIVED IN ROSVILLE AND FOUND MISTER MORGESON WAITING FOR US WITH HIS CARRIAGE AT THE STATION FROM ITS OPEN SIDES
6272-70171-0001 I LOOKED OUT ON A TRANQUIL AGREEABLE LANDSCAPE THERE WAS NOTHING SALINE IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE WESTERN BREEZE WHICH BLEW IN OUR FACES HAD AN EARTHY SCENT WITH FLUCTUATING STREAMS OF ODORS FROM TREES AND FLOWERS
6272-70171-0002 AS WE PASSED THROUGH THE TOWN COUSIN CHARLES POINTED TO THE ACADEMY WHICH STOOD AT THE HEAD OF A GREEN PRETTY HOUSES STOOD ROUND IT AND STREETS BRANCHED FROM IT IN ALL DIRECTIONS FLOWER GARDENS SHRUBBERY AND TREES WERE SCATTERED EVERYWHERE
6272-70171-0003 ROSVILLE WAS LARGER AND HANDSOMER THAN SURREY THAT IS MY HOUSE ON THE RIGHT HE SAID WE LOOKED DOWN THE SHADY STREET THROUGH WHICH WE WERE GOING
6272-70171-0004 AND PEAKED ROOF AND ON THE SIDE TOWARD US A LARGE YARD AND STABLES WE DROVE INTO THE YARD AND A WOMAN CAME OUT ON THE PIAZZA TO RECEIVE US IT WAS MISSUS MORGESON OR MY WIFE COUSIN ALICE
6272-70171-0005 AS MISTER MORGESON INTRODUCED HER GIVING US A CORDIAL WELCOME SHE LED US INTO A PARLOR WHERE TEA WAS WAITING A SERVANT CAME IN FOR OUR BONNETS AND BASKETS COUSIN ALICE BEGGED US TO TAKE TEA AT ONCE
6272-70171-0006 WE WERE HARDLY SEATED WHEN WE HEARD THE CRY OF A YOUNG CHILD SHE LEFT THE TABLE HASTILY TO COME BACK IN A MOMENT WITH AN APOLOGY WHICH SHE MADE TO COUSIN CHARLES RATHER THAN TO US I HAD NEVER SEEN A TABLE SO WELL ARRANGED
6272-70171-0007 SO FASTIDIOUSLY NEAT IT GLITTERED WITH GLASS AND FRENCH CHINA COUSIN CHARLES SENT AWAY A GLASS AND A PLATE FROWNING AT THE GIRL WHO WAITED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECK OR A FLAW IN THEM THE VIANDS WERE AS PRETTY AS THE DISHES
6272-70171-0008 THE LAMB CHOPS WERE FRAGILE THE BREAD WAS DELICIOUS BUT CUT IN TRANSPARENT SLICES AND THE BUTTER PAT WAS NEARLY STAMPED THROUGH WITH ITS BOUQUET OF FLOWERS THIS WAS ALL THE FEAST EXCEPT SPONGE CAKE WHICH FELT LIKE MUSLIN IN THE FINGERS
6272-70171-0009 I COULD HAVE SQUEEZED THE WHOLE OF IT INTO MY MOUTH STILL HUNGRY I OBSERVED THAT COUSIN CHARLES AND ALICE HAD FINISHED AND THOUGH SHE SHOOK HER SPOON IN THE CUP FEIGNING TO CONTINUE AND HE SNIPPED CRUMBS IN HIS PLATE
6272-70171-0010 I FELT CONSTRAINED TO END MY REPAST HE ROSE THEN AND PUSHING BACK FOLDING DOORS WE ENTERED A LARGE ROOM LEAVING ALICE AT THE TABLE WINDOWS EXTENDING TO THE FLOOR OPENING ON THE PIAZZA
6272-70171-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE STREAM OF LIGHT OVER THE CARPET I THOUGHT IT SOMBER AND OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE COTTAGE EXTERIOR
6272-70171-0012 THE FURNITURE WAS DARK THE MANTEL AND TABLE TOPS WERE BLACK MARBLE AND THE VASES AND CANDELABRA WERE BRONZE HE DIRECTED MOTHER'S ATTENTION TO THE PORTRAITS OF HIS CHILDREN EXPLAINING THEM
6272-70171-0013 DARK AND DELICATE BUT TO LOOK AT IT MADE ME SHIVER MOTHER CAME TOWARD US PLEADING FATIGUE AS AN EXCUSE FOR RETIRING AND COUSIN CHARLES CALLED COUSIN ALICE WHO WENT WITH US TO OUR ROOM IN THE MORNING SHE SAID
6272-70171-0014 WE SHOULD SEE HER THREE CHILDREN SHE NEVER LEFT THEM SHE WAS SO AFRAID OF THEIR BEING ILL ALSO TELLING MOTHER THAT SHE WOULD DO ALL IN HER POWER TO MAKE MY STAY IN ROSVILLE PLEASANT AND PROFITABLE AS A MOTHER
6272-70171-0015 SHE COULD APPRECIATE HER ANXIETY AND SADNESS IN LEAVING ME MOTHER THANKED HER WARMLY AND WAS SURE THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY BUT I HAD AN INWARD MISGIVING THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT I HEAR EDWARD SAID ALICE GOOD NIGHT
6272-70171-0016 PRESENTLY A GIRL THE SAME WHO HAD TAKEN OUR BONNETS CAME IN WITH A PITCHER OF WARM WATER AND A PLATE OF SODA BISCUIT SHE DIRECTED US WHERE TO FIND THE APPAREL SHE HAD NICELY SMOOTHED AND FOLDED TOOK OFF THE HANDSOME COUNTERPANE AND THE PILLOWS TRIMMED WITH LACE
6272-70171-0017 PUTTING OTHERS OF A PLAINER MAKE IN THEIR PLACES SHOOK DOWN THE WINDOW CURTAINS ASKED US IF WE WOULD HAVE ANYTHING MORE AND QUIETLY DISAPPEARED I OFFERED MOTHER THE WARM WATER AND APPROPRIATED THE BISCUITS THERE WERE SIX I ATE EVERY ONE
6272-70171-0018 UNDRESSING MEANWHILE AND SURVEYING THE APARTMENT CASSY MISSUS MORGESON IS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER YES I SAID HUSKILY FOR THE DRY BISCUIT CHOKED ME WHAT WOULD TEMPERANCE AND HEPSEY SAY TO THIS
6272-70171-0019 I THINK THEY WOULD GRUMBLE AND ADMIRE LOOK AT THIS SHOWING HER THE TASSELS OF THE INNER WINDOW CURTAINS DONE UP IN LITTLE BAGS AND THE GLASS IS PINNED UP WITH NICE YELLOW PAPER
6272-70171-0020 AND HERE IS A DAMASK NAPKIN FASTENED TO THE WALL BEHIND THE WASHSTAND AND EVERYTHING STANDS ON A MAT I WONDER IF THIS IS TO BE MY ROOM IT IS PROBABLY THE CHAMBER FOR VISITORS WHY
6272-70171-0021 IT WAS BYRON AND TURNING OVER THE LEAVES TILL I CAME TO DON JUAN I READ IT THROUGH
6272-70171-0022 WHICH WAS NOT THE ONE WE HAD TAKEN TEA IN BUT A SMALL APARTMENT WITH A DOOR OPENING INTO THE GARDEN
6272-70171-0023 AND THEIR MOTHER WAS TENDING AND WATCHING THEM THE OLDEST WAS EIGHT YEARS THE YOUNGEST THREE MONTHS COUSIN ALICE GAVE US DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR TASTES AND HABITS DWELLING WITH EMPHASIS ON THOSE OF THE BABY
6272-70171-0024 I DREW FROM HER CONVERSATION THE OPINION THAT SHE HAD A TENDENCY TO THE REARING OF CHILDREN I WAS GLAD WHEN COUSIN CHARLES CAME IN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH SEND OFF THE BABIES ALICE AND RING THE BELL FOR BREAKFAST SHE SENT OUT THE TWO YOUNGEST
6272-70171-0025 PUT LITTLE EDWARD IN HIS CHAIR AND BREAKFAST BEGAN MISSUS MORGESON SAID CHARLES THE HORSES WILL BE READY TO TAKE YOU ROUND ROSVILLE WE WILL CALL ON DOCTOR PRICE FOR YOU TO SEE THE KIND OF MASTER CASSANDRA WILL HAVE I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT RECEIVING A NEW PUPIL
6272-70171-0026 I SAID MOTHER TRIED IN VAIN TO LOOK HARD HEARTED AND TO PERSUADE THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR ME BUT SHE LOST HER APPETITE WITH THE THOUGHT OF LOSING ME WHICH THE MENTION OF DOCTOR PRICE BROUGHT HOME
6272-70171-0027 THE HAM WAS MOST SAVORY BUT CUT IN SUCH THIN SLICES THAT IT CURLED AND THE BISCUITS WERE AS WHITE AND FEATHERY AS SNOWFLAKES
6272-70171-0028 COUSIN ALICE GAVE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO EDWARD WHO ATE AS LITTLE AS THE REST MOTHER I SAID AFTERWARD
6272-70171-0029 I NOTICED HOW ELEGANT THEIR TABLE APPOINTMENTS WERE AND I SHALL BUY NEW CHINA IN BOSTON TO MORROW I WISH HEPSEY WOULD NOT LOAD OUR TABLE AS SHE DOES HEPSEY IS A GOOD WOMAN MOTHER DO GIVE MY LOVE TO HER NOW THAT I THINK OF IT
6272-70171-0030 SHE WAS ALWAYS MAKING UP SOME NICE DISH TELL HER I REMEMBER IT WILL YOU WHEN COUSIN CHARLES PUT US INTO THE CARRIAGE AND HOISTED LITTLE EDWARD ON THE FRONT SEAT MOTHER NOTICED THAT TWO MEN HELD THE HORSES AND THAT THEY WERE NOT THE SAME HE HAD DRIVEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
6272-70171-0031 SHE SAID SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO THEY LOOKED UNGOVERNABLE BUT HE REASSURED HER AND ONE OF THE MEN AVERRING THAT MISTER MORGESON COULD DRIVE ANYTHING SHE REPRESSED HER FEARS AND WE DROVE OUT OF THE YARD BEHIND A PAIR OF HORSES
6272-70171-0032 THAT STOOD ON THEIR HIND LEGS AS OFTEN AS THAT POSITION WAS COMPATIBLE WITH THE NECESSITY THEY WERE UNDER OF GETTING ON FOR THEY EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY WERE GUIDED BY A FIRM HAND EDWARD WAS DELIGHTED WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR
6272-70171-0033 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIS FATHER SMILE ON HIM THESE ARE FINE BRUTES HE SAID NOT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THEM BUT THEY ARE NOT EQUAL TO MY MARE NELL ALICE IS AFRAID OF HER BUT I HOPE THAT YOU CASSANDRA
6272-70171-0034 LEAPING SO HIGH THAT THE HARNESS SEEMED RATTLING FROM THEIR BACKS HE STRUCK THEM AND SAID GO ON NOW GO ON DEVILS THERE WAS NO FURTHER TROUBLE HE ENCOURAGED MOTHER NOT TO BE AFRAID LOOKING KEENLY AT ME
6272-70171-0035 AND THE SCHOLARS SOME SIXTY BOYS AND GIRLS WERE COMING DOWNSTAIRS FROM THE HALL TO GO INTO THE ROOMS EACH SIDE OF A GREAT DOOR DOCTOR PRICE WAS BEHIND THEM HE STOPPED WHEN HE SAW US AN INTRODUCTION TOOK PLACE AND HE INQUIRED FOR DOCTOR SNELL
6272-70171-0036 AS AN OLD COLLEGE FRIEND LOCKE MORGESON SOUNDED FAMILIARLY HE SAID A MEMBER OF HIS MOTHER'S FAMILY NAMED SOMERS HAD MARRIED A GENTLEMAN OF THAT NAME HE REMEMBERED IT FROM AN OLD IVORY MINIATURE WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SHOWN HIM
6272-70171-0037 TELLING HIM IT WAS THE LIKENESS OF HER COUSIN RACHEL'S HUSBAND I REPLIED WE KNEW THAT GRANDFATHER HAD MARRIED A RACHEL SOMERS COUSIN CHARLES WAS SURPRISED AND A LITTLE VEXED THAT THE DOCTOR HAD NEVER TOLD HIM
6272-70171-0038 AND WE FOLLOWED HIM TO HER SCHOOL ROOM I WAS AT ONCE INTERESTED AND IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF MY TEACHER THAT WAS TO BE SHE WAS A DIGNIFIED KIND LOOKING WOMAN WHO ASKED ME A FEW QUESTIONS IN SUCH A PLEASANT DIRECT MANNER
6272-70171-0039 THAT I FRANKLY TOLD HER I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD VERY IGNORANT AND AVERSE FROM LEARNING BUT I DID NOT SPEAK LOUD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY BESIDE HERSELF TO HEAR NOW SAID MOTHER WHEN WE CAME AWAY
6272-70171-0040 THINK HOW MUCH GREATER YOUR ADVANTAGES ARE THAN MINE HAVE EVER BEEN HOW MISERABLE WAS MY YOUTH IT IS TOO LATE FOR ME TO MAKE ANY ATTEMPT AT CULTIVATION I HAVE NO WISH THAT WAY
6272-70171-0041 AND THAT THERE WAS NO CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH IN ROSVILLE SHE WENT TO BOSTON THAT FRIDAY AFTERNOON ANXIOUS TO GET SAFELY HOME WITH VERONICA WE PARTED WITH MANY A KISS AND SHAKE OF THE HAND AND LAST WORDS
6272-70191-0000 WE SAT IN STATE TO BE CONDOLED WITH AND WAITED UPON
6272-70191-0001 THOUGH I AM SURE THE PERFORMERS THEREOF HAD SMALL ENCOURAGEMENT VERONICA ALONE WOULD SEE NO ONE HER ROOM WAS THE ONLY ONE NOT INVADED FOR THE NEIGHBORS TOOK THE HOUSE INTO THEIR HANDS ASSISTED BY THAT PART OF THE MORGESONS
6272-70191-0002 WHO WERE TOO DISTANTLY RELATED TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES AS MOURNERS TO BE SHUT UP WITH US IT WAS PUT UNDER RIGOROUS FUNERAL LAW AND INSPECTED FROM GARRET TO CELLAR THEY SUPERVISED ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
6272-70191-0003 HER COURSE WAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED MINE WAS IMPOSED UPON ME I REMONSTRATED WITH TEMPERANCE BUT SHE REPLIED THAT IT WAS ALL WELL MEANT AND ALWAYS DONE
6272-70191-0004 I ENDURED THE SAME ANNOYANCES OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM RELAYS OF PEOPLE BED TIME ESPECIALLY WAS THEIR OCCASION I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO UNDRESS ALONE I MUST HAVE DRINKS EITHER TO COMPOSE OR STIMULATE
6272-70191-0005 THEY REITERATED THE CHARACTER THE PECULIARITIES THE VIRTUES OF THE MOTHER I HAD LOST WHO COULD NEVER BE REPLACED WHO WAS IN A BETTER WORLD HOWEVER I WAS IN A MEASURE
6272-70191-0006 KEPT FROM MYSELF DURING THIS INTERVAL THE MATTER IS OFTEN SUBSERVIENT TO THE MANNER ARTHUR'S FEELINGS WERE PLAYED UPON ALSO HE WEPT OFTEN CONFIDING TO ME HIS GRIEF AND HIS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
6272-70191-0007 THINGS WOULD GO WELL HE SAID FOR EVERYBODY MUST EXPECT TO DIE THEN THE BIBLE SAYS SO HE INFORMED ME ALSO THAT HE EXPECTED TO BE AN ARCHITECT AND THAT MOTHER LIKED IT HE HAD AN IDEA
6272-70191-0008 WHICH HE HAD IMPARTED TO HER OF AN ARCH IT MUST BE MADE OF BLACK MARBLE WITH GOLD VEINS AND OUGHT TO STAND IN EGYPT WITH THE WORD PANDEMONIUM ON IT THE KITCHEN WAS THE FOCUS OF INTEREST TO HIM
6272-70191-0009 FOR MEALS WERE PREPARED AT ALL HOURS FOR COMERS AND GOERS TEMPERANCE TOLD ME THAT THE MILD AND INDIFFERENT MOURNERS WERE FOND OF GOOD VICTUALS AND SHE THOUGHT THEIR HEARTS WERE LIGHTER THAN THEIR STOMACHS WHEN THEY WENT AWAY
6272-70191-0010 BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO GRIEF STRUCK AUNT MERCE WAS ENGAGED WITH A DRESSMAKER AND WITH THE ORDERS FOR BONNETS AND VEILS SHE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF THE MOURNING WITH THE MORGESONS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL HER ARRANGEMENTS
6272-70191-0011 FOR SHE DERIVED A SIMPLE COMFORT FROM THESE EXTERNAL TOKENS VERONICA REFUSED TO WEAR THE BONNET AND VEIL AND THE REQUIRED BOMBAZINE BOMBAZINE MADE HER FLESH CRAWL WHY SHOULD SHE WEAR IT MOTHER HATED IT TOO
6272-70191-0012 FOR SHE HAD NEVER WORN OUT THE GARMENTS MADE FOR GRAND'THER WARREN SHE'S A BIGGER CHILD THAN EVER TEMPERANCE REMARKED AND MUST HAVE HER WAY
6272-70191-0013 COMING INTO MY ROOM DRESSED FOR THE FUNERAL NO
6272-70191-0014 THE YARD IS FULL OF CARRIAGES ALREADY SOMEBODY HANDED ME GLOVES MY BONNET WAS TIED A HANDKERCHIEF GIVEN TO ME AND THE DOOR OPENED IN THE PASSAGE I HEARD A KNOCKING FROM VERONICA'S ROOM AND CROSSED TO LEARN WHAT SHE WANTED
6272-70191-0015 IS THIS LIKE HER SHE ASKED SHOWING ME A DRAWING HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE I HAVE TRIED IS IT LIKE YES THE IDEA
6272-70191-0016 BUT WHAT A PICTURE SHE HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE MOTHER'S SHADOWY FACE SERENELY LOOKED FROM A HIGH SMALL WINDOW SET IN CLOUDS LIKE THOSE WHICH GATHER OVER THE SUN WHEN IT DRAWS WATER
6272-70191-0017 IT WAS CLOSELY PRESSED TO THE GLASS AND SHE WAS REGARDING DARK INDEFINITE CREATURES BELOW IT
6272-70191-0018 KEEP IT BUT DON'T WORK ON IT ANY MORE AND I PUT IT AWAY SHE WAS WAN AND LANGUID BUT COLLECTED I SEE YOU ARE READY SOMEBODY MUST BURY THE DEAD GO
6272-70191-0019 WILL THE HOUSE BE EMPTY YES GOOD I CAN WALK THROUGH IT ONCE MORE THE DEAD MUST BE BURIED THAT IS CERTAIN BUT WHY SHOULD IT BE CERTAIN THAT I MUST BE THE ONE TO DO IT YOU THINK I CAN GO THROUGH WITH IT THEN
6272-70191-0020 I HAVE SET YOUR BEHAVIOR DOWN TO YOUR WILL YOU MAY BE RIGHT PERHAPS MOTHER WAS ALWAYS RIGHT ABOUT ME TOO SHE WAS AGAINST ME SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A TIMIDITY AND APPREHENSION THAT MADE MY HEART BLEED
6272-70191-0021 I THINK WE MIGHT KISS EACH OTHER NOW SHE SAID I OPENED MY ARMS HOLDING HER AGAINST MY BREAST SO TIGHTLY THAT SHE DREW BACK BUT KISSED MY CHEEK GENTLY AND TOOK FROM HER POCKET
6272-70191-0022 A FLACON OF SALTS WHICH SHE FASTENED TO MY BELT BY ITS LITTLE CHAIN AND SAID AGAIN GO BUT RECALLING ME SAID
6272-70191-0023 THE LANDING STAIR WAS FULL OF PEOPLE I LOCKED THE DOOR AND TOOK OUT THE KEY THE STAIRS WERE CROWDED ALL MADE WAY FOR ME WITH A SILENT RESPECT AUNT MERCE WHEN SHE SAW ME
6272-70191-0024 PUT HER HAND ON AN EMPTY CHAIR BESIDE FATHER WHO SAT BY THE COFFIN THOSE PASSAGES IN THE BIBLE WHICH CONTAIN THE BEAUTIFULLY POETIC IMAGES RELATING TO THE GOING OF MAN TO HIS LONG HOME WERE READ AND TO MY EAR
6272-70191-0025 THEY SEEMED TO FALL ON THE COFFIN IN DULL STRIFE WITH ITS INMATE WHO MUTELY CONTRADICTED THEM A DISCOURSE FOLLOWED WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO HARROW THE FEELINGS TO THE UTMOST ARTHUR BEGAN TO CRY SO NERVOUSLY
6272-70191-0026 THAT SOME CONSIDERATE FRIEND TOOK HIM OUT AND AUNT MERCE WEPT SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE GREW FAINT AND CAUGHT HOLD OF ME I GAVE HER THE FLACON OF SALTS WHICH REVIVED HER BUT I FELT AS FATHER LOOKED STERN
6272-70191-0027 AND ANXIOUS TO ESCAPE THE UNPROFITABLE TRIAL AS THE COFFIN WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE HEARSE MY HEART TWISTED AND PALPITATED AS IF A COMMAND HAD BEEN LAID UPON IT TO FOLLOW AND NOT LEAVE HER
6272-70191-0028 WHEN THE HEARSE MOVED DOWN THE STREET FATHER ARTHUR AND I WERE CALLED AND ASSISTED IN OUR OWN CHAISE AS IF WE WERE HELPLESS THE REINS WERE PUT IN FATHER'S HANDS AND THE HORSE WAS LED BEHIND THE HEARSE
6272-70191-0029 AT LAST THE WORD WAS GIVEN AND THE LONG PROCESSION BEGAN TO MOVE THROUGH THE STREET WHICH WAS DESERTED A CAT RAN OUT OF A HOUSE AND SCAMPERED ACROSS THE WAY ARTHUR LAUGHED AND FATHER JUMPED NERVOUSLY AT THE SOUND OF HIS LAUGH
6272-70191-0030 THE GRAVEYARD WAS A MILE OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE A SANDY PLAIN WHERE A FEW STUNTED PINES TRANSPLANTED FROM THE WOODS NEAR IT STRUGGLED TO KEEP ALIVE AS WE TURNED FROM THE STREET INTO THE LANE WHICH LED TO IT
6272-70191-0031 AND RODE UP A LITTLE HILL WHERE THE SAND WAS SO DEEP THAT IT MUFFLED THE WHEELS AND FEET OF THE HORSES THE WHOLE ROUND OF THE GRAY SKY WAS VISIBLE IT HUNG LOW OVER US I WISHED IT TO DROP AND BLOT OUT THE VAGUE NOTHINGS UNDER IT
6272-70191-0032 WE LEFT THE CARRIAGE AT THE PALINGS AND WALKED UP THE NARROW PATH AMONG THE MOUNDS WHERE EVERY STONE WAS MARKED MORGESON SOME SO OLD THAT THEY WERE STAINED WITH BLOTCHES OF YELLOW MOSS
6272-70191-0033 SLANTING BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN PROTEST AGAINST THE FOLLY OF INDICATING WHAT WAS NO LONGER BENEATH THEM THE MOUNDS WERE COVERED WITH MATS OF SCANTY TANGLED GRASS WITH HERE AND THERE A RANK SPOT OF GREEN
6272-70191-0034 IT WAS THE CUSTOM AND FATHER TOOK HIS HAT OFF TO THANK HIS FRIENDS FOR THEIR SYMPATHY AND ATTENTION HIS LIPS MOVED BUT NO WORDS WERE AUDIBLE THE PROCESSION MOVED DOWN THE PATH AGAIN
6272-70191-0035 ARTHUR'S HAND WAS IN MINE HE STAMPED HIS FEET FIRMLY ON THE SAND AS IF TO BREAK THE OPPRESSIVE SILENCE WHICH NO ONE SEEMED DISPOSED TO DISTURB THE SAME CEREMONIES WERE PERFORMED IN STARTING US HOMEWARD
6272-70191-0036 BUT NOT A SOUL WAS THERE WHEN WE WENT IN THE DUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND TRADITION HAD BEEN FULFILLED THE NEIGHBORS HAD GONE HOME TO THEIR AVOCATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC THE TRAGEDY WAS OVER ALL SPECULATION ON THE DEGREE OF OUR GRIEF
6272-70191-0037 OR OUR INDIFFERENCE WAS SETTLED WE COULD TAKE OFF OUR MOURNING GARMENTS AND OUR MOURNING COUNTENANCE NOW THAT WE WERE ALONE OR WE COULD GIVE WAY TO THAT ANGUISH WE ARE AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO SHOW EXCEPT BEFORE THE ONE
