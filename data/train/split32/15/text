4137-11701-0045 WAS IT FAIR TO DISAPPOINT ONE WHO HAD PERHAPS SOME LITTLE GROUNDS FOR AFTER ALL HE HAD BEEN NO MORE GALLANT THAN WAS CUSTOMARY FROM A PRINCE AND A GENTLEMAN TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IT WAS HER OWN FAULT IF SHE HAD MISTAKEN HIS INTENTIONS
4137-11701-0046 OF COURSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE LEFT EURALIA LONG AGO BUT HE HAD STAYED ON AND WELL DECIDEDLY SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL PERHAPS HE HAD PAID RATHER TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT AND HE HAD CERTAINLY NEGLECTED THE PRINCESS A LITTLE

4137-11702-0007 POOR LITTLE HYACINTH LEFT ALL ALONE BUT THERE SHE HAD HAD THE COUNTESS BELVANE A WOMAN OF GREAT EXPERIENCE TO HELP HER BELVANE SHOULD HE RISK IT HOW MUCH HAD SHE THOUGHT OF HIM WHILE HE WAS AWAY
4137-11702-0008 HYACINTH WOULD BE GROWING UP AND GETTING MARRIED SOON LIFE WOULD BE LONELY IN EURALIA THEN UNLESS SHOULD HE RISK IT
