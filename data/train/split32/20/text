6078-54007-0009 SO SAYS SAINT NICHOLAS THAT'S A PIECE OF WORK WELL DONE THEN HE TOSSED THE HAZEL NUT UNDER THE ROOTS OF AN OAK TREE NEAR BY AND WENT HIS WAY AND THAT IS HOW THIS STORY BEGINS WELL

6078-54007-0013 THEN AWAY HE FLEW TO ATTEND TO OTHER MATTERS OF GREATER NEED WHEN THE FIDDLER HAD GATHERED HIS WITS TOGETHER AND HIMSELF TO HIS FEET HE SAW THAT HE LAY IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT TREES AND MARBLE WALKS AND WHAT NOT
6078-54007-0014 ALL BUILT OF WHITE MARBLE WITH A FOUNTAIN IN FRONT AND PEACOCKS STRUTTING ABOUT ON THE LAWN WELL THE FIDDLER SMOOTHED DOWN HIS HAIR AND BRUSHED HIS CLOTHES A BIT AND OFF HE WENT TO SEE WHAT WAS TO BE SEEN AT THE GRAND HOUSE AT THE END OF THE GARDEN
6078-54007-0015 HE ENTERED THE DOOR AND NOBODY SAID NO TO HIM THEN HE PASSED THROUGH ONE ROOM AFTER ANOTHER AND EACH WAS FINER THAN THE ONE HE LEFT BEHIND MANY SERVANTS STOOD AROUND BUT THEY ONLY BOWED AND NEVER ASKED WHENCE HE CAME
6078-54007-0016 THE TABLE WAS SPREAD WITH A FEAST THAT SMELLED SO GOOD THAT IT BROUGHT TEARS TO THE FIDDLER'S EYES AND WATER TO HIS MOUTH AND ALL THE PLATES WERE OF PURE GOLD THE LITTLE OLD MAN SAT ALONE BUT ANOTHER PLACE WAS SPREAD
6078-54007-0017 DO NOT SAY THAT SIT DOWN TO THE TABLE AND EAT AND WHEN I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL YOU WILL SAY IT WAS NOT ILL LUCK BUT GOOD LUCK THAT BROUGHT YOU THE FIDDLER HAD HIS OWN MIND ABOUT THAT BUT ALL THE SAME DOWN HE SAT AT THE TABLE
6078-54007-0018 AND FELL TO WITH KNIFE AND FORK AT THE GOOD THINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT HAD A BITE TO EAT FOR A WEEK OF SUNDAYS I AM THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD SAYS THE LITTLE OLD MAN AFTER A WHILE I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAYS THE FIDDLER YOU MAY WELL BE SAID THE OLD MAN
6078-54007-0019 AND WITHOUT WIFE OR CHILD AND THIS MORNING I SAID TO MYSELF THAT THE FIRST BODY THAT CAME TO MY HOUSE I WOULD TAKE FOR A SON OR A DAUGHTER AS THE CASE MIGHT BE YOU ARE THE FIRST
6078-54007-0020 AND SO YOU SHALL LIVE WITH ME AS LONG AS I LIVE AND AFTER I AM GONE EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE SHALL BE YOURS THE FIDDLER DID NOTHING BUT STARE WITH OPEN EYES AND MOUTH AS THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER SHUT EITHER AGAIN
6078-54007-0021 EVERYTHING THE FIDDLER WANTED CAME TO HIS HAND HE LIVED HIGH AND SLEPT SOFT AND WARM AND NEVER KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO WANT EITHER MORE OR LESS OR GREAT OR SMALL IN ALL OF THOSE THREE OR FOUR DAYS HE DID NOTHING BUT ENJOY HIMSELF
6078-54007-0022 WITH MIGHT AND MAIN BUT BY AND BY HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHERE ALL THE GOOD THINGS CAME FROM THEN BEFORE LONG HE FELL TO PESTERING THE OLD MAN WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MATTER AT FIRST THE OLD MAN PUT HIM OFF WITH SHORT ANSWERS
6078-54007-0023 BUT THE FIDDLER WAS A MASTER HAND AT FINDING OUT ANYTHING HE WANTED TO KNOW HE DINNED AND DRUMMED AND WORRIED UNTIL FLESH AND BLOOD COULD STAND IT NO LONGER SO AT LAST THE OLD MAN SAID THAT HE WOULD SHOW HIM THE TREASURE HOUSE WHERE ALL HIS WEALTH CAME FROM
6078-54007-0024 AND AT THAT THE FIDDLER WAS TICKLED BEYOND MEASURE
6078-54007-0025 THERE IN A CORNER BY THE WALL WAS A GREAT TRAP DOOR OF IRON THE OLD MAN FITTED THE KEY TO THE LOCK AND TURNED IT HE LIFTED THE DOOR AND THEN WENT DOWN A STEEP FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AND THE FIDDLER FOLLOWED CLOSE AT HIS HEELS
6078-54007-0026 DOWN BELOW IT WAS AS LIGHT AS DAY FOR IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HUNG A GREAT LAMP THAT SHONE WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT
6078-54007-0027 YOU MUST NEVER OPEN THAT DOOR YONDER AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM SHOULD YOU DO SO ILL LUCK WILL BE SURE TO OVERTAKE YOU OH NO THE FIDDLER WOULD NEVER THINK OF DOING SUCH A THING AS OPENING THE DOOR
6078-54007-0028 AND OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT AGAIN IT TOOK HIM MAYBE AN HOUR TO COUNT ALL THE MONEY AND JEWELS HE HAD BROUGHT UP WITH HIM AFTER HE HAD DONE THAT HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT WAS INSIDE OF THE LITTLE DOOR AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM FIRST HE WONDERED
6078-54007-0029 PERHAPS I CAN SEE WHAT IS THERE WITHOUT OPENING THE DOOR SO DOWN HE TOOK THE KEY AND OFF HE MARCHED TO THE GARDEN HE OPENED THE TRAP DOOR AND WENT DOWN THE STEEP STEPS TO THE ROOM BELOW THERE WAS THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE ROOM
6078-54007-0030 BUT WHEN HE CAME TO LOOK THERE WAS NO KEY HOLE TO IT
6078-54007-0031 HE HEARD A SOUND LIKE THE WAVES BEATING ON THE SHORE WELL SAYS HE THIS IS THE MOST CURIOUS THING I HAVE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE COME SO FAR I MAY AS WELL SEE THE END OF IT
6078-54007-0032 SO HE ENTERED THE PASSAGEWAY AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HE WENT ON AND ON AND THE SPARK OF LIGHT KEPT GROWING LARGER AND LARGER AND BY AND BY POP OUT HE CAME AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGE SURE ENOUGH
6078-54007-0033 THERE HE STOOD ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE WAVES BEATING AND DASHING ON THE ROCKS HE STOOD LOOKING AND WONDERING TO FIND HIMSELF IN SUCH A PLACE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING CAME WITH A WHIZ AND A RUSH AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE BELT AND AWAY HE FLEW LIKE A BULLET
6078-54007-0034 BY AND BY HE MANAGED TO SCREW HIS HEAD AROUND AND LOOK UP AND THERE IT WAS ILL LUCK THAT HAD HIM I THOUGHT SO SAID THE FIDDLER AND THEN HE GAVE OVER KICKING WELL ON AND ON THEY FLEW OVER HILL AND VALLEY OVER MOOR AND MOUNTAIN
6078-54007-0035 UNTIL THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GARDEN AND THERE ILL LUCK LET THE FIDDLER DROP SWASH DOWN HE FELL INTO THE TOP OF AN APPLE TREE AND THERE HE HUNG IN THE BRANCHES IT WAS THE GARDEN OF A ROYAL CASTLE
6078-54007-0036 AND ALL HAD BEEN WEEPING AND WOE THOUGH THEY WERE BEGINNING NOW TO PICK UP THEIR SMILES AGAIN AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY THE KING OF THAT COUNTRY HAD DIED AND NO ONE WAS LEFT BEHIND HIM BUT THE QUEEN
6078-54007-0037 AND SO SHE HAD COME OUT INTO THE GARDEN FOR A BIT OF REST AND THERE SHE SAT UNDER THE SHADE OF AN APPLE TREE FANNING HERSELF AND CRYING WHEN SWASH DOWN FELL THE FIDDLER INTO THE APPLE TREE AND DOWN FELL A DOZEN APPLES
6078-54007-0038 YOU FELL FROM HEAVEN FOR I SAW IT WITH MY EYES AND HEARD IT WITH MY EARS I SEE HOW IT IS NOW YOU WERE SENT HITHER FROM HEAVEN TO BE MY HUSBAND AND MY HUSBAND YOU SHALL BE YOU SHALL BE KING OF THIS COUNTRY HALF AND HALF WITH ME AS QUEEN
6078-54007-0039 AND SHALL SIT ON A THRONE BESIDE ME YOU CAN GUESS WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS MUSIC TO THE FIDDLER'S EARS SO THE PRINCES WERE SENT PACKING AND THE FIDDLER WAS MARRIED TO THE QUEEN AND REIGNED IN THAT COUNTRY WELL THREE OR FOUR DAYS PASSED
6078-54007-0040 AND ALL WAS AS SWEET AND HAPPY AS A SPRING DAY BUT AT THE END OF THAT TIME THE FIDDLER BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT WAS TO BE SEEN IN THE CASTLE THE QUEEN WAS VERY FOND OF HIM AND WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO SHOW HIM ALL THE FINE THINGS THAT WERE TO BE SEEN
6078-54007-0041 YOU MUST NOT ASK OR WISH TO KNOW SHOULD YOU OPEN THAT DOOR ILL LUCK WILL BE SURE TO OVERTAKE YOU POOH SAID THE FIDDLER I DON'T CARE TO KNOW ANYHOW AND OFF THEY WENT HAND IN HAND YES
6078-54007-0042 THAT WAS A VERY FINE THING TO SAY BUT BEFORE AN HOUR HAD GONE BY THE FIDDLER'S HEAD BEGAN TO HUM AND BUZZ LIKE A BEEHIVE I DON'T BELIEVE SAID HE THERE WOULD BE A GRAIN OF HARM IN MY PEEPING INSIDE THAT DOOR ALL THE SAME
6078-54007-0043 WHY LOOK SAYS HE IT IS JUST LIKE THE DOOR AT THE RICH MAN'S HOUSE OVER YONDER I WONDER IF IT IS THE SAME INSIDE AS OUTSIDE AND HE OPENED THE DOOR AND PEEPED IN YES THERE WAS THE LONG PASSAGE
6078-54007-0044 AND THE SPARK OF LIGHT AT THE FAR END AS THOUGH THE SUN WERE SHINING HE COCKED HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AND LISTENED YES SAID HE I THINK I HEAR THE WATER RUSHING BUT I AM NOT SURE I WILL JUST GO A LITTLE FURTHER IN
6078-54007-0045 AND LISTEN AND SO HE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WELL HE WENT ON AND ON UNTIL POP THERE HE WAS OUT AT THE FARTHER END AND BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HE HAD STEPPED OUT UPON THE SEA SHORE
6078-54007-0046 AWAY FLEW THE FIDDLER LIKE A BULLET AND THERE WAS ILL LUCK CARRYING HIM BY THE BELT AGAIN AWAY THEY SPED
6078-54007-0047 UNTIL THE FIDDLER'S HEAD GREW SO DIZZY THAT HE HAD TO SHUT HIS EYES SUDDENLY ILL LUCK LET HIM DROP AND DOWN HE FELL THUMP BUMP ON THE HARD GROUND THEN HE OPENED HIS EYES AND SAT UP
6078-54007-0048 OR ELSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN A KING IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR ILL LUCK AND THAT IS THE WAY WE ALL OF US TALK DOCTOR FAUSTUS HAD SAT ALL THE WHILE NEITHER DRINKING ALE NOR SMOKING TOBACCO BUT WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED AND IN SILENCE
6078-54007-0049 I KNOW NOT WHY IT IS SAID HE BUT THAT STORY OF YOURS MY FRIEND BRINGS TO MY MIND A STORY OF A MAN WHOM I ONCE KNEW A GREAT MAGICIAN IN HIS TIME AND A NECROMANCER AND A CHEMIST AND AN ALCHEMIST
6078-54007-0050 AND A RHETORICIAN AN ASTRONOMER AN ASTROLOGER AND A PHILOSOPHER AS WELL TIS A LONG LIST OF EXCELLENCY SAID OLD BIDPAI
6078-54007-0051 NAY SAID SAINT GEORGE EVERYTHING MUST HAVE A NAME IT HATH NO NAME SAID DOCTOR FAUSTUS BUT I SHALL GIVE IT A NAME AND IT SHALL BE
6078-54013-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A SERVANT WHO SERVED A WISE MAN
6078-54013-0001 DAY AFTER DAY TIME IN AND TIME OUT FOR SEVEN YEARS IN THOSE YEARS THE SERVANT WAS WELL ENOUGH CONTENTED BUT NO ONE LIKES TO ABIDE IN THE SAME PLACE FOREVER AND SO ONE DAY HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
6078-54013-0002 TO SEE WHAT KIND OF A FORTUNE A MAN MIGHT MAKE THERE FOR HIMSELF
6078-54013-0003 YOU HAVE SERVED ME FAITHFULLY THESE SEVEN YEARS GONE AND NOW THAT YOU ASK LEAVE TO GO YOU SHALL GO BUT IT IS LITTLE OR NOTHING IN THE WAY OF MONEY THAT I CAN GIVE YOU AND SO YOU WILL HAVE TO BE CONTENT WITH WHAT I CAN AFFORD
6078-54013-0004 SEE HERE IS A LITTLE PEBBLE AND ITS LIKE IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS FOR WHOEVER HOLDS IT IN HIS MOUTH CAN HEAR WHILE HE DOES SO
6078-54013-0005 PAYING HIS WAY WITH THE FEW PENNIES HE HAD SAVED IN HIS SEVEN YEARS OF SERVICE BUT FOR ALL OF HIS TRAVELLING NOTHING OF GOOD HAPPENED TO HIM UNTIL ONE MORNING HE CAME TO A LONELY PLACE WHERE THERE STOOD A GALLOWS AND THERE HE SAT HIM DOWN TO REST
6078-54013-0006 AND IT IS JUST IN SUCH AN UNLIKELY PLACE AS THIS THAT A MAN'S BEST CHANCE OF FORTUNE COMES TO HIM SOMETIMES AS THE SERVANT SAT THERE THERE CAME TWO RAVENS FLYING AND LIT UPON THE CROSS BEAM OVERHEAD
6078-54013-0007 THERE THEY BEGAN TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND THE SERVANT POPPED THE PEBBLE INTO HIS MOUTH TO HEAR WHAT THEY MIGHT SAY YONDER IS A TRAVELLER IN THE WORLD SAID THE FIRST RAVEN YES SAID THE SECOND
6078-54013-0008 WHY THUS SAID THE SECOND
6078-54013-0009 AND THERE HE WOULD FIND A MAN SITTING
6078-54013-0010 THAT MAN WOULD LEAD HIM TO THE GARDEN
6078-54013-0011 THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS SAID THE FIRST RAVEN AND OF WHAT USE WOULD THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS BE TO HIM
6078-54013-0012 AND WISH AND WHATEVER ONE ASKS FOR ONE SHALL HAVE YOU MAY GUESS THAT WHEN THE SERVANT UNDERSTOOD THE TALK OF THE RAVENS HE WAS NOT SLOW IN MAKING USE OF WHAT HE HEARD UP HE SCRAMBLED
6078-54013-0013 AND AWAY HE WENT AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM ON AND ON HE TRAVELLED UNTIL HE CAME TO THE CROSS ROADS AND THE STONE CROSS OF WHICH THE RAVEN SPOKE AND THERE SURE ENOUGH SAT THE TRAVELLER
6078-54013-0014 THERE IS ONE CONDITION YOU MUST FULFIL MANY STRANGE THINGS WILL HAPPEN UPON OUR JOURNEY BETWEEN HERE AND THERE
6078-54013-0015 AND SAY NOT A WORD DO YOU AGREE TO THAT YES SAID THE SERVANT I DO VERY WELL SAID HIS NEW COMRADE THEN LET US BE JOGGING
6078-54013-0016 AND THE TIME IS NONE TOO LONG TO GET THERE SO ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY THEY JOURNEYED ONWARD TOGETHER UNTIL TOWARDS EVENING THEY CAME TO A TOWN WITH HIGH TOWERS AND STEEP ROOFS AND TALL SPIRES
6078-54013-0017 THE SERVANT'S COMPANION ENTERED THE GATE AS THOUGH HE KNEW THE PLACE RIGHT WELL AND LED THE WAY UP ONE STREET AND DOWN ANOTHER UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A NOBLE HOUSE THAT STOOD A LITTLE APART BY ITSELF WITH GARDENS OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT TREES ALL AROUND IT
6078-54013-0018 THERE THE TRAVELLING COMPANION STOPPED AND DRAWING OUT A LITTLE PIPE FROM UNDER HIS JACKET
6078-54013-0019 TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC WELL HE PLAYED AND PLAYED UNTIL BY AND BY THE DOOR OPENED AND OUT CAME A SERVING MAN HO PIPER SAID HE
6078-54013-0020 WHERE DOZENS OF SERVANTS WERE SERVING A FINE FEAST BUT ONLY ONE MAN SAT AT TABLE A YOUNG MAN WITH A FACE SO SORROWFUL THAT IT MADE A BODY'S HEART ACHE TO LOOK UPON HIM CAN YOU PLAY GOOD MUSIC PIPER SAID HE
6078-54013-0021 BUT SUDDENLY EVERYTHING WENT WRONG HIS WIFE AND HE FELL OUT AND QUARRELLED UNTIL THERE WAS NO LIVING TOGETHER AND SHE HAD TO GO BACK TO HER OLD HOME THEN HIS COMPANIONS DESERTED HIM AND NOW HE LIVED ALL ALONE YOURS IS A HARD CASE SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION
6078-54013-0022 THEREUPON HE DREW OUT HIS PIPES AND BEGAN TO PLAY AND IT WAS SUCH A TUNE AS NO MAN EVER LISTENED TO BEFORE HE PLAYED AND HE PLAYED AND AFTER A WHILE ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF THOSE WHO LISTENED TO HIM BEGAN TO GET DROWSY FIRST THEY WINKED
6078-54013-0023 THEN THEY SHUT THEIR EYES AND THEN THEY NODDED UNTIL ALL WERE AS DUMB AS LOGS AND AS SOUND ASLEEP AS THOUGH THEY WOULD NEVER WAKEN AGAIN ONLY THE SERVANT AND THE PIPER STAYED AWAKE FOR THE MUSIC DID NOT MAKE THEM DROWSY AS IT DID THE REST
6078-54013-0024 THEN WHEN ALL BUT THEY TWO WERE TIGHT AND FAST ASLEEP
6078-54013-0025 AND STEPPING UP TO THE YOUNG MAN TOOK FROM OFF HIS FINGER A SPLENDID RUBY RING AS RED AS BLOOD AND AS BRIGHT AS FIRE AND POPPED THE SAME INTO HIS POCKET AND ALL THE WHILE THE SERVING MAN STOOD GAPING LIKE A FISH
6078-54013-0026 TO SEE WHAT HIS COMRADE WAS ABOUT
6078-54013-0027 NONE WAS MORE UGLY THAN THIS TO BEWITCH THE POOR SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN INTO A SLEEP AND THEN TO ROB HIM OF HIS RUBY RING
6078-54013-0028 BUT THE NEXT DAY THEY JOGGED ON TOGETHER AGAIN UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A GREAT FOREST THERE THEY WANDERED UP AND DOWN TILL NIGHT CAME UPON THEM AND FOUND THEM STILL STUMBLING ONWARD THROUGH THE DARKNESS
6078-54013-0029 HE SEEMED TO DOUBT NOTHING NOR FEAR NOTHING BUT TRUDGED STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL BY AND BY THEY SAW A LIGHT TWINKLING FAR AWAY AND WHEN THEY CAME TO IT THEY FOUND A GLOOMY STONE HOUSE AS UGLY AS EYES EVER LOOKED UPON
6078-54013-0030 UP STEPPED THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND KNOCKED UPON THE DOOR RAP TAP TAP BY AND BY IT WAS OPENED A CRACK AND THERE STOOD AN UGLY OLD WOMAN BLEAR EYED AND CROOKED AND GNARLED AS A WINTER TWIG
6078-54013-0031 NO MATTER FOR THAT SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION WE CAN GO NO FARTHER TO NIGHT SO YOU MUST LET US IN AND HIDE US AS BEST YOU MAY AND IN HE WENT AS HE SAID WITH THE SERVANT AT HIS HEELS
6078-54013-0032 TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF AT WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE OLD WOMAN GAVE THEM SOME BREAD AND MEAT TO EAT AND THEN HID THEM AWAY IN THE GREAT EMPTY MEAL CHEST IN THE CORNER AND THERE THEY LAY AS STILL AS MICE
6078-54013-0033 BY AND BY IN CAME THE GANG OF THIEVES WITH A GREAT NOISE AND UPROAR AND DOWN THEY SAT TO THEIR SUPPER
6078-54013-0034 HOW THEY HAD CRUELLY ROBBED AND MURDERED POOR PEOPLE
6078-54013-0035 HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET THE RUBY RING WHICH HE HAD STOLEN FROM THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN'S FINGER
6078-54013-0036 THEN HE LED THE WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE AND IF THE SERVING MAN HAD WONDERED THE DAY BEFORE AT THAT WHICH THE COMRADE DID HE WONDERED TEN TIMES MORE TO SEE HIM GIVE SO BEAUTIFUL A RING
6078-54013-0037 THE TWO TRAVELLERS CAME TO A LITTLE HUT NEAT ENOUGH
6078-54013-0038 AND THERE THE COMRADE KNOCKED UPON THE DOOR AND ASKED FOR LODGING
6078-54013-0039 NEVERTHELESS THEY MADE THE TRAVELLERS WELCOME AND SET BEFORE THEM THE VERY BEST THAT WAS TO BE HAD IN THE HOUSE AND AFTER BOTH HAD EATEN AND DRUNK THEY SHOWED THEM TO BED IN A CORNER AS CLEAN AS SNOW AND THERE THEY SLEPT THE NIGHT THROUGH
6078-54013-0040 BUT THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE DAWNING OF THE DAY THE TRAVELLING COMPANION WAS STIRRING AGAIN
6078-54013-0041 FOR I HAVE A BIT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE AND STRANGE WORK IT WAS
6078-54013-0042 HE GATHERED TOGETHER A GREAT HEAP OF STRAW AND STICKS OF WOOD AND STUFFED ALL UNDER THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE THEN HE STRUCK A LIGHT AND SET FIRE TO IT
6078-54013-0043 ALL WAS A RED BLAZE BEHIND THEM
6078-54013-0044 ON THEY JOGGED AND BY THE TIME EVENING WAS AT HAND THEY HAD COME TO A NEAT COTTAGE
6078-54013-0045 IN THIS COTTAGE LIVED A WIDOW AND HER ONLY SON AND THEY ALSO MADE THE TRAVELLERS WELCOME AND SET BEFORE THEM A GOOD SUPPER AND SHOWED THEM TO A CLEAN BED THIS TIME THE TRAVELLING COMRADE DID NEITHER GOOD NOR ILL TO THOSE OF THE HOUSE
6078-54013-0046 BUT IN THE MORNING HE TOLD THE WIDOW WHITHER THEY WERE GOING AND ASKED IF SHE AND HER SON KNEW THE WAY TO THE GARDEN WHERE GREW THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS YES SAID SHE THAT WE DO FOR THE GARDEN IS NOT A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM HERE
6078-54013-0047 AND MY SON HIMSELF SHALL GO WITH YOU TO SHOW YOU THE WAY THAT IS GOOD SAID THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND IF HE WILL DO SO I WILL PAY HIM WELL FOR HIS TROUBLE SO THE YOUNG MAN PUT ON HIS HAT AND TOOK UP HIS STICK
6078-54013-0048 AND OFF WENT THE THREE UP HILL AND DOWN DALE UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME OVER THE TOP OF THE LAST HILL AND THERE BELOW THEM LAY THE GARDEN AND WHAT A SIGHT IT WAS THE LEAVES SHINING AND GLISTENING LIKE SO MANY JEWELS IN THE SUNLIGHT
6078-54013-0049 ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO STAND AND LOOK
6078-54013-0050 TORRENT WITHOUT A BRIDGE FOR A BODY TO CROSS OVER YONDER IS WHAT YOU SEEK SAID THE YOUNG MAN POINTING WITH HIS FINGER AND THERE YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS
6078-54013-0051 BUT SUDDENLY CATCHING THE WIDOW'S SON BY THE COLLAR HE LIFTED HIM AND FLUNG HIM INTO THE BLACK RUSHING WATER SPLASH WENT THE YOUNG MAN AND THEN AWAY HE WENT WHIRLING OVER ROCKS AND WATER FALLS THERE CRIED THE COMRADE
6078-54013-0052 THAT IS YOUR REWARD FOR YOUR SERVICE
6078-54013-0053 HE FOUND HIS TONGUE AT LAST AND ALL THAT HE HAD BOTTLED UP
6078-54013-0054 SUCH ABUSE AS HE SHOWERED UPON HIS TRAVELLING COMPANION NO MAN EVER LISTENED TO BEFORE BUT TO ALL THE SERVANT SAID THE OTHER ANSWERED NEVER A WORD UNTIL HE HAD STOPPED FOR SHEER WANT OF BREATH THEN POOR FOOL SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION
6078-54013-0055 THEREUPON AS HE ENDED SPEAKING HE STRUCK HIS STAFF UPON THE GROUND INSTANTLY THE EARTH TREMBLED AND THE SKY DARKENED OVERHEAD UNTIL IT GREW AS BLACK AS NIGHT
6078-54013-0056 THE GARDEN AND THE TORRENT AND ALL WERE GONE AND NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT A NAKED PLAIN COVERED OVER WITH THE BONES OF THOSE WHO HAD COME THAT WAY BEFORE SEEKING THE FRUIT WHICH THE TRAVELLING SERVANT HAD SOUGHT IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE SERVANT FOUND HIS WAY BACK INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
6078-54013-0057 BUT WHAT A CHANGE HE BEHELD IT WAS A POOR COTTAGE NO LONGER BUT A SPLENDID PALACE FIT FOR A QUEEN TO DWELL IN
6078-54013-0058 AND SHE WAS DRESSED IN CLOTHES FIT FOR A QUEEN TO WEAR SHINING WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES THE SERVANT STOOD AND STARED LIKE ONE BEREFT OF WITS
6078-54013-0059 AN ANGEL CAME AND SHOWED THE WAY TO MY SON
6078-54013-0060 BUT TO BRING AN APPLE FOR ME ALSO THEN THE POOR TRAVELLING SERVANT BEGAN TO THUMP HIS HEAD HE SAW WELL ENOUGH THROUGH THE MILLSTONE NOW AND THAT HE TOO MIGHT HAVE HAD ONE OF THE FRUIT IF HE HAD BUT HELD HIS TONGUE A LITTLE LONGER
6078-54013-0061 THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD SEEN THE ANGEL SET FIRE TO THERE HE BEHELD MASONS AND CARPENTERS HARD AT WORK HACKING AND HEWING AND BUILDING A FINE NEW HOUSE AND THERE HE SAW THE POOR MAN HIMSELF STANDING BY GIVING THEM ORDERS HOW IS THIS SAID THE TRAVELLING SERVANT
6078-54013-0062 FOR MANY A LONG DAY AND NEVER KNEW THAT A GREAT TREASURE OF SILVER AND GOLD WAS HIDDEN BENEATH IT UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO THERE CAME AN ANGEL
6078-54013-0063 THE NEXT MORNING THE POOR SERVANT JOGGED ALONG ON HIS HOMEWARD WAY MORE SAD AND DOWNCAST THAN EVER AND BY EVENING HE HAD COME TO THE ROBBERS DEN IN THE THICK WOODS AND THERE THE OLD WOMAN CAME RUNNING TO THE DOOR TO MEET HIM
6078-54013-0064 HE GAVE IT TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE BAND AND AFTER HE HAD GONE THE ROBBERS FOUGHT FOR IT WITH ONE ANOTHER UNTIL THEY WERE ALL KILLED SO NOW THE WORLD IS RID OF THEM AND TRAVELLERS CAN COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE BACK JOGGED THE TRAVELLING SERVANT
6078-54013-0065 AND THE NEXT DAY CAME TO THE TOWN AND TO THE HOUSE OF THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN THERE LO AND BEHOLD INSTEAD OF BEING DARK AND SILENT AS IT WAS BEFORE ALL WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT AND NOISY WITH THE SOUND OF REJOICING AND MERRIMENT
6078-54013-0066 THERE HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD STANDING AT THE DOOR AND HE KNEW THE SERVANT AS THE COMPANION OF THAT ONE WHO HAD STOLEN THE RUBY RING UP HE CAME AND LAID HOLD OF THE SERVANT BY THE COLLAR CALLING TO HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT ONE OF THE THIEVES
6078-54013-0067 INTO THE HOUSE THEY HAULED THE POOR SERVANT AND INTO THE SAME ROOM WHERE HE HAD BEEN BEFORE AND THERE SAT THE YOUNG MAN AT A GRAND FEAST WITH HIS WIFE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS AROUND HIM BUT WHEN THE YOUNG MAN SAW THE POOR SERVING MAN HE CAME TO HIM
6078-54013-0068 AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND SET HIM BESIDE HIMSELF AT THE TABLE
6078-54013-0069 IT WAS THE RING OF DISCORD THAT BRED STRIFE WHEREVER IT CAME
6078-54013-0070 MY WIFE AND ALL MY FRIENDS FELL OUT WITH ME AND WE QUARRELLED SO THAT THEY ALL LEFT ME BUT THOUGH I KNEW IT NOT AT THAT TIME YOUR COMRADE WAS AN ANGEL AND TOOK THE RING AWAY WITH HIM AND NOW I AM AS HAPPY AS I WAS SORROWFUL BEFORE
