7505-258958-0000 SATISFACTION AND GRATIFICATION BEING ONLY TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ECONOMIC WANTS APPEAR IN MORE OR LESS REGULARLY RECURRING SERIES IMPRESSIONS ARE SHORT LIVED SENSATIONS ARE TEMPORARY
7505-258958-0001 WANTS THAT HAVE BEEN SATISFIED RECUR WANTS RECUR FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THEY FIRST AROSE NO IMPRESSION ON THE NERVES OR ON THE SENSES IS LASTING
7505-258958-0002 THE UTILITY TO THAT PERSON OF THAT THING OR SERVICE FOR THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT FALLS IT MAY BE EVEN TO ZERO TO KEEP WANTS SATISFIED IS IMPOSSIBLE WE CANNOT DO NEXT YEAR'S READING OR NEXT WEEK'S EATING NOW
7505-258958-0003 IN ITS POWER TO GRATIFY WANTS THE CLOSER THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES THAT OF WANTS AND THAT OF GOODS THE GREATER WILL BE THE TOTAL OF GRATIFICATION
7505-258958-0004 OR BY SOCIETY DURING THE INCOME PERIOD THE TERM NATIONAL OR SOCIAL INCOME MAY BE CONTRASTED WITH INDIVIDUAL OR PRIVATE INCOME IN THE OBJECTIVE SENSE
7505-258958-0005 ONLY WHEN GOODS ARE PRODUCED INDIVIDUALS MAY ACQUIRE INCOME BY GIFT BEQUEST THEFT OR OTHER MODES OF TRANSFER FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN MANY CASES THE TWO KINDS OF INCOME HOWEVER AGREE
7505-258958-0006 THE OBJECTIVE INCOME OF SOCIETY BEING THE ALGEBRAIC SUM OF THE GOODS ACQUIRED OR PARTED WITH BY ALL THE INDIVIDUALS WE SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THAT EITHER SOCIAL OR PRIVATE OBJECTIVE INCOMES INCLUDE ONLY MATERIAL GOODS
7505-258958-0007 FOR MANY UTILITIES AND LABOR SERVICES THAT NEVER TAKE ON A MATERIAL OR MONEY EXPRESSION ARE INCLUDED IN EITHER CASE INDEED WE ARE CLOSE HERE TO THE CONCEPTION OF PSYCHIC INCOME
7505-258958-0008 MUST BE A NET ADDITION BUT THE TERM GROSS INCOME IS NOT WITHOUT POPULAR AND PRACTICAL MEANING GROSS INCOME IS SOMETIMES SPOKEN OF IN THE SENSE OF TOTAL RECEIPTS
7505-258958-0009 AS THE TOTAL OF GOODS SECURED NET INCOME IS THE REMAINDER AFTER DEDUCTING EXPENDITURES AND AFTER REPLACING THE GOODS EMPLOYED TO SECURE THE INCOME IN ORDER TO PRODUCE SOME GOODS TECHNICALLY
7505-258958-0010 MEN MAKE USE OF OTHER GOODS WHILE THEY ARE STORING UP A SUPPLY OF WOOD OR COAL IT MAY BE LOOKED UPON AS THE INCOME BUT THEY MAY BURN IT TO HELP GROW HOTHOUSE PLANTS
7505-258958-0011 WHILE THEY GATHER FLOWERS WITH ONE HAND THEY DESTROY FUEL WITH THE OTHER ONLY THE NET INCREASE IN VALUE CAN BE ACCOUNTED INCOME IN THE SECOND PERIOD
7505-258958-0012 THE GOODS THAT COME INTO A MAN'S POSSESSION IN ANY PERIOD ARE OF MANY SORTS TO GET SOME HE HAS DESTROYED MANY PREVIOUSLY EXISTING GOODS
7505-258958-0013 WHILE TO GET OTHERS HE HAS NOT NEEDED TO USE UP THE ACCUMULATIONS OF THE PAST OR TO MORTGAGE THE FUTURE THE ONE KIND IS GROSS THE OTHER NET INCOME
7505-258958-0014 OF A SERIES OF GRATIFICATIONS IS A REGULAR SERIES OF CONSUMPTION GOODS BUT MANY THINGS EXISTING WHICH COULD BE USED TO SECURE A GRATIFICATION ARE NOT IN FACT TREATED AS CONSUMPTION GOODS
7505-258958-0015 A CROP OF CORN IS NOT ALL INCOME IN A TIME OF FAMINE IT COULD BE USED BUT SEED CORN WAS SAVED FROM LAST YEAR
7505-258958-0016 IT IS TRUE THAT EVERYTHING CALLED WEALTH IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE SOONER OR LATER IN SOME WAY TO THE SUM OF GRATIFICATIONS IT IS FOR THAT REASON IT IS CALLED WEALTH IT IS HOWEVER
7505-258958-0017 A MERE FIGURE OF SPEECH TO SAY INDIRECT WANT GRATIFIERS BECOME WANT GRATIFYING GOODS FOR EXAMPLE THE ENGINE TRANSPORTING A LOAD OF COAL IS INDIRECTLY GRATIFYING WANTS
7505-258958-0018 BETWEEN PRESENT AND FUTURE INCOMES THE VALUE OF THE MASS OF WEALTH IN POSSESSION AND YIELDING INCOME RESTS IN LARGE PART UPON ITS POWER OF CONTRIBUTING TO INCOME IN SOME FUTURE PERIOD THUS
7505-258958-0019 SUCH AS LANDS RAILROAD STOCKS GOVERNMENT BONDS ET CETERA THE INCOME IS FUNDED BECAUSE IT CORRESPONDS TO AN ABIDING FUND OF WEALTH THE INCOME ARISING FROM CURRENT LABOR IS UNFUNDED
7505-258958-0020 BECAUSE THERE IS NO PERMANENT FUND OF ACCUMULATED WEALTH CORRESPONDING TO IT THE IDEA OF REGULARITY CONNECTED WITH FUNDED INCOME IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE IDEA OF INCOME IN GENERAL
7505-258958-0021 IF IT IS PART OF THE SUM OF GOODS THAT FLOWS IN THAT IS NEWLY AVAILABLE FOR THE MAN'S USE IT IS INCOME BUT FUNDED INCOME IS THE MORE ABIDING FOR INCOME FROM WAGES STOPS
7505-258958-0022 THE REAL INCOME BUT CERTAINLY IT IS NOT INCOME IN THE MOST ESSENTIAL SENSE THINGS OUTSIDE OF MEN CANNOT BE FEELINGS THEY CAN ONLY CALL OUT OR OCCASION FEELING
7505-258958-0023 AND REDUCIBLE TO PSYCHIC INCOME SOME PORTIONS AT LEAST OF THE OBJECTIVE INCOMES OF GOODS ARE CONTINUALLY BY USE BECOMING SUBJECTIVE INCOMES OF ENJOYMENT
7505-258958-0024 MEN TALK OF MATERIAL INCOME AS CONSISTING OF BUSHELS OF WHEAT HEAD OF CATTLE ET CETERA AND OF IMMATERIAL INCOME AS THE USES THAT DURABLE GOODS YIELD DIRECTLY
7505-258958-0025 OR THAT MEN PERFORM FOR EACH OTHER E G THOSE OF THE SINGER PHYSICIAN TEACHER JUDGE ALL SERVICES THAT DO NOT TAKE ON MATERIAL FORM
7505-258958-0026 THERE WAS A LONG STANDING DISPUTE IN ECONOMIC LITERATURE REGARDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRODUCTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE LABOR PRODUCTIVE LABOR WAS SAID TO BE THAT WHICH EMBODIED ITSELF IN ABIDING MATERIAL FORM
7505-258958-0027 THE DISTINCTION LED TO SOME PECULIAR PUZZLES AND PARADOXES THE BARTENDER MIXING DRINKS ADDS TO THE VALUE OF THOSE INGREDIENTS IN A MINUTE THAT VALUE IS DISSIPATED
7505-258958-0028 ACCORDING TO THE DISTINCTION IN QUESTION HE IS A PRODUCTIVE LABORER BECAUSE HIS SERVICES ARE EMBODIED IN MATERIAL FORM WHEREAS THE LECTURER IS REGARDED AS AN UNPRODUCTIVE LABORER
7505-258958-0029 BUT WHETHER OR NOT THE SERVICE HAS FOR A MOMENT EMBODIED ITSELF IN MATERIAL FORM IS OF NO ESSENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPORT
7505-258958-0030 BUT A SIMILAR DISTINCTION IS INCONSISTENTLY PRESERVED BY MANY WRITERS IN THE CASE OF MATERIAL THINGS A BUILDING USED AS A FACTORY IS CALLED PRODUCTIVE
7505-258958-0031 BUT USED BY THE OWNER AS A DWELLING IT IS CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THE SERVICE IT RENDERS DOES NOT APPEAR IN MATERIAL FORM BUT THE USE OF THE HOUSE OR THAT OF LAND FOR A SCHOOL GROUND OR CAMPUS
7505-258958-0032 AND THUS HIS FELT DEPENDENCE ON GOODS EXTENDS OVER A SERIES OF FUTURE PRODUCTIVE AGENTS IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY THE PROBLEM WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE ECONOMIC MAN AS LIVING ONLY IN AND FOR THE MOMENT
7505-258958-0033 IF HE HAD NO MORE KNOWLEDGE MEMORY OR IMAGINATION THAN IS NECESSARY TO COMPARE GOODS HERE ONLY PRESENT GOODS COULD HAVE VALUE TO HIM EVEN THE HIGHER ANIMALS AND MUCH MORE THE SAVAGES
7505-258958-0034 TO BE USED BY A HUNGRY MAN FOR FOOD FOR A SHEEP TO BE KEPT FOR BREEDING OR FOR WOOL TO BE MADE INTO CLOTH NEXT YEAR HE MAY OVERLOOK THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GRADE OF WANTS COMPARED IN THIS CASE A GRATIFICATION
7505-258958-0035 OF THE PRESENT MOMENT IS COMPARED WITH A GRATIFICATION OF A VERY DIFFERENT KIND AT A FUTURE TIME THE PROBLEM INVOLVED IS COMPLEX BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES IN TIME IN PLACE AND IN THE NATURE OF THE WANT GRATIFIERS
7505-258964-0000 HE MULTIPLIES MANY OTHERS WE HAVE NOTED MANY KINDS OF DEPRECIATION DESTRUCTION AND WEARING OUT OF WEALTH BUT THE NORMAL THING IN A HEALTHY SOCIETY IS AN INCREASE ON THE WHOLE OF RENT BEARERS
7505-258964-0001 THE INCREASE OF RENTS IS DUE TO TWO CAUSES CHANGES IN THE AGENTS BY WHICH THEY BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TECHNICALLY OR MORE NUMEROUS AND CHANGES TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE AGENTS
7505-258964-0002 AFFECTING THE UTILITY OF THE PRODUCTS THE FIRST OF THESE WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THIS SECTION THE INCREASE OF THE EFFICIENCY OF AGENTS IS USUALLY THE AIM OF THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCER
7505-258964-0003 AND THUS IS BROUGHT ABOUT AN INCREASE OF THE STOCK OF WEALTH IN SOME CASES HOWEVER IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS THE DREDGING OF HARBORS OR AS THE PROTECTING OF FORESTS ARE MADE BY MEN COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THE AGENCY OF GOVERNMENTS
7505-258964-0004 SOMEWHERE HOWEVER THE DESIRE FOR THESE CHANGES MUST ARISE IN THE MINDS OF INDIVIDUALS INCREASE OF MOST THINGS INVOLVES COST OR SACRIFICE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE
7505-258964-0005 OTHER TRACTS LESS FERTILE OR FOR SOME REASON LESS AVAILABLE ARE DITCHED TILED AND DIKED AND FERTILIZERS ARE CARRIED UP STEEP HILLSIDES TO MAKE A SOIL UPON THE VERY CRAGS
7505-258964-0006 ENABLING THEM TO CARRY A GREATER AMOUNT OF FREIGHT WITHIN A YEAR
7505-258964-0007 THAT MAKE MACHINES STRONGER QUICKER AND BETTER THIS PROPOSITION IS NOT LOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PRECEDING A MACHINE IS AN ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL THINGS
7505-258964-0008 THROUGH WHICH FORCE MAY BE INDIRECTLY APPLIED TO MOVE MATTER NO FAST LINE DIVIDES MACHINERY AS REGARDS FORM PURPOSE OR CAUSE OF VALUE FROM THE ARTIFICIALLY IMPROVED NATURAL AGENTS
7505-258964-0009 THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING JUST AS A FIELD IS DRAINED PLOWED AND CULTIVATED TO FIT IT BETTER TO YIELD A CROP SO IS THE IRON ORE SHAPED INTO A FORM
7505-258964-0010 IF THE QUALITY OR EFFICIENCY OF LOOMS IS DOUBLED IT IS AS IF THEIR NUMBER HAD GROWN IN LIKE PROPORTION IN ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION THE BEAST OF BURDEN MAY NOT ILLOGICALLY BE CLASSED WITH INANIMATE MACHINES
7505-258964-0011 AND THERE WAS MUCH COMMENT ON THIS EVIDENCE OF A DECLINING INDUSTRY IT WAS NOT AT ONCE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE WAS EMBODIED IN HORSE FLESH MORE HORSE POWER THAN EVER BEFORE
7505-258964-0012 SO AS TO MAKE A MORE EFFICIENT AGENT AND MACHINES IN TURN MAY BE ADJUSTED AS PARTS OF A LARGER SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION THE IDEAL OF THE MODERN FACTORY SYSTEM IS SO TO ARRANGE THE MACHINERY
7505-258964-0013 THAT NO BIT OF MATERIAL WILL MAKE AN UNNECESSARY MOTION THE LOG ONCE STARTED THROUGH THE MILL IS CARRIED AUTOMATICALLY FROM ONE MACHINE TO ANOTHER UNTIL IT EMERGES AS A ROLL OF PAPER
7505-258964-0014 OR AS A BOX OF TOOTH PICKS READY FOR USE IN AN AMERICAN WATCH FACTORY ONE MAN TENDS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN AUTOMATIC MACHINES A SMALL BRASS ROD IS FED AUTOMATICALLY TO THE MACHINE
7505-258964-0015 WHERE IT IS READY FOR THE ASSEMBLING OF THE WATCH AS THE MACHINERY IMPROVES FACTORIES MAKING ALLIED PRODUCTS ARE GROUPED TO MAKE A SYSTEM STILL MORE EFFICIENT AS THE NUMBER OF AGENTS INCREASES
7505-258964-0016 THEY ARE DISTRIBUTED SO AS TO BE WHERE MOST USEFUL TO THE OWNER A MAN HAVING TWO UMBRELLAS KEEPS ONE AT HIS OFFICE AND THE OTHER AT HOME A STUDENT HAVING TWO BOOKS OF THE SAME KIND
7505-258964-0017 WHICH CAPTURE THE NATURAL FORCES OF THE WORLD PUT THEM INTO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MAKE THEM DO THE RIGHT THING OR WHICH GROUP AND RELATE THE MATERIALS OF THE WORLD IN THE RIGHT WAYS
7505-258964-0018 SOME OF THE GROUPINGS IN THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL WORLD THAT DO NOT FIT MAN'S PURPOSES MAY BE MADE TO DO SO
7505-258964-0019 BUT IN DOING THAT HE AFFECTS THE AGENTS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY OTHERS THE IDEAL FROM A SOCIAL STANDPOINT IS TO INCREASE NOT RENT BUT THE WELFARE OF SOCIETY
7505-258964-0020 AND THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE IDEAL OF INDIVIDUALS SEEKING THEIR OWN INTEREST HOWEVER AS THE EFFICIENCY OF SOME AGENTS RISES IT BECOMES UNNECESSARY AND UNPROFITABLE TO USE THE LESS FERTILE FIELDS
7505-258964-0021 THEY CEASE TO BE RENT BEARERS AND THE RENT OF THE RICHER FIELDS FALLS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEW SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS SOME INVENTIONS SUDDENLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF FREE GOODS TO SUCH A DEGREE
7505-258964-0022 THAT THE LESS EFFICIENT RENTED AGENTS ARE THROWN OUT OF USE AND THE MARGIN OF UTILIZATION IS MOVED TO A HIGHER PLANE THAN IT WAS ON BEFORE IMPROVED TYPES OF MACHINERY MORE OR LESS RAPIDLY DISPLACE THE OLDER
7505-258964-0023 LESS EFFICIENT TYPES WHICH THEREFORE MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY LOSE THEIR RENT BEARING POWER LONG BEFORE THEY ARE PHYSICALLY WORN OUT
7505-258964-0024 WHEN IMPROVEMENTS IN AGRICULTURE THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO A CONSIDERABLE AREA OF LAND TAKE PLACE AND THE PRODUCT THUS IS INCREASED AND CHEAPENED THE POORER LAND IS ABANDONED
7505-258964-0025 AGENTS OF THE SAME KIND MAY DIMINISH IN NUMBER EITHER ABSOLUTELY OR RELATIVELY
7505-258964-0026 SUCH A LUCKY FIND HAS LIFTED THE MORTGAGE FROM A FARM IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA FROM WHICH IN TWO OR THREE YEARS HAS BEEN TAKEN FELDSPAR EXCEEDING IN VALUE THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
7505-258964-0027 OF THE SAME LAND IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THE DISCOVERY OF BUILDING STONE COAL NATURAL GAS OR OIL LAND MAY MAKE THE ANNUAL RENT OR ROYALTY
7505-258964-0028 OF LAND TENFOLD ITS FORMER TOTAL VALUE FITNESS TO PRODUCE NETTLES IS NOT ORDINARILY A VIRTUE IN LAND
7505-258964-0029 BUT THE DISCOVERY THAT CERTAIN FIELDS PRODUCE A SUPERIOR QUALITY OF THE NETTLE USED FOR HECKLING CLOTH CAUSES THEM TO TAKE ON A NEW VALUE A MINERAL SPRING BECAUSE OF THE
7505-258964-0030 MAY BE AS GOOD AS A MINE TO THE OWNER PECULIAR FITNESS FOR THE CULTIVATION OF CELERY MAY CONVERT MARSH LAND INTO A SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF INCOME
7505-258964-0031 SOCIAL CHANGES ARE CONSTANTLY CAUSING AGENTS TO SHIFT FROM LOWER TO HIGHER USES AS POPULATION GROWS AND GROUPS ABOUT NEW INDUSTRIES FARM LAND IS USED FOR RESIDENCE LOTS
7505-258964-0032 AND IN TURN FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES RENTS THEREFORE RISE AND THIS RISE IS REFLECTED IN THE HIGHER SELLING VALUE OF THE LAND IF A NEW DEMAND ARISES FOR THE PRODUCT OF ANY MACHINE
7505-258964-0033 ITS RENT RISES ALTHOUGH IT MAY CONTINUE TO TURN OUT THE SAME PRODUCT
7505-258964-0034 MAY BE RELATIVELY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BUSINESS CONDITIONS SOMETIMES CHANGE QUICKLY AN URGENT DEMAND FOR SPECIAL MACHINERY RAISES QUICKLY ITS RENT AND VALUE
7505-258964-0035 IT IS SAID THAT LACE MACHINERY IS SOMETIMES THROWN OUT OF USE FOR SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF THE DEMAND FOR LACE CAUSES THE RENTAL TO EQUAL IN TWO YEARS
7505-258964-0036 MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL COST AT SUCH TIMES THE VALUE OF FACTORIES INCREASES GREATLY BUT AFTER A FEW YEARS OF PROSPERITY BUSINESS AGAIN COLLAPSES
7505-258964-0037 SUCH PROSPEROUS PERIODS ARE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE BUSINESS MAN AND OF THE PROMOTER TO SELL THE FACTORY AT ITS HIGHEST PRICE MACHINERY ADAPTED ONLY FOR A SPECIAL PRODUCT
7505-258964-0038 WILL NOT SELL AS READILY WHEN LESS NEEDED FOR ITS SPECIAL USE AS THAT WHICH LIKE A TURNING LATHE CAN BE USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BUT THE MORE SPECIAL THE APPLIANCES NEEDED FOR A CERTAIN PRODUCT THE HIGHER
7505-258964-0039 MORE ABNORMAL WILL BE THEIR TEMPORARY VALUE WHEN THEY ARE SUDDENLY NEEDED LAND NEAR THE SITE OF AN EXPOSITION TAKES ON A VERY
7505-258964-0040 PUTS A CHECK OR SETS A LIMIT TO THE RISE IN THIS SEARCH FOR NEW DEVICES THE MAN WHO CAN SEE MOST QUICKLY AND CLEARLY HAS A KEY TO WEALTH
7505-258964-0041 SOME KINDS OF AGENTS AS RARE MINERALS OR TOOLS THAT CAN BE PRODUCED ONLY BY HIGHLY SKILLED LABOR CANNOT BE INCREASED RAPIDLY IN NUMBER AND REMAIN HIGH IN PRICE FOR A LONG PERIOD
7505-258964-0042 AND FAVORABLY LOCATED BUILDING SITES ILLUSTRATE THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN SOME CASES IT IS TRUE THE DEMAND MAY BE DUE TO SOME TEMPORARY CAUSE
7505-258964-0043 WATERWORKS GAS WORKS STREET RAILWAYS FERRIES AND WHARVES THIS EVIDENTLY IS ONLY A SPECIAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRINCIPLE JUST STATED WHERE IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE FOR CERTAIN AGENTS
7505-258964-0044 PUBLIC FRANCHISES ENTITLE THE OWNERS TO SPECIAL SOMETIMES EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGES AND PROTECT THEM LEGALLY FROM COMPETITION NOT ALL FRANCHISES ARE VALUABLE
7505-258964-0045 MANY STREET RAILWAYS ARE UNFORTUNATE VENTURES THE EARNINGS BEING INSUFFICIENT TO PAY EXPENSES TO SAY NOTHING OF INTEREST ON THE INVESTMENT BUT WHEN THEY PAY GREATLY
7505-258964-0046 THEIR HIGH VALUE IS DUE TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMPETITION THE CARS MULES DYNAMOS STEAM ENGINES
7505-258964-0047 DUE TO ACCIDENTAL AND SOCIAL CAUSES RAISING THE RENTS OF WEALTH THE TERM UNEARNED INCREMENT MAY BE DEFINED AS AN INCREASE IN RENTS OR VALUE OF AGENTS
7505-258964-0048 DUE TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE EFFORTS OR MERITS OF THE OWNER IN FACT IT IS THAT OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING IN SOME CASES POWERFUL OR WEALTHY MEN
7505-258964-0049 CAN BRING ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGES IN ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE WAYS THE OWNER OF A LARGE FACTORY MOVING IT INTO THE COUNTRY MAY BUY UP SURROUNDING LAND AND FOUND A CITY CONVERTING PASTURE LANDS AND CORN FIELDS
7505-258964-0050 IS POWERLESS TO AFFECT THE RESULT HE CAN ONLY ADAPT HIS CONDUCT IN SOME MEASURE SO AS TO REAP AN ADVANTAGE HE CAN STRIVE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER AND QUALITY
7505-258964-0051 AS WELL AS OF GAIN THE TERM UNEARNED INCREMENT HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY USED IN RECENT YEARS
7505-83618-0000 THEIR CULTURE MYTH WHICH HE HAS RECORDED
7505-83618-0001 THE BLOOD GUSHED FROM HIM AT EVERY STEP AND AS IT FELL TURNED INTO FLINT STONES THE VICTOR RETURNED TO HIS GRANDMOTHER AND ESTABLISHED HIS LODGE IN THE FAR EAST ON THE BORDERS OF THE GREAT OCEAN WHENCE THE SUN COMES IN TIME HE BECAME THE FATHER OF MANKIND
7505-83618-0002 OF THE EARLY NATIVE TRADITIONS SO STRONG IS THE RESEMBLANCE IOSKEHA BEARS TO MICHABO THAT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IN EXPLANATION OF THE LATTER WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR BOTH
7505-83618-0003 YET I DO NOT IMAGINE THAT THE ONE WAS COPIED OR BORROWED FROM THE OTHER WE CANNOT BE TOO CAUTIOUS IN ADOPTING SUCH A CONCLUSION THE TWO NATIONS WERE REMOTE IN EVERYTHING BUT GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION
7505-83618-0004 I CALL TO MIND ANOTHER SIMILAR MYTH IN IT A MOTHER IS ALSO SAID TO HAVE BROUGHT FORTH TWINS OR A PAIR OF TWINS AND TO HAVE PAID FOR THEM WITH HER LIFE AGAIN THE ONE IS DESCRIBED AS THE BRIGHT
7505-83618-0005 SCHOLARS LIKEWISE HAVE INTERPRETED THE MOTHER TO MEAN THE DAWN THE TWINS EITHER LIGHT AND DARKNESS OR THE FOUR WINDS YET THIS IS NOT ALGONKIN THEOLOGY NOR IS IT AT ALL RELATED TO THAT OF THE IROQUOIS
7505-83618-0006 IT IS THE STORY OF SARAMA IN THE RIG VEDA AND WAS WRITTEN IN SANSCRIT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE HIMALAYAS CENTURIES BEFORE HOMER SUCH UNIFORMITY POINTS NOT TO A COMMON SOURCE IN HISTORY
7505-83618-0007 BUT IN PSYCHOLOGY MAN CHIEFLY COGNIZANT OF HIS SOUL THROUGH HIS SENSES THOUGHT WITH AN AWFUL HORROR OF THE NIGHT WHICH DEPRIVED HIM OF THE USE OF ONE AND FORESHADOWED THE LOSS OF ALL THEREFORE
7505-83618-0008 LIGHT AND LIFE WERE TO HIM SYNONYMOUS THEREFORE ALL RELIGIONS PROMISE TO LEAD FROM NIGHT TO LIGHT FROM NIGHT TO HEAVENLY LIGHT THEREFORE HE WHO RESCUES IS EVER THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD
7505-83618-0009 A MESSIAH FAIRER THAN THE CHILDREN OF MEN FULFILLED IN THAT DAY WHEN HE APPEARED IN GARMENTS SO WHITE AS NO FULLER ON EARTH COULD WHITE THEM
7505-83618-0010 LANGUAGE ITSELF IS PROOF OF IT MANY ALGONKIN WORDS FOR EAST MORNING DAWN DAY LIGHT
7505-83618-0011 ARE DERIVED FROM A RADICAL SIGNIFYING WHITE
7505-83618-0012 BUT PACHACAMA ATTACKED AND DROVE HIM TO THE NORTH IRRITATED AT HIS DEFEAT HE TOOK WITH HIM THE RAIN AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THIS DAY THE SEA COAST OF PERU IS LARGELY AN ARID DESERT NOW WHEN WE ARE INFORMED THAT THE SOUTH WIND
7505-83618-0013 FOR ASKED THE INCAS
7505-83618-0014 FOR HE WAS ATTACKED WITH MURDEROUS INTENT BY THE BEINGS WHOM HE HAD CREATED WHEN HOWEVER SCORNING SUCH UNEQUAL COMBAT HE HAD MANIFESTED HIS POWER BY HURLING THE LIGHTNING ON THE HILL SIDES AND CONSUMING THE FORESTS
7505-83618-0015 THEY RECOGNIZED THEIR MAKER AND HUMBLED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM HE WAS RECONCILED AND TAUGHT THEM ARTS AND AGRICULTURE INSTITUTIONS AND RELIGION MERITING THE TITLE THEY GAVE HIM OF PACHAYACHACHIC
7505-83618-0016 TEACHER OF ALL THINGS AT LAST HE DISAPPEARED IN THE WESTERN OCEAN FOUR PERSONAGES COMPANIONS OR SONS WERE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH HIM
7505-83618-0017 TO A THIRD THE EAST TO A FOURTH THE WEST
7505-83618-0018 AND THAT OF MICHABO BOTH PRECEDE AND CREATE THE SUN BOTH JOURNEY TO THE WEST OVERCOMING OPPOSITION WITH THE THUNDERBOLT BOTH DIVIDE THE WORLD BETWEEN THE FOUR WINDS BOTH WERE THE FATHERS GODS AND TEACHERS OF THEIR NATIONS
7505-83618-0019 NOR DOES IT CEASE HERE MICHABO I HAVE SHOWN IS THE WHITE SPIRIT OF THE DAWN VIRACOCHA ALL AUTHORITIES TRANSLATE
7505-83618-0020 FOR HIS HIGH PRIEST ALWAYS BORE HIS NAME BUT HE HIMSELF IS A PURE CREATION OF THE FANCY AND ALL HIS ALLEGED HISTORY IS NOTHING BUT A MYTH HIS EMBLEMATIC NAME THE BIRD SERPENT AND HIS REBUS AND CROSS AT
7505-83618-0021 I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED OTHERS OF HIS TITLES WERE
7505-83618-0022 YOLCUAT THE RATTLESNAKE TOHIL THE RUMBLER HUEMAC THE STRONG HAND
7505-83618-0023 THE SAME DUALISM REAPPEARS IN HIM THAT HAS BEEN NOTED IN HIS ANALOGUES ELSEWHERE HE IS BOTH LORD OF THE EASTERN LIGHT AND THE WINDS AS THE FORMER HE WAS BORN OF A VIRGIN IN THE LAND OF TULA OR TLAPALLAN IN THE DISTANT ORIENT
7505-83618-0024 HE WAS FIGURATIVELY SAID TO SWEEP THE ROAD FOR HIM SINCE IN THAT COUNTRY VIOLENT WINDS ARE THE PRECURSORS OF THE WET SEASONS WHEREVER HE WENT ALL MANNER OF SINGING BIRDS BORE HIM COMPANY EMBLEMS OF THE WHISTLING BREEZES
7505-83618-0025 THE HILL OF SHOUTING WITH SUCH A MIGHTY VOICE THAT IT COULD BE HEARD A HUNDRED LEAGUES AROUND THE ARROWS WHICH HE SHOT TRANSFIXED GREAT TREES THE STONES HE THREW LEVELLED FORESTS
7505-83618-0026 AND WHEN HE LAID HIS HANDS ON THE ROCKS THE MARK WAS INDELIBLE YET AS THUS EMBLEMATIC OF THE THUNDER STORM HE POSSESSED IN FULL MEASURE
