8797-294123-0000 TO ACHIEVE A CORRECT APPRECIATION OF THE CHINESE
8797-294123-0001 AND THEN ONE FINE DAY CROSS OVER THE YALU INTO MANCHURIA IT WOULD BE OF EXCEPTIONAL ADVANTAGE TO THE CORRECTNESS OF APPRECIATION DID HE CROSS OVER THE YALU ON THE HEELS OF A HOSTILE AND ALIEN ARMY
8797-294123-0002 WAR IS TO DAY THE FINAL ARBITER IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN AND IT IS AS YET THE FINAL TEST OF THE WORTH WHILENESS OF PEOPLES TESTED THUS THE KOREAN FAILS
8797-294123-0003 HE LACKS THE NERVE TO REMAIN WHEN A STRANGE ARMY CROSSES HIS LAND THE FEW GOODS AND CHATTELS HE MAY HAVE MANAGED TO ACCUMULATE HE PUTS ON HIS BACK ALONG WITH HIS DOORS AND WINDOWS AND AWAY HE HEADS FOR HIS MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES
8797-294123-0004 LATER HE MAY RETURN SANS GOODS CHATTELS DOORS AND WINDOWS IMPELLED BY INSATIABLE CURIOSITY FOR A LOOK SEE BUT IT IS CURIOSITY MERELY A TIMID DEERLIKE CURIOSITY
8797-294123-0005 HE IS PREPARED TO BOUND AWAY ON HIS LONG LEGS AT THE FIRST HINT OF DANGER OR TROUBLE NORTHERN KOREA WAS A DESOLATE LAND WHEN THE JAPANESE PASSED THROUGH VILLAGES AND TOWNS WERE DESERTED
8797-294123-0006 THE FIELDS LAY UNTOUCHED THERE WAS NO PLOUGHING NOR SOWING NO GREEN THINGS GROWING LITTLE OR NOTHING WAS TO BE PURCHASED ONE CARRIED ONE'S OWN FOOD WITH HIM
8797-294123-0007 IN MANY A LONELY VILLAGE NOT AN OUNCE NOR A GRAIN OF ANYTHING COULD BE BOUGHT AND YET THERE MIGHT BE STANDING AROUND SCORES OF WHITE GARMENTED STALWART KOREANS SMOKING YARD LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING CHATTERING CEASELESSLY CHATTERING
8797-294123-0008 LOVE MONEY OR FORCE COULD NOT PROCURE FROM THEM A HORSESHOE OR A HORSESHOE NAIL UPSO WAS THEIR INVARIABLE REPLY UPSO CURSED WORD WHICH MEANS HAVE NOT GOT
8797-294123-0009 THEY HAD TRAMPED PROBABLY FORTY MILES THAT DAY DOWN FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES JUST FOR A LOOK SEE AND FORTY MILES BACK THEY WOULD CHEERFULLY TRAMP CHATTERING ALL THE WAY OVER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN
8797-294123-0010 AND THE GLOOM OF THE LANDSCAPE WILL BE FILLED WITH TALL FLITTING GHOSTS BOUNDING LIKE DEER WITH GREAT SPRINGY STRIDES WHICH ONE CANNOT BUT ENVY THEY HAVE SPLENDID VIGOUR AND FINE BODIES BUT THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEING BEATEN AND ROBBED WITHOUT PROTEST OR RESISTANCE
8797-294123-0011 BY EVERY CHANCE FOREIGNER WHO ENTERS THEIR COUNTRY FROM THIS NERVELESS FORSAKEN KOREAN LAND I RODE DOWN UPON THE SANDY ISLANDS OF THE YALU FOR WEEKS THESE ISLANDS HAD BEEN THE DREAD BETWEEN THE LINES OF TWO FIGHTING ARMIES
8797-294123-0012 THE AIR ABOVE HAD BEEN RENT BY SCREAMING PROJECTILES THE ECHOES OF THE FINAL BATTLE HAD SCARCELY DIED AWAY THE TRAINS OF JAPANESE WOUNDED AND JAPANESE DEAD WERE TRAILING BY
8797-294123-0013 ON THE CONICAL HILL A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY THE RUSSIAN DEAD WERE BEING BURIED IN THEIR TRENCHES AND IN THE SHELL HOLES MADE BY THE JAPANESE AND HERE IN THE THICK OF IT ALL A MAN WAS PLOUGHING GREEN THINGS WERE GROWING
8797-294123-0014 YOUNG ONIONS AND THE MAN WHO WAS WEEDING THEM PAUSED FROM HIS LABOUR LONG ENOUGH TO SELL ME A HANDFUL NEAR BY WAS THE SMOKE BLACKENED RUIN OF THE FARMHOUSE FIRED BY THE RUSSIANS WHEN THEY RETREATED FROM THE RIVERBED TWO MEN WERE REMOVING THE DEBRIS
8797-294123-0015 CLEANING THE CONFUSION PREPARATORY TO REBUILDING THEY WERE CLAD IN BLUE PIGTAILS HUNG DOWN THEIR BACKS I WAS IN CHINA I RODE TO THE SHORE INTO THE VILLAGE OF KUELIAN CHING
8797-294123-0016 THERE WERE NO LOUNGING MEN SMOKING LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING THE PREVIOUS DAY THE RUSSIANS HAD BEEN THERE A BLOODY BATTLE HAD BEEN FOUGHT AND TO DAY THE JAPANESE WERE THERE BUT WHAT WAS THAT TO TALK ABOUT EVERYBODY WAS BUSY
8797-294123-0017 MEN WERE OFFERING EGGS AND CHICKENS AND FRUIT FOR SALE UPON THE STREET AND BREAD AS I LIVE BREAD IN SMALL ROUND LOAVES OR BUNS I RODE ON INTO THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE A TOILING POPULATION WAS IN EVIDENCE
8797-294123-0018 THE HOUSES AND WALLS WERE STRONG AND SUBSTANTIAL STONE AND BRICK REPLACED THE MUD WALLS OF THE KOREAN DWELLINGS TWILIGHT FELL AND DEEPENED AND STILL THE PLOUGHS WENT UP AND DOWN THE FIELDS THE SOWERS FOLLOWING AFTER
8797-294123-0019 TRAINS OF WHEELBARROWS HEAVILY LOADED SQUEAKED BY AND PEKIN CARTS DRAWN BY FROM FOUR TO SIX COWS HORSES MULES PONIES OR JACKASSES COWS EVEN WITH THEIR NEWBORN CALVES TOTTERING ALONG ON PUNY LEGS OUTSIDE THE TRACES
8797-294123-0020 EVERYBODY WORKED EVERYTHING WORKED I SAW A MAN MENDING THE ROAD I WAS IN CHINA I CAME TO THE CITY OF ANTUNG AND LODGED WITH A MERCHANT HE WAS A GRAIN MERCHANT
8797-294123-0021 CORN HE HAD HUNDREDS OF BUSHELS STORED IN GREAT BINS OF STOUT MATTING PEAS AND BEANS IN SACKS AND IN THE BACK YARD HIS MILLSTONES WENT ROUND AND ROUND GRINDING OUT MEAL ALSO IN HIS BACK YARD WERE BUILDINGS CONTAINING VATS SUNK INTO THE GROUND
8797-294123-0022 AND HERE THE TANNERS WERE AT WORK MAKING LEATHER I BOUGHT A MEASURE OF CORN FROM MINE HOST FOR MY HORSES AND HE OVERCHARGED ME THIRTY CENTS I WAS IN CHINA ANTUNG WAS JAMMED WITH JAPANESE TROOPS
8797-294123-0023 IT WAS THE THICK OF WAR BUT IT DID NOT MATTER THE WORK OF ANTUNG WENT ON JUST THE SAME THE SHOPS WERE WIDE OPEN THE STREETS WERE LINED WITH PEDLARS ONE COULD BUY ANYTHING GET ANYTHING MADE
8797-294123-0024 I DINED AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT CLEANSED MYSELF AT A PUBLIC BATH IN A PRIVATE TUB WITH A SMALL BOY TO ASSIST IN THE SCRUBBING I BOUGHT CONDENSED MILK BITTER CANNED VEGETABLES BREAD AND CAKE I REPEAT IT CAKE GOOD CAKE
8797-294123-0025 I BOUGHT KNIVES FORKS AND SPOONS GRANITE WARE DISHES AND MUGS THERE WERE HORSESHOES AND HORSESHOERS A WORKER IN IRON REALIZED FOR ME NEW DESIGNS OF MINE FOR MY TENT POLES MY SHOES WERE SENT OUT TO BE REPAIRED
8797-294123-0026 A BARBER SHAMPOOED MY HAIR A SERVANT RETURNED WITH CORN BEEF IN TINS A BOTTLE OF PORT ANOTHER OF COGNAC AND BEER
8797-294123-0027 TO WASH OUT FROM MY THROAT THE DUST OF AN ARMY IT WAS THE LAND OF CANAAN I WAS IN CHINA THE KOREAN IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INEFFICIENCY OF UTTER WORTHLESSNESS
8797-294123-0028 THE CHINESE IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INDUSTRY FOR SHEER WORK NO WORKER IN THE WORLD CAN COMPARE WITH HIM WORK IS THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS IT IS HIS SOLUTION OF EXISTENCE
8797-294123-0029 LIBERTY TO HIM EPITOMIZES ITSELF IN ACCESS TO THE MEANS OF TOIL TO TILL THE SOIL AND LABOUR INTERMINABLY WITH RUDE IMPLEMENTS AND UTENSILS IS ALL HE ASKS OF LIFE AND OF THE POWERS THAT BE
8797-294123-0030 WORK IS WHAT HE DESIRES ABOVE ALL THINGS AND HE WILL WORK AT ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY DURING THE TAKING OF THE TAKU FORTS HE CARRIED SCALING LADDERS AT THE HEADS OF THE STORMING COLUMNS AND PLANTED THEM AGAINST THE WALLS
8797-294123-0031 HE DID THIS NOT FROM A SENSE OF PATRIOTISM BUT FOR THE INVADING FOREIGN DEVILS BECAUSE THEY PAID HIM A DAILY WAGE OF FIFTY CENTS HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED BY WAR HE ACCEPTS IT AS HE DOES RAIN AND SUNSHINE THE CHANGING OF THE SEASONS AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA
8797-294123-0032 HE PREPARES FOR IT ENDURES IT AND SURVIVES IT AND WHEN THE TIDE OF BATTLE SWEEPS BY
8797-294123-0033 HE IS SEEN CALMLY BENDING TO HIS USUAL TASKS NAY WAR ITSELF BEARS FRUITS WHEREOF HE MAY PICK BEFORE THE DEAD ARE COLD OR THE BURIAL SQUADS HAVE ARRIVED HE IS OUT ON THE FIELD
8797-294123-0034 STRIPPING THE MANGLED BODIES COLLECTING THE SHRAPNEL AND FERRETING IN THE SHELL HOLES FOR SLIVERS AND FRAGMENTS OF IRON THE CHINESE IS NO COWARD
8797-294123-0035 HE DOES NOT HIDE AWAY HIS CHICKENS AND HIS EGGS NOR ANY OTHER COMMODITY HE POSSESSES HE PROCEEDS AT ONCE TO OFFER THEM FOR SALE NOR IS HE TO BE BULLIED INTO LOWERING HIS PRICE
8797-294123-0036 HE HAS TWO LARGE PEARS SAVED OVER FROM LAST YEAR WHICH HE WILL SELL FOR FIVE SEN OR FOR THE SAME PRICE THREE SMALL PEARS WHAT IF ONE SOLDIER PERSIST IN TAKING AWAY WITH HIM THREE LARGE PEARS WHAT IF THERE BE TWENTY OTHER SOLDIERS JOSTLING ABOUT HIM
8797-294123-0037 AND THE SOLDIER RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FLIGHT
8797-294123-0038 NOR IS THE CHINESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE WHICH HE HAS BEEN SO OFTEN DESIGNATED HE IS NOT SO ILL DISPOSED TOWARD NEW IDEAS AND NEW METHODS AS HIS HISTORY WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE TRUE
8797-294123-0039 HIS FORMS CUSTOMS AND METHODS HAVE BEEN PERMANENT THESE MANY CENTURIES BUT THIS HAS BEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE LEARNED CLASSES AND THAT THESE GOVERNING SCHOLARS FOUND THEIR SALVATION LAY IN SUPPRESSING ALL PROGRESSIVE IDEAS
8797-294123-0040 AND BEEN SPREAD BY THEIR PAMPHLETS AND PROPAGANDISTS ORIGINALITY AND ENTERPRISE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED IN THE CHINESE FOR SCORES OF GENERATIONS ONLY HAS REMAINED TO HIM INDUSTRY
8797-294123-0041 ON THE OTHER HAND HIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEW IDEAS HAS BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED WHEREVER HE HAS ESCAPED BEYOND THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED UPON HIM BY HIS GOVERNMENT SO FAR AS THE BUSINESS MAN IS CONCERNED HE HAS GRASPED FAR MORE CLEARLY THE WESTERN CODE OF BUSINESS
8797-294123-0042 THE WESTERN ETHICS OF BUSINESS THAN HAS THE JAPANESE HE HAS LEARNED AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO KEEP HIS WORD OR HIS BOND AS YET THE JAPANESE BUSINESS MAN HAS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN HE HAS SIGNED A TIME CONTRACT
8797-294123-0043 AND WHEN CHANGING CONDITIONS CAUSE HIM TO LOSE BY IT THE JAPANESE MERCHANT CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT IT IS BEYOND HIS COMPREHENSION AND REPULSIVE TO HIS COMMON SENSE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT AND THEREBY LOSE MONEY
8797-294123-0044 HE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE CHANGING CONDITIONS THEMSELVES ABSOLVE HIM AND IN SO FAR ADAPTABLE AS HE HAS SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE IN OTHER RESPECTS
8797-294123-0045 HERE WE HAVE THE CHINESE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF HIM OCCUPYING A VAST LAND OF IMMENSE NATURAL RESOURCES RESOURCES OF A TWENTIETH CENTURY AGE OF A MACHINE AGE
8797-294123-0046 RESOURCES OF COAL AND IRON WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF COMMERCIAL CIVILIZATION
8797-294123-0047 TRULY WOULD HE OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE THE MUCH HERALDED YELLOW PERIL WERE IT NOT FOR HIS PRESENT MANAGEMENT THIS MANAGEMENT HIS GOVERNMENT IS SET CRYSTALLIZED IT IS WHAT BINDS HIM DOWN TO BUILDING AS HIS FATHERS BUILT
8797-294123-0048 THE GOVERNING CLASS ENTRENCHED BY THE PRECEDENT AND POWER OF CENTURIES AND BY THE STAMP IT HAS PUT UPON HIS MIND WILL NEVER FREE HIM IT WOULD BE THE SUICIDE OF THE GOVERNING CLASS AND THE GOVERNING CLASS KNOWS IT
8797-294123-0049 COMES NOW THE JAPANESE ON THE STREETS OF ANTUNG OF FENG WANG CHANG OR OF ANY OTHER MANCHURIAN CITY THE FOLLOWING IS A FAMILIAR SCENE
8797-294123-0050 ON ONE SIDE SQUATS A CHINESE CIVILIAN ON HIS HAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE SQUATS A JAPANESE SOLDIER
8797-294123-0051 THE OTHER NODS UNDERSTANDING SWEEPS THE DUST SLATE LEVEL WITH HIS HAND AND WITH HIS FOREFINGER INSCRIBES SIMILAR CHARACTERS THEY ARE TALKING THEY CANNOT SPEAK TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY CAN WRITE
8797-294123-0052 LONG AGO ONE BORROWED THE OTHER'S WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND LONG BEFORE THAT UNTOLD GENERATIONS AGO THEY DIVERGED FROM A COMMON ROOT THE ANCIENT MONGOL STOCK THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES
8797-294123-0053 DIFFERENTIATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVERSE CONDITIONS AND INFUSIONS OF OTHER BLOOD BUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR BEING TWISTED INTO THE FIBRES OF THEM IS A HERITAGE IN COMMON A SAMENESS IN KIND WHICH TIME HAS NOT OBLITERATED
8797-294123-0054 THE INFUSION OF OTHER BLOOD MALAY PERHAPS HAS MADE THE JAPANESE A RACE OF MASTERY AND POWER A FIGHTING RACE THROUGH ALL ITS HISTORY A RACE WHICH HAS ALWAYS DESPISED COMMERCE AND EXALTED FIGHTING TO DAY
8797-294123-0055 EQUIPPED WITH THE FINEST MACHINES AND SYSTEMS OF DESTRUCTION THE CAUCASIAN MIND HAS DEVISED HANDLING MACHINES AND SYSTEMS WITH REMARKABLE AND DEADLY ACCURACY THIS REJUVENESCENT JAPANESE RACE HAS EMBARKED ON A COURSE OF CONQUEST THE GOAL OF WHICH NO MAN KNOWS
8797-294123-0056 THE HEAD MEN OF JAPAN ARE DREAMING AMBITIOUSLY AND THE PEOPLE ARE DREAMING BLINDLY A NAPOLEONIC DREAM AND TO THIS DREAM THE JAPANESE CLINGS AND WILL CLING WITH BULL DOG TENACITY THE SOLDIER SHOUTING NIPPON BANZAI
8797-294123-0057 HER SOLE SUPPORT MAY GO TO THE FRONT ARE BOTH EXPRESSING THE UNANIMITY OF THE DREAM THE LATE DISTURBANCE IN THE FAR EAST MARKED THE CLASHING OF THE DREAMS FOR THE SLAV TOO IS DREAMING GREATLY
8797-294123-0058 GRANTING THAT THE JAPANESE CAN HURL BACK THE SLAV AND THAT THE TWO GREAT BRANCHES OF THE ANGLO SAXON RACE DO NOT DESPOIL HIM OF HIS SPOILS THE JAPANESE DREAM TAKES ON SUBSTANTIALITY
8797-294123-0059 BUT GIVEN POOR EMPTY KOREA FOR A BREEDING COLONY AND MANCHURIA FOR A GRANARY AND AT ONCE THE JAPANESE BEGINS TO INCREASE BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS EVEN SO HE WOULD NOT OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE A BROWN PERIL
8797-294123-0060 HE HAS NOT THE TIME IN WHICH TO GROW AND REALIZE THE DREAM HE IS ONLY FORTY FIVE MILLIONS AND SO FAST DOES THE ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION OF THE PLANET HURRY ON THE PLANET'S PARTITION AMONGST THE WESTERN PEOPLES THAT BEFORE HE COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE REQUISITE TO MENACE
8797-294123-0061 HE WOULD SEE THE WESTERN GIANTS IN POSSESSION OF THE VERY STUFF OF HIS DREAM THE MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD LIES NOT IN THE LITTLE BROWN MAN BUT IN THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF YELLOW MEN SHOULD THE LITTLE BROWN MAN UNDERTAKE THEIR MANAGEMENT
8797-294123-0062 THE CHINESE IS NOT DEAD TO NEW IDEAS HE IS AN EFFICIENT WORKER MAKES A GOOD SOLDIER AND IS WEALTHY IN THE ESSENTIAL MATERIALS OF A MACHINE AGE UNDER A CAPABLE MANAGEMENT HE WILL GO FAR
8797-294123-0063 THE JAPANESE IS PREPARED AND FIT TO UNDERTAKE THIS MANAGEMENT NOT ONLY HAS HE PROVED HIMSELF AN APT IMITATOR OF WESTERN MATERIAL PROGRESS A STURDY WORKER AND A CAPABLE ORGANIZER BUT HE IS FAR MORE FIT TO MANAGE THE CHINESE THAN ARE WE
8797-294123-0064 THE BAFFLING ENIGMA OF THE CHINESE CHARACTER IS NO BAFFLING ENIGMA TO HIM HE UNDERSTANDS AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES NOR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MENTAL PROCESSES ARE LARGELY THE SAME
8797-294123-0065 HE THINKS WITH THE SAME THOUGHT SYMBOLS AS DOES THE CHINESE AND HE THINKS IN THE SAME PECULIAR GROOVES HE GOES ON WHERE WE ARE BALKED BY THE OBSTACLES OF INCOMPREHENSION HE TAKES THE TURNING WHICH WE CANNOT PERCEIVE
8797-294123-0066 TWISTS AROUND THE OBSTACLE AND PRESTO IS OUT OF SIGHT IN THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE CHINESE MIND WHERE WE CANNOT FOLLOW THE CHINESE HAS BEEN CALLED THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE AND WELL HE HAS MERITED IT DOZING AS HE HAS THROUGH THE AGES
8797-294123-0067 AND AS TRULY WAS THE JAPANESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE UP TO A GENERATION AGO
8797-294123-0068 THE IDEAS OF THE WEST WERE THE LEAVEN WHICH QUICKENED THE JAPANESE AND THE IDEAS OF THE WEST TRANSMITTED BY THE JAPANESE MIND INTO IDEAS JAPANESE MAY WELL MAKE THE LEAVEN POWERFUL ENOUGH TO QUICKEN THE CHINESE
8797-294123-0069 WE HAVE HAD AFRICA FOR THE AFRIKANDER AND AT NO DISTANT DAY WE SHALL HEAR ASIA FOR THE ASIATIC FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INDEFATIGABLE WORKERS DEFT INTELLIGENT AND UNAFRAID TO DIE AROUSED AND REJUVENESCENT
8797-294123-0070 MANAGED AND GUIDED BY FORTY FIVE MILLION ADDITIONAL HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE SPLENDID FIGHTING ANIMALS SCIENTIFIC AND MODERN CONSTITUTE THAT MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD WHICH HAS BEEN WELL NAMED THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0071 THE POSSIBILITY OF RACE ADVENTURE HAS NOT PASSED AWAY WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF OUR OWN THE SLAV IS JUST GIRDING HIMSELF UP TO BEGIN WHY MAY NOT THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN START OUT ON AN ADVENTURE AS TREMENDOUS AS OUR OWN AND MORE STRIKINGLY UNIQUE
8797-294123-0072 IT IS NOT THE NATURE OF LIFE TO BELIEVE ITSELF WEAK THERE IS SUCH A THING AS RACE EGOTISM AS WELL AS CREATURE EGOTISM AND A VERY GOOD THING IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE WESTERN WORLD WILL NOT PERMIT THE RISE OF THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0073 IT ADVANCES THIS IDEA WITH PERSISTENCY AND DELIVERS ITSELF OF LONG ARGUMENTS SHOWING HOW AND WHY THIS MENACE WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO ARISE
8797-294123-0074 THE WESTERN WORLD IS WARNED IF NOT ARMED AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF IT IN THE SECOND PLACE THERE IS A WEAKNESS INHERENT IN THE BROWN MAN WHICH WILL BRING HIS ADVENTURE TO NAUGHT FROM THE WEST HE HAS BORROWED ALL OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT AND PASSED OUR ETHICAL ACHIEVEMENT BY
8797-294123-0075 OUR ENGINES OF PRODUCTION AND DESTRUCTION HE HAS MADE HIS WHAT WAS ONCE SOLELY OURS HE NOW DUPLICATES RIVALLING OUR MERCHANTS IN THE COMMERCE OF THE EAST THRASHING THE RUSSIAN ON SEA AND LAND A MARVELLOUS IMITATOR TRULY
8797-294123-0076 BUT IMITATING US ONLY IN THINGS MATERIAL THINGS SPIRITUAL CANNOT BE IMITATED THEY MUST BE FELT AND LIVED WOVEN INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF LIFE AND HERE THE JAPANESE FAILS
8797-294123-0077 IT REQUIRED NO REVOLUTION OF HIS NATURE TO LEARN TO CALCULATE THE RANGE AND FIRE A FIELD GUN OR TO MARCH THE GOOSE STEP IT WAS A MERE MATTER OF TRAINING OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF OUR INTELLECT
8797-294123-0078 IT IS KNOWLEDGE AND KNOWLEDGE LIKE COIN IS INTERCHANGEABLE IT IS NOT WRAPPED UP IN THE HEREDITY OF THE NEW BORN CHILD BUT IS SOMETHING TO BE ACQUIRED AFTERWARD
8797-294123-0079 OUR SOUL STUFF IS NOT A COIN TO BE POCKETED BY THE FIRST CHANCE COMER THE JAPANESE CANNOT POCKET IT ANY MORE THAN HE CAN THRILL TO SHORT SAXON WORDS OR WE CAN THRILL TO CHINESE HIEROGLYPHICS THE LEOPARD CANNOT CHANGE ITS SPOTS NOR CAN THE JAPANESE
8797-294123-0080 NOR CAN WE WE ARE THUMBED BY THE AGES INTO WHAT WE ARE AND BY NO CONSCIOUS INWARD EFFORT CAN WE IN A DAY RETHUMB OURSELVES NOR CAN THE JAPANESE IN A DAY OR A GENERATION RETHUMB HIMSELF IN OUR IMAGE
8797-294123-0081 BACK OF OUR OWN GREAT RACE ADVENTURE BACK OF OUR ROBBERIES BY SEA AND LAND OUR LUSTS AND VIOLENCES AND ALL THE EVIL THINGS WE HAVE DONE THERE IS A CERTAIN INTEGRITY A STERNNESS OF CONSCIENCE A MELANCHOLY RESPONSIBILITY OF LIFE
8797-294123-0082 A SYMPATHY AND COMRADESHIP AND WARM HUMAN FEEL WHICH IS OURS INDUBITABLY OURS AND WHICH WE CANNOT TEACH TO THE ORIENTAL AS WE WOULD TEACH LOGARITHMS OR THE TRAJECTORY OF PROJECTILES
8797-294123-0083 THAT WE HAVE GROPED FOR THE WAY OF RIGHT CONDUCT AND AGONIZED OVER THE SOUL BETOKENS OUR SPIRITUAL ENDOWMENT THOUGH WE HAVE STRAYED OFTEN AND FAR FROM RIGHTEOUSNESS THE VOICES OF THE SEERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RAISED
8797-294123-0084 AND WE HAVE HARKED BACK TO THE BIDDING OF CONSCIENCE THE COLOSSAL FACT OF OUR HISTORY IS THAT WE HAVE MADE THE RELIGION OF JESUS CHRIST OUR RELIGION NO MATTER HOW DARK IN ERROR AND DEED OURS HAS BEEN A HISTORY OF SPIRITUAL STRUGGLE AND ENDEAVOUR
8797-294123-0085 WE ARE PRE EMINENTLY A RELIGIOUS RACE WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT WE ARE A RIGHT SEEKING RACE
8797-294123-0086 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY HAVE NO SOUL WAS HER ANSWER THIS MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT THE JAPANESE IS WITHOUT SOUL BUT IT SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE THE ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR SOULS AND THIS WOMAN'S SOUL
8797-294123-0087 THERE WAS NO FEEL NO SPEECH NO RECOGNITION THIS WESTERN SOUL DID NOT DREAM THAT THE EASTERN SOUL EXISTED IT WAS SO DIFFERENT SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT RELIGION AS A BATTLE FOR THE RIGHT IN OUR SENSE OF RIGHT
8797-294123-0088 AS A YEARNING AND A STRIFE FOR SPIRITUAL GOOD AND PURITY IS UNKNOWN TO THE JAPANESE MEASURED BY WHAT RELIGION MEANS TO US THE JAPANESE IS A RACE WITHOUT RELIGION YET IT HAS A RELIGION
8797-294123-0089 AS ONE JAPANESE HAS WRITTEN OUR REFLECTION BROUGHT INTO PROMINENCE NOT SO MUCH THE MORAL AS THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO US THE COUNTRY IS MORE THAN LAND AND SOIL FROM WHICH TO MINE GOLD OR REAP GRAIN
8797-294123-0090 IT IS THE SACRED ABODE OF THE GODS THE SPIRIT OF OUR FOREFATHERS TO US THE EMPEROR IS MORE THAN THE ARCH CONSTABLE OF A REICHSSTAAT OR EVEN THE PATRON OF A KULTURSTAAT HE IS THE BODILY REPRESENTATIVE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH
8797-294123-0091 BLENDING IN HIS PERSON ITS POWER AND ITS MERCY THE RELIGION OF JAPAN IS PRACTICALLY A WORSHIP OF THE STATE ITSELF PATRIOTISM IS THE EXPRESSION OF THIS WORSHIP THE JAPANESE MIND DOES NOT SPLIT HAIRS AS TO WHETHER THE EMPEROR IS HEAVEN INCARNATE OR THE STATE INCARNATE
8797-294123-0092 SO FAR AS THE JAPANESE ARE CONCERNED THE EMPEROR LIVES IS HIMSELF DEITY THE EMPEROR IS THE OBJECT TO LIVE FOR AND TO DIE FOR THE JAPANESE IS NOT AN INDIVIDUALIST
8797-294123-0093 HE HAS DEVELOPED NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS INSTEAD OF MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN HIS OWN MORAL WELFARE EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT IS THE WELFARE OF THE STATE THE HONOUR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PER SE DOES NOT EXIST
8797-294123-0094 ONLY EXISTS THE HONOUR OF THE STATE WHICH IS HIS HONOUR HE DOES NOT LOOK UPON HIMSELF AS A FREE AGENT WORKING OUT HIS OWN PERSONAL SALVATION SPIRITUAL AGONIZING IS UNKNOWN TO HIM HE HAS A SENSE OF CALM TRUST IN FATE
8797-294123-0095 A QUIET SUBMISSION TO THE INEVITABLE A STOIC COMPOSURE IN SIGHT OF DANGER OR CALAMITY A DISDAIN OF LIFE AND FRIENDLINESS WITH DEATH HE RELATES HIMSELF TO THE STATE AS AMONGST BEES THE WORKER IS RELATED TO THE HIVE HIMSELF NOTHING
8797-294123-0096 THE STATE EVERYTHING HIS REASONS FOR EXISTENCE THE EXALTATION AND GLORIFICATION OF THE STATE THE MOST ADMIRED QUALITY TO DAY OF THE JAPANESE IS HIS PATRIOTISM
8797-294123-0097 THE WESTERN WORLD IS IN RHAPSODIES OVER IT UNWITTINGLY MEASURING THE JAPANESE PATRIOTISM BY ITS OWN CONCEPTIONS OF PATRIOTISM FOR GOD MY COUNTRY AND THE CZAR CRIES THE RUSSIAN PATRIOT
8797-294123-0098 BUT IN THE JAPANESE MIND THERE IS NO DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE THREE THE EMPEROR IS THE EMPEROR AND GOD AND COUNTRY AS WELL THE PATRIOTISM OF THE JAPANESE IS BLIND AND UNSWERVING LOYALTY TO WHAT IS PRACTICALLY AN ABSOLUTISM
8797-294123-0099 THE EMPEROR CAN DO NO WRONG NOR CAN THE FIVE AMBITIOUS GREAT MEN WHO HAVE HIS EAR AND CONTROL THE DESTINY OF JAPAN NO GREAT RACE ADVENTURE CAN GO FAR NOR ENDURE LONG WHICH HAS NO DEEPER FOUNDATION THAN MATERIAL SUCCESS
8797-294123-0100 NO HIGHER PROMPTING THAN CONQUEST FOR CONQUEST'S SAKE AND MERE RACE GLORIFICATION TO GO FAR AND TO ENDURE IT MUST HAVE BEHIND IT AN ETHICAL IMPULSE A SINCERELY CONCEIVED RIGHTEOUSNESS
8797-294123-0101 BUT IT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ABOVE POSTULATE IS ITSELF A PRODUCT OF WESTERN RACE EGOTISM URGED BY OUR BELIEF IN OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FOSTERED BY A FAITH IN OURSELVES WHICH MAY BE AS ERRONEOUS AS ARE MOST FOND RACE FANCIES
8797-294123-0102 SO BE IT THE WORLD IS WHIRLING FASTER TO DAY THAN EVER BEFORE IT HAS GAINED IMPETUS AFFAIRS RUSH TO CONCLUSION THE FAR EAST IS THE POINT OF CONTACT OF THE ADVENTURING WESTERN PEOPLE AS WELL AS OF THE ASIATIC
8797-294123-0103 WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR OUR CHILDREN'S TIME NOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE SHALL OURSELVES SEE AND LARGELY DETERMINE THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN FENG WANG CHENG MANCHURIA
8838-298545-0000 HE SAT IN SILENCE WITH HIS FINE SHOULDERS BOWED AND HIS HEAD UPON HIS HANDS OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GRIMY SURGERY WINDOW OVER A FOREGROUND OF BLACKENED BRICK AND SLATE A LINE OF ENORMOUS CHIMNEYS LIKE CYCLOPEAN PILLARS
8838-298545-0001 UPHELD THE LOWERING DUN COLOURED CLOUD BANK FOR SIX DAYS IN THE WEEK THEY SPOUTED SMOKE BUT TO DAY THE FURNACE FIRES WERE BANKED FOR IT WAS SUNDAY SORDID AND POLLUTING GLOOM HUNG OVER A DISTRICT BLIGHTED AND BLASTED BY THE GREED OF MAN
8838-298545-0002 HE SHOULD BE BACK AGAIN AT THE UNIVERSITY COMPLETING THE LAST YEAR WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM HIS MEDICAL DEGREE BUT ALAS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY WITH WHICH TO PAY HIS CLASS FEES NOR COULD HE IMAGINE HOW HE COULD PROCURE IT
8838-298545-0003 HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS BLACK MEDITATION BY THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR OLDACRE HIMSELF A LARGE CLEAN SHAVEN RESPECTABLE MAN WITH A PRIM MANNER AND AN AUSTERE FACE HE HAD PROSPERED EXCEEDINGLY BY THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL CHURCH INTEREST
8838-298545-0004 AND THE RULE OF HIS LIFE WAS NEVER BY WORD OR ACTION TO RUN A RISK OF OFFENDING THE SENTIMENT WHICH HAD MADE HIM HIS STANDARD OF RESPECTABILITY AND OF DIGNITY WAS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH AND HE EXPECTED THE SAME FROM HIS ASSISTANTS
8838-298545-0005 HIS APPEARANCE AND WORDS WERE ALWAYS VAGUELY BENEVOLENT A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER THE DESPONDENT STUDENT HE WOULD TEST THE REALITY OF THIS PHILANTHROPY I BEG YOUR PARDON DOCTOR OLDACRE SAID HE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR
8838-298545-0006 I HAVE A GREAT FAVOUR TO ASK OF YOU THE DOCTOR'S APPEARANCE WAS NOT ENCOURAGING HIS MOUTH SUDDENLY TIGHTENED AND HIS EYES FELL YES MISTER MONTGOMERY YOU ARE AWARE SIR THAT I NEED ONLY ONE MORE SESSION TO COMPLETE MY COURSE

8838-298545-0008 IF YOU LIKE I WILL WORK IT OFF AFTER I AM QUALIFIED THE DOCTOR'S LIPS HAD THINNED INTO A NARROW LINE HIS EYES WERE RAISED AGAIN AND SPARKLED INDIGNANTLY YOUR REQUEST IS UNREASONABLE MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0009 CONSIDER SIR HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF MEDICAL STUDENTS THERE ARE IN THIS COUNTRY NO DOUBT THERE ARE MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEIR FEES AM I TO PROVIDE FOR THEM ALL OR WHY SHOULD I MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN YOUR FAVOUR I AM GRIEVED AND DISAPPOINTED MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0010 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT ME INTO THE PAINFUL POSITION OF HAVING TO REFUSE YOU HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND WALKED WITH OFFENDED DIGNITY OUT OF THE SURGERY THE STUDENT SMILED BITTERLY AND TURNED TO HIS WORK OF MAKING UP THE MORNING PRESCRIPTIONS
8838-298545-0011 HE ONLY EXCELLED IN HIS STRENGTH AND WHERE WAS HE TO FIND A CUSTOMER FOR THAT BUT THE WAYS OF FATE ARE STRANGE AND HIS CUSTOMER WAS AT HAND LOOK Y'ERE SAID A VOICE AT THE DOOR MONTGOMERY LOOKED UP
8838-298545-0012 FOR THE VOICE WAS A LOUD AND RASPING ONE A YOUNG MAN STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE A STOCKY BULL NECKED YOUNG MINER IN TWEED SUNDAY CLOTHES AND AN AGGRESSIVE NECK TIE HE WAS A SINISTER LOOKING FIGURE WITH DARK INSOLENT EYES
8838-298545-0013 AND THE JAW AND THROAT OF A BULLDOG LOOK Y'ERE SAID HE AGAIN WHY HAST THOU NOT SENT T MEDICINE OOP AS THY MASTER ORDERED MONTGOMERY HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE BRUTAL FRANKNESS OF THE NORTHERN WORKER AT FIRST IT HAD ENRAGED HIM
8838-298545-0014 BUT AFTER A TIME HE HAD GROWN CALLOUS TO IT AND ACCEPTED IT AS IT WAS MEANT BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT WAS INSOLENCE BRUTAL OVERBEARING INSOLENCE WITH PHYSICAL MENACE BEHIND IT WHAT NAME HE ASKED COLDLY
8838-298545-0015 THE PROVOCATION WAS SO GROSS THE INSULT SO UNPROVOKED THAT HE COULD HAVE NONE OF THOSE QUALMS WHICH TAKE THE EDGE OFF A MAN'S METTLE HE FINISHED SEALING THE BOTTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS OCCUPIED AND HE ADDRESSED IT AND PLACED IT CAREFULLY IN THE RACK
8838-298545-0016 LOOK HERE SAID HE TURNING ROUND TO THE MINER YOUR MEDICINE WILL BE MADE UP IN ITS TURN AND SENT DOWN TO YOU I DON'T ALLOW FOLK IN THE SURGERY WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE WAITING ROOM IF YOU WISH TO WAIT AT ALL YOONG MAN SAID THE MINER
8838-298545-0017 THE BLOWS WERE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS A SAVAGE SWING WHICH WHISTLED PAST MONTGOMERY'S EAR AND A STRAIGHT DRIVE WHICH TOOK THE WORKMAN ON THE CHIN LUCK WAS WITH THE ASSISTANT THAT SINGLE WHIZZING UPPERCUT AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS DELIVERED
8838-298545-0018 HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE ASSISTANT BREATHING FIERCELY THROUGH HIS NOSE BUT NO ANSWER CAME THE MAN WAS INSENSIBLE AND THEN THE DANGER OF HIS POSITION CAME UPON MONTGOMERY AND HE TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS ANTAGONIST
8838-298545-0019 A SUNDAY THE IMMACULATE DOCTOR OLDACRE WITH HIS PIOUS CONNECTION A SAVAGE BRAWL WITH A PATIENT HE WOULD IRRETRIEVABLY LOSE HIS SITUATION IF THE FACTS CAME OUT IT WAS NOT MUCH OF A SITUATION BUT HE COULD NOT GET ANOTHER WITHOUT A REFERENCE
8838-298545-0020 LOOSENED HIS COLLAR AND SQUEEZED THE SURGERY SPONGE OVER HIS FACE HE SAT UP AT LAST WITH A GASP AND A SCOWL DOMN THEE THOU'S SPOILT MY NECK TIE SAID HE MOPPING UP THE WATER FROM HIS BREAST
8838-298545-0021 I'M SORRY I HIT YOU SO HARD SAID MONTGOMERY APOLOGETICALLY THOU HIT ME HARD I COULD STAN SUCH FLY FLAPPIN ALL DAY TWAS THIS HERE PRESS THAT CRACKED MY PATE FOR ME AND THOU ART A LOOKY MAN TO BE ABLE TO BOAST AS THOU HAST OUTED ME
8838-298545-0022 AND NOW I'D BE OBLIGED TO THEE IF THOU WILT GIVE ME T WIFE'S MEDICINE MONTGOMERY GLADLY MADE IT UP AND HANDED IT TO THE MINER YOU ARE WEAK STILL SAID HE WON'T YOU STAY AWHILE AND REST T WIFE WANTS HER MEDICINE
8838-298545-0023 SAID THE MAN AND LURCHED OUT AT THE DOOR THE ASSISTANT LOOKING AFTER HIM SAW HIM ROLLING WITH AN UNCERTAIN STEP DOWN THE STREET UNTIL A FRIEND MET HIM AND THEY WALKED ON ARM IN ARM THE MAN SEEMED IN HIS ROUGH NORTHERN FASHION TO BEAR NO GRUDGE
8838-298545-0024 YET ALL DAY HE WAS AWARE OF A SENSE OF VAGUE UNEASINESS WHICH SHARPENED INTO DISMAY WHEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS INFORMED THAT THREE GENTLEMEN HAD CALLED AND WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE SURGERY A CORONER'S INQUEST
8838-298545-0025 ABOVE ALL WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT FROM HIM WAS A MOST INEXPLICABLE PROBLEM THE FIRST WAS SORLEY WILSON THE SON OF THE OWNER OF THE NONPAREIL COALPIT HE WAS A YOUNG BLOOD OF TWENTY HEIR TO A FORTUNE A KEEN SPORTSMAN
8838-298545-0026 AND DOWN FOR THE EASTER VACATION FROM MAGDALENE COLLEGE HE SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF THE SURGERY TABLE LOOKING IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE AT MONTGOMERY AND TWISTING THE ENDS OF HIS SMALL BLACK WAXED MOUSTACHE THE SECOND WAS PURVIS THE PUBLICAN
8838-298545-0027 AND HE ALSO LEANED FORWARD IN SILENCE FROM HIS CHAIR A FAT RED HAND UPON EITHER KNEE AND STARED CRITICALLY AT THE YOUNG ASSISTANT SO DID THE THIRD VISITOR FAWCETT THE HORSE BREAKER WHO LEANED BACK HIS LONG THIN LEGS WITH THEIR BOXCLOTH RIDING GAITERS
8838-298545-0028 NO IT'S OFF IT'S NOWT STAND OOP LAD LET'S SEE THEE STANDIN IT WAS THE PUBLICAN WHO SPOKE MONTGOMERY OBEYED HE WOULD LEARN ALL ABOUT IT NO DOUBT IF HE WERE PATIENT
8838-298545-0029 A HUNDRED AND THIRTY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IF HE'S AN OUNCE WELL THE MASTER DOESN'T SCALE MUCH MORE THAN THAT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS HOG FAT AND LIVING HIGH WORK THE GREASE OUT OF HIM AND I LAY THERE'S NO GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
8838-298545-0030 HAVE YOU BEEN WEIGHED LATELY MISTER MONTGOMERY IT WAS THE FIRST DIRECT QUESTION WHICH HAD BEEN ASKED HIM HE HAD STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THEM LIKE A HORSE AT A FAIR AND HE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO WONDER WHETHER HE WAS MORE ANGRY OR AMUSED I AM JUST ELEVEN STONE SAID HE
8838-298545-0031 BUT TRAININ FOR EVERYDAY WORK AIN'T THE SAME AS TRAININ WITH A TRAINER AND I DARE BET WITH ALL RESPEC TO YOUR OPINION MISTER WILSON THAT THERE'S HALF A STONE OF TALLOW ON HIM AT THIS MINUTE THE YOUNG CANTAB PUT HIS FINGERS ON THE ASSISTANT'S UPPER ARM
8838-298545-0032 THEN WITH HIS OTHER HAND ON HIS WRIST HE BENT THE FOREARM SHARPLY AND FELT THE BICEPS AS ROUND AND HARD AS A CRICKET BALL SPRING UP UNDER HIS FINGERS FEEL THAT SAID HE THE PUBLICAN AND HORSE BREAKER FELT IT WITH AN AIR OF REVERENCE
8838-298545-0033 GOOD LAD HE'LL DO YET CRIED PURVIS GENTLEMEN SAID MONTGOMERY I THINK THAT YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE BOON VERY PATIENT WITH YOU
8838-298545-0034 AND NOW I MUST REALLY BEG THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TELL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER THEY ALL SAT DOWN IN THEIR SERIOUS BUSINESS LIKE WAY THAT'S EASY DONE MISTER MONTGOMERY SAID THE FAT VOICED PUBLICAN BUT BEFORE SAYIN ANYTHING WE HAD TO WAIT AND SEE WHETHER
8838-298545-0035 FOR IT WOULD BE SOMETHIN NEW TO FIND ISAAC FAWCETT AS A SPOIL SPORT WELL THEN WE WILL MAKE UP THE HUNDRED FOR THE STAKE AMONG US AND THE FIGHT STANDS ALWAYS SUPPOSIN THE YOUNG MAN IS WILLIN EXCUSE ALL THIS ROT MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0036 SAID THE UNIVERSITY MAN IN A GENIAL VOICE WE'VE BEGUN AT THE WRONG END I KNOW BUT WE'LL SOON STRAIGHTEN IT OUT
8838-298545-0037 YOU REMEMBER THE MAN WHOM YOU KNOCKED OUT THIS MORNING HE IS BARTON THE FAMOUS TED BARTON I'M SURE SIR YOU MAY WELL BE PROUD TO HAVE OUTED HIM IN ONE ROUND SAID THE PUBLICAN WHY IT TOOK MORRIS THE TEN STONE SIX CHAMPION
8838-298545-0038 A DEAL MORE TROUBLE THAN THAT BEFORE HE PUT BARTON TO SLEEP YOU'VE DONE A FINE PERFORMANCE SIR AND HAPPEN YOU'LL DO A FINER IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE CHANCE I NEVER HEARD OF TED BARTON BEYOND SEEING THE NAME ON A MEDICINE LABEL SAID THE ASSISTANT WELL
8838-298545-0039 YOU MAY TAKE IT FROM ME THAT HE'S A SLAUGHTERER SAID THE HORSE BREAKER YOU'VE TAUGHT HIM A LESSON THAT HE NEEDED FOR IT WAS ALWAYS A WORD AND A BLOW WITH HIM AND THE WORD ALONE WAS WORTH FIVE SHILLIN IN A PUBLIC COURT HE WON'T BE SO READY NOW TO SHAKE HIS NIEF IN THE FACE OF EVERYONE HE MEETS
8838-298545-0040 HOWEVER THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE MONTGOMERY LOOKED AT THEM IN BEWILDERMENT FOR GOODNESS SAKE GENTLEMEN TELL ME WHAT IT IS YOU WANT ME TO DO HE CRIED WE WANT YOU TO FIGHT SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298545-0041 BUT WHY BECAUSE TED BARTON WAS TO HAVE FOUGHT HIM NEXT SATURDAY HE WAS THE CHAMPION OF THE WILSON COAL PITS AND THE OTHER WAS THE MASTER OF THE IRON FOLK DOWN AT THE CROXLEY SMELTERS WE'D MATCHED OUR MAN FOR A PURSE OF A HUNDRED AGAINST THE MASTER
8838-298545-0042 BUT YOU'VE QUEERED OUR MAN AND HE CAN'T FACE SUCH A BATTLE WITH A TWO INCH CUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE SIR
8838-298545-0043 IF YOU CAN LICK TED BARTON YOU MAY LICK THE MASTER OF CROXLEY BUT IF YOU DON'T WE'RE DONE FOR THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WHO IS IN THE SAME STREET WITH HIM IN THIS DISTRICT IT'S TWENTY ROUNDS TWO OUNCE GLOVES QUEENSBERRY RULES AND A DECISION ON POINTS IF YOU FIGHT TO THE FINISH
8838-298545-0044 FOR A MOMENT THE ABSURDITY OF THE THING DROVE EVERY OTHER THOUGHT OUT OF MONTGOMERY'S HEAD
8838-298545-0045 ALL HE WANTED TO COMPLETE HIS EDUCATION WAS LYING THERE READY TO HIS HAND IF ONLY THAT HAND WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO PICK IT UP HE HAD THOUGHT BITTERLY THAT MORNING THAT THERE WAS NO MARKET FOR HIS STRENGTH
8838-298545-0046 THAN HIS BRAINS IN A YEAR BUT A CHILL OF DOUBT CAME OVER HIM HOW CAN I FIGHT FOR THE COAL PITS SAID HE I AM NOT CONNECTED WITH THEM EH LAD BUT THOU ART CRIED OLD PURVIS WE'VE GOT IT DOWN IN WRITIN AND IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH
8838-298545-0047 IT WOULD BE A VERY SPORTING THING OF YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY IF YOU WOULD COME TO OUR HELP WHEN WE ARE IN SUCH A HOLE OF COURSE YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE TO TAKE THE HUNDRED POUNDS BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IN THE CASE OF YOUR WINNING WE COULD ARRANGE THAT IT SHOULD TAKE THE FORM OF A WATCH OR PIECE OF PLATE
8838-298545-0048 OR ANY OTHER SHAPE WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST ITSELF TO YOU YOU SEE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR HAVING LOST OUR CHAMPION SO WE REALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE A CLAIM UPON YOU GIVE ME A MOMENT GENTLEMEN IT IS VERY UNEXPECTED
8838-298545-0049 I AM AFRAID THE DOCTOR WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO MY GOING IN FACT I AM SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT BUT HE NEED NEVER KNOW NOT BEFORE THE FIGHT AT ANY RATE WE ARE NOT BOUND TO GIVE THE NAME OF OUR MAN SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE WEIGHT LIMITS ON THE DAY OF THE FIGHT THAT IS ALL THAT CONCERNS ANYONE
8838-298545-0050 THOU'LL RISE IN ONE DAY FROM BEING JUST A COMMON DOCTOR TO THE BEST KNOWN MON TWIXT HERE AND BRADFORD THOU ART A WITHERIN TYKE THOU ART AND NO MISTAKE AND IF THOU BEAT THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL THE BEER THOU WANT FOR THE REST OF THY LIFE WAITING FOR THEE AT THE FOUR SACKS
8838-298545-0051 IT IS THE MOST SPORTING THING I EVER HEARD OF IN MY LIFE SAID YOUNG WILSON BY GEORGE SIR IF YOU PULL IT OFF YOU'VE GOT THE CONSTITUENCY IN YOUR POCKET IF YOU CARE TO STAND YOU KNOW THE OUT HOUSE IN MY GARDEN NEXT THE ROAD EXACTLY
8838-298545-0052 THEN YOU'LL WANT A SPARRING PARTNER OGILVY HAS BEEN ACTING FOR BARTON BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT HE IS CLASS ENOUGH BARTON BEARS YOU NO GRUDGE HE'S A GOOD HEARTED FELLOW THOUGH CROSS GRAINED WITH STRANGERS HE LOOKED UPON YOU AS A STRANGER THIS MORNING BUT HE SAYS HE KNOWS YOU NOW
8838-298546-0000 IT WAS TRUE THAT HIS TEACHER WAS LONG PAST HIS PRIME SLOW UPON HIS FEET AND STIFF IN HIS JOINTS BUT EVEN SO HE WAS STILL A TOUGH ANTAGONIST BUT MONTGOMERY HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT HE COULD MORE THAN HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIM HE HAD WON THE UNIVERSITY MEDAL AND HIS TEACHER
8838-298546-0001 IN WHICH HE HAD THE WORST OF IT BUT HAD MADE THE PRIZE FIGHTER STRETCH HIMSELF TO THE UTTERMOST THERE WAS HIS WHOLE RECORD AND WAS IT ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STAND UP TO THE MASTER OF CROXLEY HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE MASTER BEFORE
8838-298546-0002 BUT THEN HE HAD LOST TOUCH OF THE RING DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HARD WORK AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER IF HE WON THERE WAS THE MONEY WHICH MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM IF HE LOST IT WOULD ONLY MEAN A THRASHING HE COULD TAKE PUNISHMENT WITHOUT FLINCHING OF THAT HE WAS CERTAIN
8838-298546-0003 MATCHED AGAINST A PUGILIST OVER AT CROXLEY I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE LAW DOES NOT STEP IN AND STOP SO DEGRADING AN EXHIBITION IT IS REALLY A PRIZE FIGHT A GLOVE FIGHT YOU SAID
8838-298546-0004 I AM INFORMED THAT A TWO OZ GLOVE IS AN EVASION BY WHICH THEY DODGE THE LAW AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE TO INTERFERE
8838-298546-0005 TO THINK THAT SUCH SCENES CAN BE ENACTED WITHIN A FEW MILES OF OUR PEACEFUL HOME BUT YOU WILL REALISE MISTER MONTGOMERY THAT WHILE THERE ARE SUCH INFLUENCES FOR US TO COUNTERACT IT IS VERY NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD LIVE UP TO OUR HIGHEST
8838-298546-0006 THE DOCTOR'S SERMON WOULD HAVE HAD MORE EFFECT IF THE ASSISTANT HAD NOT ONCE OR TWICE HAD OCCASION TO TEST HIS HIGHEST AND COME UPON IT AT UNEXPECTEDLY HUMBLE ELEVATIONS IT IS ALWAYS SO PARTICULARLY EASY TO
8838-298546-0007 COMPOUND FOR SINS WE'RE MOST INCLINED TO BY DAMNING THOSE WE HAVE NO MIND TO IN ANY CASE MONTGOMERY FELT THAT OF ALL THE MEN CONCERNED IN SUCH A FIGHT PROMOTERS BACKERS SPECTATORS IT IS THE ACTUAL FIGHTER
8838-298546-0008 WHO HOLDS THE STRONGEST AND MOST HONOURABLE POSITION HIS CONSCIENCE GAVE HIM NO CONCERN UPON THE SUBJECT ENDURANCE AND COURAGE ARE VIRTUES NOT VICES AND BRUTALITY IS AT LEAST BETTER THAN EFFEMINACY
8838-298546-0009 THE ASSISTANT STROLLED DOWN THERE AFTER TEA AND ASKED IN A CASUAL WAY WHETHER THE TOBACCONIST HAD EVER HEARD OF THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298546-0010 THE LITTLE MAN COULD HARDLY ARTICULATE IN HIS ASTONISHMENT WHY SIR HE'S THE FIRST MON O THE DISTRICT AN HIS NAME'S AS WELL KNOWN IN THE WEST RIDING AS THE WINNER O T DERBY BUT LOR SIR HERE HE STOPPED AND RUMMAGED AMONG A HEAP OF PAPERS
8838-298546-0011 AND SO THE CROXLEY HERALD HAS HIS LIFE AN RECORD AN HERE IT IS AN THOU CANST READ IT FOR THYSEL THE SHEET OF THE PAPER WHICH HE HELD UP WAS A LAKE OF PRINT AROUND AN ISLET OF ILLUSTRATION THE LATTER WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT OF A PUGILIST'S HEAD AND NECK
8838-298546-0012 SILAS CRAGGS AND BENEATH THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL ABOUT HIM THERE SIR SAID THE TOBACCONIST HE'S A WITHERIN TYKE HE IS AND WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE HIM IN THE COUNTY IF HE HADN'T BROKE HIS LEG HE'D HAVE BEEN CHAMPION OF ENGLAND
8838-298546-0013 BROKE HIS LEG HAS HE YES AND IT SET BADLY THEY CA HIM OWD K BEHIND HIS BACK FOR THAT IS HOW HIS TWO LEGS LOOK BUT HIS ARMS WELL IF THEY WAS BOTH STROPPED TO A BENCH AS THE SAYIN IS
8838-298546-0014 I'LL TAKE THIS WITH ME SAID MONTGOMERY AND PUTTING THE PAPER INTO HIS POCKET HE RETURNED HOME IT WAS NOT A CHEERING RECORD WHICH HE READ THERE THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE CROXLEY MASTER WAS GIVEN IN FULL HIS MANY VICTORIES HIS FEW DEFEATS
8838-298546-0015 BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN SAID THE PROVINCIAL BIOGRAPHER SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN IN SPORTING CIRCLES AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY IS NOW IN HIS FORTIETH YEAR HANG IT I'M ONLY TWENTY THREE
8838-298546-0016 AND WON THE PROUD TITLE WHICH HE STILL HOLDS AMBITIOUS OF A MORE THAN LOCAL FAME HE SECURED A PATRON AND FOUGHT HIS FIRST FIGHT AGAINST JACK BARTON OF BIRMINGHAM IN MAY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AT THE OLD LOITERERS CLUB CRAGGS
8838-298546-0017 WHO FOUGHT AT TEN STONE TWO AT THE TIME HAD THE BETTER OF FIFTEEN RATTLING ROUNDS AND GAINED AN AWARD ON POINTS AGAINST THE MIDLANDER HAVING DISPOSED OF JAMES DUNN OF ROTHERHITHE CAMERON OF GLASGOW AND A YOUTH NAMED FERNIE
8838-298546-0018 IT WAS OWING TO THIS THAT HE WAS DEFEATED IN SEVEN ROUNDS BY WILLOX THE MAN WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEATEN AND AFTERWARDS BY JAMES SHAW OF LONDON THOUGH THE LATTER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD FOUND THE TOUGHEST CUSTOMER OF HIS CAREER UNDISMAYED BY HIS REVERSES
8838-298546-0019 THE MASTER ADAPTED THE STYLE OF HIS FIGHTING TO HIS PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND RESUMED HIS CAREER OF VICTORY DEFEATING NORTON THE BLACK HOBBY WILSON AND LEVI COHEN THE LATTER A HEAVY WEIGHT CONCEDING TWO STONE HE FOUGHT A DRAW WITH THE FAMOUS BILLY MC QUIRE
8838-298546-0020 WHO MAY WISH TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BAR ROOM SCRAMBLE AND A SCIENTIFIC CONTEST THE LATEST OF THESE AMBITIOUS SOULS COMES FROM THE WILSON COAL PITS WHICH HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO PUT UP A STAKE OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS AND BACK THEIR LOCAL CHAMPION
8838-298546-0021 THERE ARE VARIOUS RUMOURS AFLOAT AS TO WHO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS TO BE THE NAME OF TED BARTON BEING FREELY MENTIONED BUT THE BETTING WHICH IS SEVEN TO ONE ON THE MASTER AGAINST ANY UNTRIED MAN IS A FAIR REFLECTION OF THE FEELING OF THE COMMUNITY
8838-298546-0022 NO LIGHT MATTER THIS WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN NO BATTLE WITH A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHTER WHO PRESUMED UPON A LOCAL REPUTATION THE MAN'S RECORD SHOWED THAT HE WAS FIRST CLASS OR NEARLY SO THERE WERE A FEW POINTS IN HIS FAVOUR AND HE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEM
8838-298546-0023 THERE WAS AGE TWENTY THREE AGAINST FORTY THERE WAS AN OLD RING PROVERB THAT YOUTH WILL BE SERVED BUT THE ANNALS OF THE RING OFFER A GREAT NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS A HARD VETERAN FULL OF COOL VALOUR AND RING CRAFT
8838-298546-0024 COULD GIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND A BEATING TO MOST STRIPLINGS HE COULD NOT RELY TOO MUCH UPON HIS ADVANTAGE IN AGE BUT THEN THERE WAS THE LAMENESS THAT MUST SURELY COUNT FOR A GREAT DEAL AND LASTLY THERE WAS THE CHANCE THAT THE MASTER MIGHT UNDERRATE HIS OPPONENT
8838-298546-0025 THAT HE MIGHT BE REMISS IN HIS TRAINING AND REFUSE TO ABANDON HIS USUAL WAY OF LIFE IF HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD AN EASY TASK BEFORE HIM IN A MAN OF HIS AGE AND HABITS THIS SEEMED VERY POSSIBLE MONTGOMERY PRAYED THAT IT MIGHT BE SO
8838-298546-0026 MEANWHILE IF HIS OPPONENT WERE THE BEST MAN WHO EVER JUMPED THE ROPES INTO A RING HIS OWN DUTY WAS CLEAR HE MUST PREPARE HIMSELF CAREFULLY THROW AWAY NO CHANCE AND DO THE VERY BEST THAT HE COULD BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE WHICH EXISTS IN BOXING AS IN EVERY SPORT
8838-298546-0027 BETWEEN THE AMATEUR AND THE PROFESSIONAL THE COOLNESS THE POWER OF HITTING ABOVE ALL THE CAPABILITY OF TAKING PUNISHMENT COUNT FOR SO MUCH THOSE SPECIALLY DEVELOPED GUTTA PERCHA LIKE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES OF THE HARDENED PUGILIST
8838-298546-0028 WILL TAKE WITHOUT FLINCHING A BLOW WHICH WOULD LEAVE ANOTHER MAN WRITHING ON THE GROUND SUCH THINGS ARE NOT TO BE ACQUIRED IN A WEEK BUT ALL THAT COULD BE DONE IN A WEEK SHOULD BE DONE THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT HAD A GOOD BASIS TO START FROM
8838-298546-0029 TALL ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ON TWO LEGS AS THE OLD RING MEN USED TO SAY LITHE AND SPARE WITH THE ACTIVITY OF A PANTHER AND A STRENGTH WHICH HAD HARDLY YET EVER FOUND ITS LIMITATIONS HIS MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT WAS FINELY HARD
8838-298546-0030 BUT AS THE VISITING WAS DONE ON FOOT AND CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES HAD TO BE TRAVERSED IT WAS A TRAINING IN ITSELF FOR THE REST HE PUNCHED THE SWINGING BALL AND WORKED WITH THE DUMB BELLS FOR AN HOUR EVERY MORNING AND EVENING AND BOXED TWICE A DAY WITH TED BARTON IN THE GYMNASIUM
8838-298546-0031 GAINING AS MUCH PROFIT AS COULD BE GOT FROM A RUSHING TWO HANDED SLOGGER BARTON WAS FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS CLEVERNESS AND QUICKNESS BUT DOUBTFUL ABOUT HIS STRENGTH HARD HITTING WAS THE FEATURE OF HIS OWN STYLE AND HE EXACTED IT FROM OTHERS
8838-298546-0032 ALL THOT'S BETTER MON THOT'S FINE HE WOULD ADD AS HIS OPPONENT LIFTED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM ON THE END OF A RIGHT COUNTER THOT'S HOW I LIKES TO FEEL EM HAPPEN THOU'LT PULL THROUGH YET HE CHUCKLED WITH JOY WHEN MONTGOMERY KNOCKED HIM INTO A CORNER
8838-298546-0033 THESE CAUSELESS WHIMS AND FANCIES ARE VERY MUCH TO BE DEPRECATED MISTER MONTGOMERY CONSIDER HOW MANY THERE ARE TO WHOM THESE VERY POTATOES AND THIS VERY BEER WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE NO DOUBT SIR BUT AT PRESENT I PREFER TO DO WITHOUT THEM
8838-298546-0034 I SHOULD DO A DOUBLE DAY'S WORK ON FRIDAY SO AS TO LEAVE EVERYTHING IN ORDER I SHOULD HOPE TO BE BACK IN THE EVENING I AM AFRAID I CANNOT SPARE YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY THIS WAS A FACER IF HE COULD NOT GET LEAVE HE WOULD GO WITHOUT IT
8838-298546-0035 YOU WILL REMEMBER DOCTOR OLDACRE THAT WHEN I CAME TO YOU IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT I SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR DAY EVERY MONTH I HAVE NEVER CLAIMED ONE BUT NOW THERE ARE REASONS WHY I WISH TO HAVE A HOLIDAY UPON SATURDAY DOCTOR OLDACRE GAVE IN WITH A VERY BAD GRACE
8838-298546-0036 OF COURSE IF YOU INSIST UPON YOUR FORMAL RIGHTS THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID MISTER MONTGOMERY THOUGH I FEEL THAT IT SHOWS A CERTAIN INDIFFERENCE TO MY COMFORT AND THE WELFARE OF THE PRACTICE DO YOU STILL INSIST YES SIR VERY GOOD HAVE YOUR WAY
8838-298546-0037 A QUIET RESOLUTION IN HIS VOICE AS HE CLAIMED HIS SATURDAY WHICH AROUSED HIS CURIOSITY I HAVE NO DESIRE TO INTERFERE UNDULY WITH YOUR AFFAIRS MISTER MONTGOMERY BUT WERE YOU THINKING OF HAVING A DAY IN LEEDS UPON SATURDAY NO SIR
8838-298546-0038 IN THE COUNTRY YES SIR YOU ARE VERY WISE YOU WILL FIND A QUIET DAY AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS A VERY VALUABLE RESTORATIVE HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION I AM GOING OVER CROXLEY WAY
8838-298546-0039 A VERY INTERESTING RELIC OF THE EARLY NORMAN ERA BY THE WAY THERE IS ONE OBJECTION WHICH I SEE TO YOUR GOING TO CROXLEY ON SATURDAY IT IS UPON THAT DATE AS I AM INFORMED THAT THAT RUFFIANLY GLOVE FIGHT TAKES PLACE
8838-298546-0040 YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF MOLESTED BY THE BLACKGUARDS WHOM IT WILL ATTRACT I WILL TAKE MY CHANCE OF THAT SIR SAID THE ASSISTANT ON THE FRIDAY NIGHT WHICH WAS THE LAST NIGHT BEFORE THE FIGHT
8838-298546-0041 HE'S SIMPLY RIPPING SAID THE UNDERGRADUATE

8838-298546-0043 HE KEPT POKING HIS FINGER INTO MONTGOMERY AS IF HE WERE ONE OF HIS HORSES I HEAR THAT THE MASTER WILL SCALE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ODD AT THE RING SIDE BUT THERE'S SOME OF THAT WHICH HE'D LIKE WELL TO PULL OFF AND LEAVE BEHIND WI HIS SHIRT SAID PURVIS
8838-298546-0044 I HEAR THEY'VE HAD A RARE JOB TO GET HIM TO DROP HIS BEER AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT GREAT RED HEADED WENCH OF HIS

8838-298546-0046 THE DOOR OF THE GYMNASIUM HAD OPENED AND A LAD ABOUT SIXTEEN GRIMY AND BLACK WITH SOOT AND IRON STEPPED INTO THE YELLOW GLARE OF THE OIL LAMP TED BARTON SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR
