3830-12529-0000 A BEAUTIFUL PEBBLY BEACH EXTENDED ALMOST TO THE WATER'S EDGE EVEN AT LOW TIDE THERE WAS A GRASSY LEVEL SPIT A BACKGROUND OF EVERGREEN GIANT FIR TIMBER
3830-12529-0001 AND SUCH FUEL FOR THE CAMP FIRE BROKEN LIMBS WITH JUST ENOUGH PITCH TO MAKE A CHEERFUL BLAZE AND YET BODY ENOUGH TO LAST WELL
3830-12529-0002 GLAD THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED OLIVER WAS THE CARPENTER OF THE PARTY THE TENT BUILDER WOOD GETTER AND GENERAL ROUSTABOUT WHILE I THE JUNIOR WAS CHIEF COOK AND BOTTLE WASHER
3830-12529-0003 AN ENCAMPMENT OF INDIANS BEING NEAR A PARTY OF THEM SOON VISITED OUR CAMP AND BEGAN MAKING SIGNS FOR TRADE
3830-12529-0004 SAID ONE OF THE MATRONS OF THE PARTY WHAT DOES SHE SAY OLIVER I'M BLESSED IF I KNOW BUT IT LOOKS AS IF SHE WANTED TO SELL SOME CLAMS AFTER CONSIDERABLE DICKERING WITH SIGNS AND GESTURES AND WORDS MANY TIMES REPEATED
3830-12529-0005 WE WERE ABLE TO IMPART THE INFORMATION THAT WE WANTED
3830-12530-0000 SOON WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A FLEET OF SEVEN VESSELS LYING AT ANCHOR IN A LARGE BAY SEVERAL MILES IN EXTENT THE SIGHT OF THOSE SEVEN VESSELS LYING IN THE OFFING MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION UPON OUR MINDS
3830-12530-0001 WE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SO MANY SHIPS AT ONE PLACE CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AMONG THEM WAS THE GOOD BARK MARY MELVILLE WITH HER GRUFF MATE AND BIG HEARTED MASTER CAPTAIN BARSTON
3830-12530-0002 UPON THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE SHORES OF THIS BAY LAY THE TWO TOWNS PORT STEILACOOM AND STEILACOOM CITY BOTH ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE A FAR LARGER TRADE CENTERED HERE THAN AT ANY OTHER POINT ON PUGET SOUND
3830-12530-0003 AND WE DECIDED ON A HALT TO MAKE OURSELVES ACQUAINTED WITH THE SURROUNDINGS A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE SHORE WE FOUND ALSO FORT STEILACOOM IT WAS SIMPLY THE CAMP OF A COMPANY OF UNITED STATES SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN WOODEN SHELLS OF HOUSES
3830-12530-0004 AND LOG CABINS INTENSE RIVALRY RAN BETWEEN THE TWO TOWNS UPPER AND LOWER STEILACOOM AT THIS TIME AS A RESULT THINGS WERE BOOMING
3830-12530-0005 WE WERE SORELY TEMPTED TO ACCEPT THE FLATTERING OFFER OF FOUR DOLLARS A DAY FOR COMMON LABOR IN A TIMBER CAMP BUT CONCLUDED NOT TO BE SWERVED FROM THE SEARCH FOR A NEW HOMESITE DURING THIS VISIT WE BEGAN SEEING INDIANS IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS
3830-12530-0006 THEY SEEMED TO BE A LISTLESS LOT WITH NO THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE OR EVEN FOR THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT THE INDIANS IN THOSE DAYS SEEMED TO WORK OR PLAY BY SPURTS AND SPELLS HERE AND THERE WE SAW A FAMILY
3830-12530-0007 BUT AS A CLASS THEY SEEMED TO ME THE LAZIEST SET OF PEOPLE ON EARTH THAT OPINION WAS MATERIALLY MODIFIED LATER AS I BECAME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR HABITS I HAVE FOUND JUST AS INDUSTRIOUS PEOPLE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
3830-12530-0008 AMONG THE INDIANS AS AMONG THE WHITES THE WORKERS IT MAY BE SAID ARE LESS NUMEROUS AMONG THE MEN THE WOMEN ARE ALL INDUSTRIOUS SHOULD WE CAMP HERE AND SPY OUT THE LAND OR SHOULD WE GO FORWARD AND SEE WHAT LAY BEFORE US
3830-12530-0009 AFTER A SOBER SECOND THOUGHT WE REALIZED THAT WE HAD NOTHING TO TRADE BUT LABOR AND WE HAD NOT COME AS FAR AS THIS TO BE LABORERS FOR HIRE WE HAD COME TO FIND A PLACE TO MAKE A FARM
3830-12530-0010 AND A FARM WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AGAIN WE SET ABOUT SEARCHING FOR CLAIMS AND THE MORE WE SEARCHED THE LESS WE LIKED THE LOOK OF THINGS FINALLY ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER A LONG WEARISOME TRAMP WE CAST OFF AT HIGH TIDE
3830-12530-0011 AND IN A DEAD CALM TO CONTINUE OUR CRUISE OLIVER SOON DROPPED INTO A COMFORTABLE AFTERNOON NAP LEAVING ME IN FULL COMMAND AS THE SUN SHONE WARM AND THE TIDE WAS TAKING US RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION WE WANTED TO GO
3830-12530-0012 WHY SHOULDN'T I DOZE A LITTLE TOO EVEN IF WE DID MISS SOME OF THE SIGHTSEEING I WAS AROUSED FROM MY NAP BY OLIVER'S EXCLAIMING WHAT IS THAT THEN HALF TO HIMSELF AS I LIVE IT'S A DEER SWIMMING OUT HERE IN THE BAY
3830-12530-0013 IT SURELY CAN'T BE I RESPONDED THREE QUARTERS ASLEEP THAT'S WHAT IT IS HE ASSERTED WE WERE WIDE AWAKE NOW AND GAVE CHASE VERY SOON WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE ANIMAL AND SUCCEEDED IN THROWING A ROPE OVER ITS HORNS
3830-12530-0014 BY THIS TIME WE HAD DRIFTED INTO THE NARROWS AND WE SOON FOUND WE HAD SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAN TO TOW A DEER
3830-12530-0015 A PERPENDICULAR BLUFF ROSE FROM THE HIGHWATER MARK LEAVING NO PLACE FOR CAMP FIRE OR BED
3830-12530-0016 AND WITH CONTENDING FORCES OF CURRENTS AND COUNTER CURRENTS YET ALL MOVING IN A GENERAL DIRECTION IT WAS OUR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO A GENUINE TIDE RIP THE WATERS BOILED AS IF IN A VERITABLE CALDRON SWELLING UP HERE AND THERE
3830-12530-0017 GIVE ME THE SALMON CAUGHT BY TROLLING IN EARLY SUMMER IN THE DEEP WATERS OF PUGET SOUND THE FISH SO FAT THAT THE EXCESS OF OIL MUST BE TURNED OUT OF THE PAN WHILE COOKING
3830-12530-0018 THE FOLLOWING DAY WE COULD SEE MT RAINIER WITH ITS REFLECTION IN THE PLACID WATERS OF THE BAY THEODORE WINTHROP THE OBSERVANT TRAVELER WHO CAME INTO THESE SAME WATERS A FEW MONTHS LATER AND WROTE OF IT AS MT TACOMA
3830-12530-0019 DESCRIBED IT AS A GIANT MOUNTAIN DOME OF SNOW SEEMING TO FILL THE AERIAL SPACES AS THE IMAGE DISPLACED THE BLUE DEEPS OF TRANQUIL WATER A WONDROUS SIGHT IT WAS AND IS WHATEVER THE NAME NEXT DAY WE ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE PUYALLUP
3830-12530-0020 AND THAT THE CURRENT WAS VERY STRONG WE SECURED THE SERVICES OF AN INDIAN AND HIS CANOE TO HELP US UP THE RIVER AND LEFT OUR BOAT AT THE INDIANS CAMP NEAR THE MOUTH IT TOOK A TUGGING OF TWO DAYS TO GO SIX MILES
3830-12530-0021 AND DRAG OUR CANOE AROUND THE DRIFTS IT WAS A STORY OF CONSTANT TOIL WITH CONSEQUENT DISCOURAGEMENT NOT ENDING UNTIL WE CAMPED
3830-12530-0022 AN INDIAN TRAIL LED UP THE RIVER FROM
3830-12530-0023 BUT WAGON ROADS THERE WERE NONE AND WHETHER A FEASIBLE ROUTE FOR ONE COULD BE FOUND ONLY TIME AND LABOR COULD DETERMINE WE RETRACED OUR STEPS AND IN THE EVENING LANDED AGAIN AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AFTER A SEVERE DAY'S TOIL WE WERE IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD
3830-12530-0024 OLIVER DID NOT SING AS USUAL WHILE PREPARING FOR CAMP NEITHER DID I HAVE MUCH TO SAY BUT I FELL TO WORK MECHANICALLY PREPARING THE MUCH NEEDED MEAL WE ATE IN SILENCE AND THEN WENT TO SLEEP
3830-12530-0025 OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES OF UNOCCUPIED PRAIRIE LAND AS RICH AS ANYTHING THAT EVER LAY OUT OF DOORS ON OUR WAY FROM INDIANA TO OREGON IN SEARCH OF LAND ON WHICH TO MAKE A HOME HERE AT WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE END OF OUR ROPE
3830-12530-0026 WE HAD FOUND THE LAND BUT WITH CONDITIONS THAT SEEMED ALMOST TOO ADVERSE TO OVERCOME IT WAS A DISCOURAGING OUTLOOK EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ROADS SUCH TIMBER IT SEEMED AN APPALLING UNDERTAKING TO CLEAR THIS LAND
3830-12530-0027 WHEN WE FELL ASLEEP THAT NIGHT IT WAS WITHOUT VISIONS OF NEW FOUND WEALTH AND YET LATER I DID TACKLE A QUARTER SECTION OF THAT HEAVIEST TIMBER LAND AND NEVER LET UP UNTIL THE LAST TREE LOG STUMP AND ROOT HAD DISAPPEARED
3830-12530-0028 THOUGH OF COURSE NOT ALL CLEARED OFF BY MY OWN HANDS IF WE COULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS COMING FOUR MONTHS LATER WE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN SPITE OF OUR DISCOURAGEMENT
3830-12530-0029 PASS TRAIL INTO WASHINGTON THEY LOCATED IN A BODY OVER NEARLY THE WHOLE VALLEY AND BEFORE THE YEAR WAS ENDED HAD MADE A ROUGH WAGON ROAD OUT TO THE PRAIRIES
3830-12530-0030 LEST SOME SMART FELLOW SHOULD UP AND SAY I WAS DRAWING ON MY IMAGINATION I AM NOT WHEN WE HAD BROKEN CAMP AND WERE SAILING ALONG WE HEARD A DULL SOUND LIKE THAT OFTEN HEARD
3830-12530-0031 IT EXTENDED AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE IN THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING THE SOUND INCREASED AND BECAME LIKE THE ROAR OF A HEAVY FALL OF RAIN OR HAIL ON WATER AND WE BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS A VAST SCHOOL OF FISH MOVING SOUTH
3830-12530-0032 WHILE MILLIONS WERE SEEMINGLY DANCING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER OR LEAPING IN THE AIR WE COULD FEEL THE FISH STRIKING AGAINST THE BOAT IN SUCH VAST NUMBERS THAT THEY FAIRLY MOVED IT THE LEAP IN THE AIR WAS SO HIGH
3830-12530-0033 ONE WOULD DROP INTO THE BOAT WE SOON DISCOVERED SOME INDIANS FOLLOWING THE SCHOOL
3830-12530-0034 WITH AN IMPROVISED NET WE TOO SOON OBTAINED ALL WE WANTED WHEN WE BEGAN TO GO ON WE WERE EMBARRASSED BY THE MASS OF FISH MOVING IN THE WATER AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO END TO THE SCHOOL AHEAD OF US BUT WE FINALLY GOT CLEAR OF THE MOVING MASS
3830-12530-0035 AND REACHED THE ISLAND SHORE IN SAFETY ONLY TO BECOME WEATHER BOUND IN THE WILDS ONCE MORE THIS CAMP DID NOT PROVE SO DREARY AS THE LAST ONE ALTHOUGH IT WAS MORE EXPOSED TO THE SWELL OF THE BIG WATERS
3830-12530-0036 AND THE SWEEP OF THE WIND TO THE NORTH WE HAD A VIEW OF THIRTY MILES OR MORE TO WHERE HORIZON AND WATER BLENDED LEAVING IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER LAND WAS IN SIGHT OR NOT AS WE AFTERWARDS ASCERTAINED WE COULD SEE THE FAMOUS SAN JUAN ISLAND
3830-12530-0037 LATER THE BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AND GREAT BRITAIN WHEN THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS SETTLED PORT TOWNSEND LAY
3830-12530-0038 THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE TOWN LIKE THE LOST HUNTERS WE KNEW WHERE WE WERE BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ANY PLACE ELSE WAS NOT LOST OURSELVES THE WORLD WAS LOST FROM US THREE SHIPS PASSED US WHILE WE WERE AT THIS CAMP
3830-12530-0039 A MERE SPECK AND GROWING TO A FULL FLEDGED DEEP SEA VESSEL WITH ALL SAILS SET SCUDDING BEFORE THE WIND THE OTHER TWO WERE GRACEFULLY BEATING THEIR WAY OUT
3830-12530-0040 WITH THE BEAUTIFUL OPEN AND COMPARATIVELY LEVEL PLATEAU IN THE BACKGROUND AND TWO OR THREE VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN THE FOREGROUND MADE A PICTURE OF A PERFECT CITY SITE
3830-12530-0041 MANY SHACKS AND CAMPS AT FIRST MISTAKEN FOR THE WHITE MEN'S HOUSES WERE FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY NATIVES THEY WERE A DRUNKEN RASCALLY RABBLE SPENDING THEIR GAINS FROM THE SALE OF FISH AND OIL
3830-12530-0042 IN A DEBAUCH THAT WOULD LAST AS LONG AS THEIR MONEY HELD OUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A MORE STALWART RACE OF INDIANS THAN THOSE TO THE SOUTH DOUBTLESS FROM THE BUFFETING RECEIVED IN THE LARGER WATERS THEY WOULD OFTEN GO OUT EVEN TO THE OPEN SEA
3830-12530-0043 ON THEIR FISHING EXCURSIONS IN CANOES MANNED BY THIRTY MEN OR MORE AFTER SPENDING TWO OR THREE DAYS EXPLORING THE COUNTRY WE TURNED BACK TO THE BAY WHERE LAY THE SEVEN SHIPS WE HAD SEEN NEAR STEILACOOM WE REMEMBERED THE TIMBER CAMPS
3830-12530-0044 THE BUSTLE AND STIR OF THE LITTLE NEW VILLAGE AND THE ACTIVITY THAT WE SAW THERE GREATER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE WATERS OF THE SOUND MOST OF ALL MY THOUGHTS WOULD GO ON TO THE LITTLE CABIN ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER THREE DAYS SUFFICED TO LAND
3830-12530-0045 US BACK IN THE BAY WE SOUGHT BUT THE SHIPS WERE GONE NOT A SAILING CRAFT OF ANY KIND WAS IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE TOWN
3830-12531-0000 CAN I GET HOME TONIGHT I ASKED MYSELF IT WAS AN AFTERNOON OF THE LAST WEEK OF JUNE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND THE SUN WAS YET HIGH I WAS WELL UP THE LEFT BANK OF THE COWLITZ RIVER HOW FAR I COULD NOT TELL
3830-12531-0001 FOR THERE WERE NO MILESTONES ON THE CROOKED HALF OBSTRUCTED TRAIL LEADING DOWNSTREAM AT BEST IT WOULD BE A RACE WITH THE SUN BUT THE DAYS WERE LONG AND THE TWILIGHT WAS LONG
3830-12531-0002 I WORE A HEAVY WOOLEN SHIRT A SLOUCH HAT AND WORN SHOES BOTH HAT AND SHOES GAVE AMPLE VENTILATION SOCKS I HAD NONE NEITHER HAD I SUSPENDERS AN IMPROVISED BELT
3830-12531-0003 TAKING THEIR PLACE I WAS DRESSED FOR THE RACE AND WAS EAGER FOR THE TRIAL AT OLYMPIA I HAD PARTED WITH MY BROTHER
3830-12531-0004 WHILE I WAS TO GO HOME FOR THE WIFE AND BABY TO REMOVE THEM TO OUR NEW HOME I DID NOT PARTICULARLY MIND THE CAMPING BUT I DID NOT FANCY THE IDEA OF LYING OUT SO NEAR HOME IF BY EXTRA EXERTION I COULD REACH THE CABIN BEFORE NIGHT
3830-12531-0005 WE NEVER THOUGHT OF CATCHING COLD FROM LYING ON THE GROUND OR ON CEDAR BOUGHS OR FROM GETTING A GOOD DRENCHING AFTER ALL THE CABIN COULD NOT BE REACHED AS THE TRAIL COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED AT NIGHT
3830-12531-0006 SLACKENING PACE AT NIGHTFALL TO COOL MY SYSTEM GRADUALLY I FINALLY MADE MY CAMP AND SLEPT AS SOUNDLY AS IF ON A BED OF DOWN MY CONSOLATION WAS THAT THE NIGHT WAS SHORT AND I COULD SEE TO TRAVEL BY THREE O'CLOCK
3830-12531-0007 I DO NOT LOOK UPON THOSE YEARS OF CAMP AND CABIN LIFE AS YEARS OF HARDSHIP TO BE SURE OUR FOOD WAS PLAIN AS WELL AS OUR DRESS OUR HOURS OF LABOR WERE LONG AND THE LABOR ITSELF WAS FREQUENTLY SEVERE THE PIONEERS APPEARED ROUGH AND UNCOUTH
3830-12531-0008 WE NEVER WATCHED FOR THE SUN TO GO DOWN
3830-12531-0009 OR FOR THE BOSS TO QUICKEN OUR STEPS THE DAYS WERE ALWAYS TOO SHORT AND INTEREST IN OUR WORK WAS ALWAYS UNABATED THE CABIN COULD NOT BE SEEN UNTIL THE TRAIL CAME QUITE NEAR IT WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CURL OF SMOKE I KNEW I WAS ALMOST THERE THEN I SAW THE CABIN
3830-12531-0010 AND A LITTLE LADY IN ALMOST BLOOMER DRESS MILKING THE COW SHE NEVER FINISHED MILKING THAT COW NOR DID SHE EVER MILK ANY COW WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS AT HOME THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE COULD SCARCELY TELL WHERE TO BEGIN OR WHEN TO STOP
3830-12531-0011 MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY CENTERED ON THE QUESTION OF OUR MOVING TO A NEW HOME WHY AT OLYMPIA EGGS WERE A DOLLAR A DOZEN I SAW THEM SELLING AT THAT THE BUTTER YOU HAVE THERE WOULD BRING YOU A DOLLAR A POUND AS FAST AS YOU COULD WEIGH IT OUT
3830-12531-0012 I SAW STUFF THEY CALLED BUTTER SELL FOR THAT POTATOES ARE SELLING FOR THREE DOLLARS A BUSHEL AND ONIONS AT FOUR EVERYTHING THE FARMER RAISES SELLS HIGH WHO BUYS OH ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS TO BUY
3830-12531-0013 WHERE DO THEY GET THE MONEY EVERYBODY SEEMS TO HAVE MONEY SOME TAKE IT THERE WITH THEM MEN WORKING IN THE TIMBER CAMPS GET FOUR DOLLARS A DAY AND THEIR BOARD AT ONE PLACE THEY PAID FOUR DOLLARS A CORD FOR WOOD TO SHIP TO SAN FRANCISCO
3830-12531-0014 AND A MAN CAN SELL ALL THE SHINGLES HE CAN MAKE AT FOUR DOLLARS A THOUSAND I WAS OFFERED FIVE CENTS A FOOT FOR PILES IF WE HAD BUCK AND DANDY OVER THERE WE COULD MAKE TWENTY DOLLARS A DAY
3830-12531-0015 OFF THE GOVERNMENT LAND OF COURSE ALL HELP THEMSELVES TO WHAT THEY WANT THEN THERE ARE THE FISH AND THE CLAMS AND OYSTERS AND BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LAND FOR THE CLAIM THAT QUESTION WAS A STUMPER THE LITTLE WIFE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT BARGAIN MADE BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED
3830-12531-0016 NOW I FOUND MYSELF PRAISING A COUNTRY FOR THE AGRICULTURAL QUALITIES OF WHICH I COULD NOT SAY MUCH BUT IF WE COULD SELL PRODUCE HIGHER MIGHT WE NOT WELL LOWER OUR STANDARD OF AN IDEAL FARM THE CLAIM I HAD TAKEN WAS DESCRIBED WITH A TOUCH OF APOLOGY
3830-12531-0017 HOWEVER WE DECIDED TO MOVE AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR THE JOURNEY THE WIFE BABY BEDDING OX YOKE AND LOG CHAIN WERE SENT UP THE COWLITZ IN A CANOE BUCK AND DANDY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0018 ON THIS OCCASION I WAS ILL PREPARED FOR A COOL NIGHT CAMP HAVING NEITHER BLANKET NOR COAT I HAD EXPECTED TO REACH HARD BREAD'S HOTEL WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE CANOE WOULD STOP OVERNIGHT BUT I COULD NOT MAKE IT SO AGAIN I LAY OUT ON THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0019 HARD BREAD'S AN ODD NAME FOR A HOTEL WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE THE OLD WIDOWER THAT KEPT THE PLACE FED HIS PATRONS ON HARDTACK THREE TIMES A DAY I FOUND THAT MY WIFE HAD NOT FARED ANY BETTER THAN I HAD ON THE TRAIL AND IN FACT
3830-12531-0020 NOT SO WELL THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN THAT IS THE HOTEL WAS A GREAT DEAL HARDER THAN THE SAND SPIT WHERE I HAD PASSED THE NIGHT I HAD PLENTY OF PURE FRESH AIR WHILE SHE IN A CLOSED CABIN
3830-12531-0021 AND IN THE SAME ROOM WITH MANY OTHERS HAD NEITHER FRESH AIR NOR FREEDOM FROM CREEPING THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE MISERABLE WITH HER SHOES FOR A PILLOW A SHAWL FOR COVERING SMALL WONDER THAT SHE REPORTED I DID NOT SLEEP A WINK LAST NIGHT
3830-12531-0022 WE SOON ARRIVED AT THE COWLITZ LANDING THE END OF THE CANOE JOURNEY STRIKING THE TENT THAT HAD SERVED US SO WELL ON THE PLAINS AND MAKING A CHEERFUL CAMP FIRE WE SPEEDILY FORGOT THE HARD EXPERIENCES OF THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0023 FIFTY MILES MORE OF TRAVEL LAY BEFORE US AND SUCH A ROAD HOWEVER WE HAD ONE CONSOLATION IT WOULD BE WORSE IN WINTER THAN AT THAT TIME
3830-12531-0024 OUR COWS WERE GONE GIVEN FOR PROVENDER TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE OXEN DURING THE DEEP DECEMBER SNOW SO WHEN WE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK WE HAD THE BABY BUCK AND DANDY A TENT AN OX YOKE AND CHAIN ENOUGH CLOTHING AND BEDDING TO KEEP US COMFORTABLE
3830-12531-0025 A VERY LITTLE FOOD AND NO MONEY THE MONEY HAD ALL BEEN EXPENDED ON THE CANOE PASSAGE SHOULD WE PACK THE OXEN AND WALK
3830-12531-0026 THIS LAST PROPOSITION WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE AND SO NEXT MORNING DRIVING MY OXEN BEFORE ME AND LEAVING WIFE AND BABY TO TAKE CARE OF THE CAMP
3830-12531-0027 STRANGER THOUGH I WAS TO SAY YES YOU CAN HAVE TWO IF YOU NEED THEM JACKSON HAD SETTLED THERE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE
3830-12531-0028 THE DREAD DISEASE HAD TERRORS THEN THAT IT DOES NOT NOW POSSESS COULD IT BE POSSIBLE MY FOLKS HAD BEEN TAKEN SICK
3830-12531-0029 IT APPEARED THAT I HAD SCARCELY GOT OUT OF SIGHT ON MY TRIP BACK WITH THE OXEN BEFORE ONE OF THOSE ROYAL PIONEER MATRONS HAD COME TO THE CAMP SHE PLEADED AND INSISTED AND FINALLY ALMOST FRIGHTENED THE LITTLE WIFE INTO GOING WITH HER
3830-12531-0030 AND SHARING HER HOUSE WHICH WAS NEAR BY
3830-12531-0031 FINDING THAT THE BOAT AND PROVISIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN AND SEEING SMOKE IN THE BIGHT
3830-12535-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FINDING MY PEOPLE ON LEAVING MY NEWLY FOUND FRIENDS I FACED A DISCOURAGING PROSPECT THE START FOR THE HIGH ARID TABLE LANDS BORDERING THE YAKIMA VALLEY CUT ME LOOSE FROM ALL COMMUNICATION
3830-12535-0001 NO MORE IMMIGRANTS WERE MET UNTIL I REACHED THE MAIN TRAVELED ROUTE BEYOND THE COLUMBIA RIVER THE ROAD LAY THROUGH A FORBIDDING SAGE PLAIN OR RATHER AN UNDULATING COUNTRY COVERED BY SHIFTING SANDS
3830-12535-0002 AS THE SUN ROSE THE HEAT BECAME INTOLERABLE THE DUST IN PLACES BROUGHT VIVID MEMORIES OF THE TRIP ACROSS THE PLAINS
3830-12535-0003 TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE EXPECTED TRAIN
3830-12535-0004 AND COMPELLED ME TO LEAVE THE ROAD AND DESCEND INTO THE VALLEY FOR WATER
3830-12535-0005 THAT LASTED UNTIL DURING THE AFTERNOON WHEN I FOUND WATER ON THE TRAIL TETHERING MY PONY FOR HIS MUCH NEEDED DINNER I OPENED MY SACK OF HARD BREAD TO COUNT THE CONTENTS MY STORE WAS HALF GONE I LAY DOWN IN THE SHADE OF A SMALL TREE
3830-12535-0006 NEAR THE SPRING TO TAKE AN AFTERNOON NAP ROUSING BEFORE SUNDOWN REFRESHED BOBBY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL WITH NEW COURAGE WHEN NIGHT CAME I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO CAMP THE COOL OF THE EVENING INVIGORATED THE PONY AND WE PUSHED ON
3830-12535-0007 FINDING THAT THE ROAD COULD BE FOLLOWED THOUGH BUT DIMLY SEEN I KEPT ON THE TRAIL UNTIL A LATE HOUR WHEN I UNSADDLED AND HOBBLED THE PONY THE SADDLE BLANKET WAS BROUGHT INTO USE AND I WAS SOON OFF IN DREAMLAND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE DUST THE TRAIL OR THE MORROW
3830-12535-0008 TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HIS HOBBLES HAD BECOME LOOSENED GIVING HIM FREE USE OF ALL HIS FEET AND HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO TAKE THE TRAIL AGAIN COAXING WAS OF NO AVAIL DRIVING WOULD DO NO GOOD
3830-12535-0009 I FOLLOWED HIM AROUND ABOUT OVER THE PLAIN AND THROUGH THE SAGE BRUSH AT A RAPID GAIT FINALLY HE SLACKENED PACE AND I AGAIN BECAME MASTER
3830-12535-0010 ALL THIS ROAMING OVER THE PLAIN AT BOBBY'S HEELS BUT I HAPPENED TO TAKE THE RIGHT COURSE WHEN THE TRAIL WAS FOUND THERE WAS THE SADDLE TO LOOK FOR AND THIS WAS LOCATED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
3830-12535-0011 A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF TRAVEL BROUGHT UNEASINESS AS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE NOT ON THE REGULAR TRAIL NOT KNOWING BUT THIS WAS SOME CUT OFF I WENT ON UNTIL THE COLUMBIA RIVER BLUFF WAS REACHED AND THE GREAT RIVER WAS IN SIGHT
3830-12535-0012 HALF A MILE DISTANT AND SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET LOWER TAKING A TRAIL DOWN THE BLUFF THAT SEEMED MORE PROMISING THAN THE WAGON TRACKS I BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR THE ROAD AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF
3830-12535-0013 ONLY TO FIND EVERY SEMBLANCE OF A ROAD GONE I LOST MORE THAN A HALF DAY'S PRECIOUS TIME AND AGAIN WAS THROWN INTO ANXIETY LEST I HAD MISSED THE LONG SOUGHT TRAIN THE NEXT INCIDENT THAT I REMEMBER VIVIDLY WAS MY ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE COLUMBIA
3830-12535-0014 JUST BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE SNAKE RIVER I HAD SEEN BUT FEW INDIANS ON THE WHOLE TRIP AND IN FACT THE CAMP I FOUND THERE ON THE BANK OF THE GREAT RIVER WAS THE FIRST I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER COMING UPON I COULD NOT INDUCE THE INDIANS TO CROSS ME OVER
3830-12535-0015 THEY SEEMED SURLY AND UNFRIENDLY THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS SO IN CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE INDIANS ON THE SOUND THAT I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT IT MEANT NO ONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE LOST HIS LIFE AT THE HANDS OF THE INDIANS THAT SEASON
3830-12535-0016 UNTIL I WAS HOARSE FROM THE VIOLENT EFFORT FINALLY WHILE SITTING THERE WONDERING WHAT TO DO I SPIED A BLUE SMOKE ARISING FROM A CABIN ON THE OTHER SIDE SOON AFTER I SAW A MAN HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO MY RENEWED EFFORTS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
3830-12535-0017 THE TROUBLE HAD BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ALL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY MORNING EXPENDING MY BREATH FOR NOTHING THE MAN WAS SHIRLEY ENSIGN OF OLYMPIA WHO HAD ESTABLISHED A FERRY ACROSS THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND HAD LINGERED TO SET OVER BELATED IMMIGRANTS IF ANY SHOULD COME ALONG
3830-12535-0018 AND HAD MET MY PEOPLE THEY WERE CAMPED SOME THIRTY MILES AWAY HE THOUGHT
3830-12535-0019 BUT I COULD NOT WAIT THERE FOR THEM
3830-12535-0020 DETERMINED TO REACH CAMP THAT NIGHT IF I COULD POSSIBLY DO SO
3830-12535-0021 DUSK CAME ON AND STILL NO SIGNS THEN I SPIED SOME CATTLE GRAZING ON THE UPLAND AND SOON CAME UPON THE CAMP IN A RAVINE THAT HAD SHUT IT FROM VIEW REJOICING AND OUTBURSTS OF GRIEF FOLLOWED I INQUIRED FOR MY MOTHER THE FIRST THING
3830-12535-0022 SHE WAS NOT THERE MONTHS BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE SANDS OF THE PLATTE VALLEY MY YOUNGER BROTHER ALSO LAY BURIED ON THE PLAINS NEAR INDEPENDENCE ROCK
3830-12535-0023 WHEN WE CAME TO CONSIDER HOW THE PARTY SHOULD PROCEED I ADVISED THE OVER MOUNTAIN TRIP BUT I CAUTIONED THEM TO EXPECT SOME SNOW AND MUCH HARD WORK HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE THEY ASKED ABOUT THREE WEEKS THIS BROUGHT DISAPPOINTMENT
3830-12535-0024 THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THROUGH WITH THE JOURNEY YOU CAME TO STAY WITH US DIDN'T YOU I WANT TO BUT WHAT ABOUT MY WIFE AND THE TWO BABIES AT THE ISLAND FATHER SAID SOME ONE MUST GO AND LOOK AFTER THEM SO OLIVER WAS SENT AHEAD
3830-12535-0025 WHILE I WAS TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND HELP THE IMMIGRANTS THROUGH THE NATCHESS PASS IN OUR TRAIN WERE FIFTY OR MORE HEAD OF STOCK SEVEN WAGONS AND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE WE MADE THE TRIP ACROSS THE DIVIDE IN TWENTY TWO DAYS WITHOUT SERIOUS MISHAP OR LOSS
3830-12535-0026 THAT BESET OUR WAY AT EVERY STEP EVERY MAN LITERALLY PUT HIS SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL WE WERE COMPELLED OFTEN TO TAKE HOLD OF THE WHEELS TO BOOST THE WAGONS OVER THE LOGS OR TO EASE THEM DOWN STEEP PLACES
3830-12535-0027 ONE MAN TO EACH WAGON TO DRIVE FOUR TO ACT AS WHEELMEN FATHER AND THE WOMEN ON FOOT OR HORSEBACK TO DRIVE THE STOCK GOD BLESS THE WOMEN FOLKS OF THE PLAINS NOBLER BRAVER MORE UNCOMPLAINING SOULS WERE NEVER KNOWN
3830-12535-0028 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME ONE OUGHT TO WRITE A JUST TRIBUTE TO THEIR VALOR AND PATIENCE A BOOK OF THEIR HEROIC DEEDS ONE DAY WE ENCOUNTERED A NEWLY FALLEN TREE COCKED UP ON ITS OWN UPTURNED ROOTS FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND GO AROUND IT WE COULD NOT
3830-12535-0029 TO CUT IT OUT WITH OUR DULLED FLIMSY SAW SEEMED AN ENDLESS TASK DIG DOWN BOYS SAID FATHER AND IN SHORT ORDER EVERY AVAILABLE SHOVEL WAS OUT OF THE WAGONS VERY SOON THE WAY WAS OPEN FULLY FOUR FEET DEEP AND OXEN AND WAGONS PASSED UNDER THE OBSTRUCTION
3830-12535-0030 DO YOU SAY THAT WE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIPS THAT DEPENDS UPON THE POINT OF VIEW AS TO THIS RETURN TRIP I CAN TRULY SAY FOR MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT ONE OF HARDSHIP I ENJOYED OVERCOMING THE DIFFICULTIES AND SO DID THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE COMPANY
3830-12535-0031 BUT BETTER FOOD WAS OBTAINABLE AND THE GOAL WAS NEAR AT HAND IT WAS A POSITIVE PLEASURE THEREFORE TO PASS OVER THE MILES ONE BY ONE
3830-12535-0032 WHEN OUR LITTLE TRAIN AT LAST EMERGED FROM THE FORESTS AND CAME OUT INTO THE NISQUALLY PLAINS
3830-12535-0033 SO MARKED WAS THE CONTRAST HUNDREDS OF CATTLE SHEEP AND HORSES WERE QUIETLY GRAZING SCATTERED OVER THE LANDSCAPE AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE
