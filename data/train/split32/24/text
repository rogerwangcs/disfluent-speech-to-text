7226-86964-0000 WE WERE SOMEWHAT JADED BY THE TIME MONDAY MORNING CAME FOR SUNDAY BROUGHT NOT ONLY NO RELIEF BUT REPETITIONS OF MANY OF THE MOST HORRIBLE OF THESE TALES OF A WAYSIDE INN
7226-86964-0001 IT WAS WITH NO SLIGHT SENSE OF RELIEF THAT WE PAID OUR MODEST BILL AND AT LAST BROKE AWAY FROM SUCH GHASTLY ASSOCIATIONS AN INVOLUNTARY SHUDDER OVERCAME ME AS WE PASSED THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND
7226-86964-0002 AT THE FOOT OF OUR HOST'S ORCHARD WHICH HE HAD DESCRIBED AS A CATCH BASIN FOR HUMAN FLOATERS OUR COURSE STILL LAY AMONG LARGE DENSELY WOODED ISLANDS MANY OF THEM WHOLLY GIVEN UP TO MAPLES AND WILLOWS
7226-86964-0003 AND DEEP CUTS THROUGH SUN BAKED MUDBANKS THE COLOR OF ADOBE BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE LOW GLOOMY BOTTOMS HEAVILY FORESTED AND STREWN WITH FLOOD WOOD WHILE BEYOND THE LAND RISES GRADUALLY INTO PRAIRIE STRETCHES
7226-86964-0004 IN THE BOTTOMS THE TREES ARE FILLED WITH FLOCKS OF BIRDS CROWS HAWKS BLACKBIRDS WITH STATELY BLUE HERONS AND AGILE PLOVERS FORAGING ON THE LONG GRAVEL SPITS WHICH FREQUENTLY JUT FAR INTO THE STREAM
7226-86964-0005 DUCKS ARE FREQUENTLY SEEN SAILING NEAR THE SHORES WHILE DIVERS SILENTLY DART AND PLUNGE AHEAD OF THE CANOE SAFELY OUT OF GUNSHOT REACH A HEAD WIND THIS MORNING MADE ROWING MORE DIFFICULT BY COUNTERACTING THE INFLUENCE OF THE CURRENT
7226-86964-0006 WE WERE AT LYNDON AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THERE IS A POPULATION OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED CLUSTERED AROUND A RED PAPER MILL THE LATTER MADE A PRETTY PICTURE STANDING OUT ON THE BOLD BANK BACKED BY A NUMBER OF HUGE STACKS OF GOLDEN STRAW
7226-86964-0007 WE MET HERE THE FIRST RAPIDS WORTHY OF RECORD ALSO AN OLD ABANDONED MILL DAM IN THE LAST STAGES OF DECAY STRETCHING ITS WHITENED SKELETON ACROSS THE STREAM A HARBOR FOR DRIFTWOOD
7226-86964-0008 NEAR THE SOUTH BANK THE FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN ENTIRELY SWEPT AWAY FOR A SPACE SEVERAL RODS IN WIDTH AND THROUGH THIS OPENING THE PENT UP CURRENT FIERCELY SWEEPS WE WENT THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE CHANNEL THUS MADE WITH A SWOOP
7226-86964-0009 THAT GAVE US AN IMPETUS WHICH SOON CARRIED OUR VESSEL OUT OF SIGHT OF LYNDON AND ITS PAPER MILL AND STRAW STACKS PROPHETSTOWN FIVE MILES BELOW IS PRETTILY SITUATED IN AN OAK GROVE ON THE SOUTHERN BANK
7226-86964-0010 ONLY THE GABLES OF A FEW HOUSES CAN BE SEEN FROM THE RIVER WHOSE BANKS OF YELLOW CLAY AND BROWN MUD ARE HERE TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH DURING THE FIRST THIRD OF THE PRESENT CENTURY THIS PLACE WAS THE SITE OF A WINNEBAGO VILLAGE WHOSE CHIEF
7226-86964-0011 WAS WHITE CLOUD A SHREWD SINISTER SAVAGE HALF WINNEBAGO AND HALF SAC WHO CLAIMED TO BE A PROPHET HE WAS BLACK HAWK'S EVIL GENIUS DURING THE UPRISING OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO AND IN MANY WAYS
7226-86964-0012 WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE ABORIGINES KNOWN TO ILLINOIS HISTORY IT WAS AT THE PROPHET'S TOWN AS WHITE CLOUD'S VILLAGE WAS KNOWN IN PIONEER DAYS THAT BLACK HAWK RESTED UPON HIS ILL FATED JOURNEY UP THE ROCK AND FROM HERE
7226-86964-0013 AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE WIZARD HE BADE THE UNITED STATES SOLDIERY DEFIANCE THERE ARE RAPIDS ALMOST CONTINUALLY FROM A MILE ABOVE PROPHETSTOWN TO ERIE TEN MILES BELOW THE RIVER BED HERE HAS A SHARPER DESCENT THAN CUSTOMARY
7226-86964-0014 AND IS THICKLY STREWN WITH BOWLDERS MANY OF THEM WERE VISIBLE ABOVE THE SURFACE AT THE LOW STAGE OF WATER WHICH WE FOUND BUT FOR THE GREATER PART THEY WERE COVERED FOR TWO OR THREE INCHES WHAT WITH THESE IMPEDIMENTS
7226-86964-0015 THE SNAGS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT AS THE LEGACY OF LAST SPRING'S FLOOD AND THE FREQUENT SAND BANKS AND GRAVEL SPITS NAVIGATION WAS ATTENDED BY MANY DIFFICULTIES AND SOME DANGERS FOUR OR FIVE MILES BELOW PROPHETSTOWN
7226-86964-0016 A LONE FISHERMAN ENGAGED IN EXAMINING A TRAUT LINE STRETCHED BETWEEN ONE OF THE NUMEROUS GLOOMY ISLANDS AND THE MAINLAND KINDLY INFORMED US OF A MILE LONG CUT OFF THE MOUTH OF WHICH WAS NOW IN VIEW THAT WOULD SAVE US SEVERAL MILES OF ROWING
7226-86964-0017 HERE THE HIGH BANKS HAD RECEDED WITH SEVERAL MILES OF HEAVILY WOODED BOGGY BOTTOMS INTERVENING FLOODS HAD HELD HIGH CARNIVAL AND THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY WAS WILD AND DESERTED THE CUT OFF WAS AN UGLY LOOKING CHANNEL
7226-86964-0018 BUT WHERE OUR INFORMANT HAD GONE THROUGH WITH HIS UNWIELDY HULK WE CONSIDERED IT SAFE TO VENTURE WITH A CANOE SO READILY RESPONSIVE TO THE SLIGHTEST PADDLE STROKE
7226-86964-0019 IT WAS A SCENE OF HOWLING DESOLATION RACK AND RUIN UPON EVERY HAND THE MUDDY TORRENT AT A VELOCITY OF FULLY EIGHT MILES AN HOUR WENT EDDYING AND WHIRLING AND DARTING AND ROARING AMONG THE GNARLED AND BLACKENED STUMPS THE PROSTRATE TREES
7226-86964-0020 THE TWISTED ROOTS THE HUGE BOWLDERS WHICH STUDDED ITS COURSE THE STREAM WAS NOT WIDE ENOUGH FOR THE OARS THE PADDLE WAS THE SOLE RELIANCE WITH EYES STRAINED FOR OBSTRUCTIONS WE TURNED AND TWISTED THROUGH THE LABYRINTH
7226-86964-0021 JUMPING ALONG AT A BREAKNECK SPEED AND WHEN WE FINALLY REJOINED THE MAIN RIVER BELOW WERE GRATEFUL ENOUGH FOR THE RUN HAD BEEN FILLED WITH CONTINUOUS POSSIBILITIES OF A DISASTROUS SMASH UP MILES AWAY FROM ANY HUMAN HABITATION
7226-86964-0022 THE THUNDER STORM WHICH HAD BEEN THREATENING SINCE EARLY MORNING SOON BURST UPON US WITH A PRELIMINARY WIND BLAST FOLLOWED BY DRENCHING RAIN RUNNING ASHORE ON THE LEE BANK WE WRAPPED THE CANVAS AWNING AROUND THE BAGGAGE
7226-86964-0023 AND MADE FOR A THICK CLUMP OF TREES ON THE TOP OF AN ISLAND MUDBANK WHERE WE STOOD BUTTONED TO THE NECK IN RUBBER COATS A VIGOROUS HALLOO CAME SOUNDING OVER THE WATER LOOKING UP WE SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME A SMALL TENT ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE
7226-86964-0024 A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY IN FRONT OF WHICH WAS A MAN SHOUTING TO US AND BECKONING US OVER IT WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY MUDDY UNDER THE TREES WHICH HAD NOT LONG SUFFICED AS AN UMBRELLA AND THE RUBBER COATS WERE NOT WARRANTED TO WITHSTAND A DELUGE
7226-86964-0025 SO WE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WITH ALACRITY AND PADDLED OVER THROUGH THE PELTING STORM OUR HOST WAS A YOUNG FISHERMAN WHO HELPED US AND OUR LUGGAGE UP THE SLIMY BANK TO HIS CANVAS QUARTERS WHICH WE FOUND TO BE DRY ALTHOUGH ODOROUS OF FISH
7226-86964-0026 WHILE THE STORM RAGED WITHOUT THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS A SIMPLE HEARTED FELLOW CONFIDED TO US THE DETAILS OF HIS BRIEF CAREER HE HAD BEEN MARRIED BUT A YEAR HE SAID HIS LITTLE CABIN LAY A QUARTER OF A MILE BACK IN THE WOODS
7226-86964-0027 AND SO AS TO BE CONVENIENT TO HIS LINES HE WAS CAMPING ON HIS OWN WOOD LOT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT IN FISHING OR HUNTING ACCORDING TO THE SEASON AND PEDDLING THE PRODUCT IN NEIGHBORING TOWNS
7226-86964-0028 WHICH HAD RECENTLY BECOME ENRICHED BY THE ADDITION OF AN INFANT SON THE PHENOMENAL POWERS OF OBSERVATION DISPLAYED BY THIS FIRST BORN YOUTH WERE REPORTED WITH MUCH DETAIL BY THE FOND FATHER WHO SAT CROUCHED UPON A BOAT SAIL IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE TENT
7226-86964-0029 HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND SMOKING VILE TOBACCO IN A BLACKENED CLAY PIPE IT SEEMED THAT HIS WIFE WAS A FERRYMAN'S DAUGHTER AND HER FATHER HAD BESOUGHT HIS SON IN LAW TO FOLLOW THE SAME STEADY CALLING TO BE SURE OUR HOST DECLARED FERRIES ON THE ROCK RIVER NETTED THEIR OWNERS
7226-86964-0030 WHICH HE CONSIDERED A GOODLY SUM AND HIS FATHER IN LAW HAD OFFERED TO PURCHASE AN ESTABLISHED PLANT FOR HIM BUT THE YOUNG FELLOW SAID THAT FERRYING WAS A DOG'S LIFE AND KEPT A FELLER HOME LIKE BARN CHORES
7226-86964-0031 SO REJECTED THE OFFER AND SETTLED DOWN AVOWEDLY FOR LIFE IN HIS PRESENT PRECARIOUS OCCUPATION AS A RESULT THE INDIGNANT OLD MAN HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO AGAIN ENTER THE PARENTAL FERRY HOUSE UNTIL HE AGREED TO ACCEPT HIS PROPOSALS
7226-86964-0032 AND THERE WAS HENCEFORTH TO BE A STANDING FAMILY QUARREL THE FISHERMAN HAVING APPEALED TO MY JUDGMENT I ENDEAVORED WITH MILD CAUTION TO ARGUE HIM OUT OF HIS POSITION ON THE SCORE OF CONSIDERATION FOR HIS WIFE AND LITTLE ONE
7226-86964-0033 AND FIRMLY THOUGH WITH ADMIRABLE GOOD NATURE PERSISTED IN DEFENDING HIS ROVING TENDENCIES IN THE COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION I LEARNED THAT THE FERRYMEN WHO ARE MORE NUMEROUS ON THE LOWER THAN ON THE UPPER ROCK PAY AN ANNUAL LICENSE FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS EACH
7226-86964-0034 IN CONSIDERATION OF WHICH THEY ARE GUARANTIED A MONOPOLY OF THE BUSINESS AT THEIR STANDS NO OTHER LINE BEING ALLOWED WITHIN ONE MILE OF AN EXISTING FERRY WITHIN AN HOUR AND A HALF THE STORM HAD APPARENTLY PASSED OVER AND WE CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY
7226-86964-0035 BUT AFTER SUPPER ANOTHER SHOWER AND A STIFF HEAD WIND CAME UP AND WE WERE WELL BEDRAGGLED BY THE TIME A FERRY LANDING NEAR THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF ERIE WAS REACHED THE BOTTOMS ARE HERE A MILE OR TWO IN WIDTH WITH OCCASIONAL OPENINGS IN THE WOODS
7226-86964-0036 WHERE SMALL FIELDS ARE CULTIVATED BY THE POORER CLASS OF FARMERS WHO WERE LAST SPRING MUCH DAMAGED BY THE FLOOD WHICH SWEPT THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY THE FERRYMAN A GOOD NATURED YOUNG ATHLETE
7226-86964-0037 WAS LANDING A FARM WAGON AND TEAM AS WE PULLED IN UPON THE MUDDY ROADWAY WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT QUARTERS HE SMILED AND POINTING TO HIS LITTLE CABIN A FEW RODS OFF IN THE BUSHES SAID WE'VE FOUR PEOPLE TO SLEEP IN TWO ROOMS
7226-86964-0038 IT'S SURE WE CAN'T TAKE YE I'D LIKE TO OTHERWISE BUT ERIE'S ONLY A MILE AWAY WE ASSURED HIM THAT WITH THESE MUDDY SWAMP ROADS AND IN OUR WET CONDITION NOTHING BUT ABSOLUTE NECESSITY WOULD INDUCE US TO TAKE A MILE'S TRAMP THE PARLEY
7226-86964-0039 ENDED IN OUR BEING DIRECTED TO A SMALL FARM HOUSE A QUARTER OF A MILE INLAND WHERE LUCKLESS TRAVELERS BELATED ON THE DREARY BOTTOMS WERE OCCASIONALLY KEPT MAKING THE CANOE FAST FOR THE NIGHT WE STRUNG OUR BAGGAGE PACKS UPON THE PADDLE WHICH WE CARRIED BETWEEN US
7226-86964-0040 AND SET OUT ALONG A DEVIOUS WAY THROUGH A DRIVING MIST WHICH BLACKENED THE TWILIGHT INTO DUSK TO FIND THIS PLACE OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT IT IS A LITTLE ONE STORY DILAPIDATED FARM HOUSE
7226-86964-0041 STANDING A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE COUNTRY ROAD AMID A CLUMP OF POPLAR TREES FORCING OUR WAY THROUGH THE HINGELESS GATE THE VIOLENT REMOVAL OF WHICH THREATENED THE IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION OF SEVERAL LENGTHS OF RICKETY FENCE
7226-86964-0042 WE WALKED UP TO THE OPEN FRONT DOOR AND APPLIED FOR SHELTER YES MA'AM WE SOMETIMES KEEPS TAVERN MA'AM REPLIED A LARGE GREASY LOOKING BLACK HAIRED WOMAN OF SOME FORTY YEARS
7226-86964-0043 AS HER HANDS FOLDED WITHIN HER UP TURNED APRON SHE COURTESIED TO W WE WERE AT ONCE SHOWN INTO A FROWSY APARTMENT WHICH SERVED AS PARLOR SITTING ROOM AND PARENTAL DORMITORY
7226-86964-0044 AND CHEAP DECORATIONS PECULIAR IN THE COUNTRY TO ALL THREE CLASSES OF ROOMS THE EVIDENCES OF POVERTY SHIFTLESSNESS AND UNTASTEFUL PRETENTIOUSNESS UPON EVERY SIDE
7226-86964-0045 A HUGE WHEEZY OLD CABINET ORGAN WAS SET DIAGONALLY IN ONE CORNER AND UPON THIS AS WE ENTERED A YOUNG WOMAN WAS POUNDING AND PADDLING WITH MUCH VIGOR WHILE GIVING US SIDELONG GLANCES OF CURIOSITY
7226-86964-0046 SHE WAS A NEIGHBOR ON AN EVENING VISIT DECKED OUT IN A SMART JOCKEY CAP WITH A GREEN OSTRICH TIP AND BRIGHT BLUE RIBBONS AND GAY IN A NEW CALICO DRESS
7226-86964-0047 A YELLOW FIELD THICKLY PLANTED TO PURPLE PINEAPPLES A JAUNTY FORWARD CREATURE IN PIMPLES AND CURLS SHE RATTLED AWAY THROUGH A MOODY AND SANKEY HYMN BOOK THE WHEEZES AND GROANS OF THE ANTIQUE INSTRUMENT
7226-86964-0048 COMING IN LIKE MOURNFUL EJACULATIONS FROM THE AMEN CORNER AT A SUCCESSFUL REVIVAL HAVING EXHAUSTED HER STOCK OF TUNES SHE WHEELED AROUND UPON HER STOOL AND AFTER DECLARING TO HER HALF DOZEN ADMIRING AUDITORS THAT HER HANDS
7226-86964-0049 WERE AS TIRED AS AFTER THE MORNIN'S MILKIN ABRUPTLY ACCOSTED W MA'AM KIN YE PLAY ON THE ORGIN W CONFESSED HER INABILITY CHIEFLY FROM LACK OF PRACTICE IN THE ART OF INCESSANTLY WORKING THE PEDALS
7226-86964-0050 THAT'S THE TRICK O THE HUL BUSINESS MA'AM IS THE BLOWIN IT'S ALL IN GETTIN THE BELLERS TO WORK EVEN LIKE THERE'S A GOOD MANY WHAT KIN LEARN THE PLAYIN PART OF IT WITHOUT NO TEACHER BUT THERE HAS TO BE LESSONS TO LEARN THE BELLERS
7226-86964-0051 W MODESTLY CONFESSED TO NEVER HAVING POSSESSED SUCH AN INSTRUMENT DOWN IN THESE PARTS REJOINED THE YOUNG WOMAN AS SHE WORKED THE BELLERS INTO A STRAIN OR TWO OF HOLD THE FORT APPARENTLY TO SHOW HOW EASY IT CAME TO TRAINED FEET
7226-86964-0052 NO HOUSE IS NOW CONSIDERED QUITE UP TO THE FASHI'N AS AIN'T GOT A ORGIN THE RAIN BEING NOW OVER SHE SOON DEPARTED
7226-86964-0053 THE BED CHAMBER INTO WHICH WE WERE SHOWN WAS A MARVEL IT OPENED OFF THE MAIN ROOM AND WAS DOUBTLESS ORIGINALLY A CUPBOARD SEVEN FEET SQUARE WITH A BROAD ROPED BEDSTEAD OCCUPYING THE ENTIRE LENGTH
7226-86964-0054 NECESSITATING THE USE OF THE BED AS A DRESSING PLACE AFTER THE FASHION OF A SLEEPING CAR BUNK THIS CUBBY HOLE OF A ROOM WAS ALSO THE WARDROBE FOR THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD THE WALLS ABOVE THE BED BEING HUNG NEARLY TWO FEET DEEP
7226-86964-0055 WITH THE ODDEST COLLECTION OF CALICO AND GINGHAM GOWNS BUSTLES HOOPSKIRTS HATS BONNETS AND WINTER UNDERWEAR I THINK I HAD EVER LAID EYES ON MUCH OF THIS CONDITION OF AFFAIRS WAS NOT KNOWN HOWEVER UNTIL NEXT MORNING
7226-86964-0056 FOR IT WAS AS DARK AS EGYPT WITHIN EXCEPT FOR A FEW FAINT RAYS OF LIGHT WHICH CAME STRAGGLING THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THE BOARD PARTITION SEPARATING US FROM THE SITTING ROOM CANDLE WE HAD NO SOONER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF OUR LITTLE BOX
7226-86964-0057 THAN THE CREAKY OLD CLEAT DOOR WAS GENTLY CLOSED UPON US AND BUTTONED BY OUR HOSTESS UPON THE OUTSIDE AS THE ONLY MEANS OF KEEPING IT SHUT AND WE WERE LEFT FREE TO GROPE ABOUT AMONG THESE MYSTERIES AS BEST WE MIGHT
7226-86964-0058 WE HAD HARDLY RECOVERED FROM OUR ASTONISHMENT AT THUS BEING LOCKED INTO A DARK HOLE THE SIZE OF A FASHIONABLE LADY'S TRUNK AND WERE QUIETLY LAUGHING OVER THIS ODD ADVENTURE WHEN THE LANDLADY APPLIED HER MOUTH TO A CRACK AND SHOUTED AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE WAKED THE DEAD HI THERE
7226-86964-0059 A FEW MINUTES LATER RETURNING TO THE CRACK SHE ADDED
7226-86964-0060 REPRESSING OUR MIRTH WE ASSURED OUR GOOD HOSTESS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A DUE REGARD FOR OUR PERSONAL SAFETY
7226-86965-0000 WE HAD BREAKFAST IN THE TAVERN KITCHEN
7226-86965-0001 WAS A SHORT SMOOTH FACED VOLUBLE OVERGROWN BOY SORT OF MAN THE MOTHER WAS DUMPY COARSE AND GOOD NATURED THEY HAD A GREASY EASY TEMPERED DAUGHTER OF EIGHTEEN WITH A FROWSY HEAD AND A FACE LIKE A FULL MOON
7226-86965-0002 WHILE THE HEIR OF THE HOUSEHOLD SOMEWHAT YOUNGER WAS A GAPING GRINNING YOUTH OF THE SIMPLE SIMON ORDER WHO SHOVELLED MASHED POTATOES INTO HIS MOUTH ALTERNATELY WITH KNIFE AND FORK AND TOOK BITES OF BREAD LARGE ENOUGH FOR A RAVENOUS DOG
7226-86965-0003 THE OLD GRANDMOTHER WITH A FACE LIKE PARCHMENT AND ONE GLEAMING EYE SAT IN A LOW ROCKING CHAIR BY THE STOVE CROONING OVER A CORN COB PIPE AND USING THE WOOD BOX FOR A CUSPADORE SHE HAD A VINEGARY SLANGY TONGUE
7226-86965-0004 AND BEING SOMEWHAT DEAF WOULD BREAK IN UPON THE CONVERSATION WITH REMARKS SHARPER THAN THEY WERE PAT WITH OUR HOST A GLIB AND RAPID TALKER IN A SWAGGERING TONE ONE COULD NOT BUT BE MUCH AMUSED
7226-86965-0005 AS HE EXHIBITED A DEGREE OF SELF APPRECIATION THAT WAS DECIDEDLY REFRESHING HE HAD BEEN A VETERAN IN THE WAR OF THE REBELLION HE PROUDLY ASSURED US AND POINTED WITH HIS KNIFE TO HIS DISCHARGE PAPER WHICH WAS HUNG UP IN AN OLD LOOKING GLASS FRAME
7226-86965-0006 BY THE SIDE OF THE CLOCK GEMMEN HE INVARIABLY THUS ADDRESSED US AS THOUGH WE WERE A COTERIE OF CHECKER PLAYERS AT A VILLAGE GROCERY GEMMEN WHEN I SEEN HOW THEM JOHNNY REBS WAS A USIN OUR BOYS IN THEM PRISON PENS
7226-86965-0007 JOE MY BOY YOU GO NOW AN DO SOME'N FER YER COUNTRY A CRACK SHOT LIKE YOU IS JOE SAYS I TO MYSELF AS KIN HIT A DUCK ON THE WING EVERY TIME AN NO MISTAKE

7226-86965-0014 THERE WAS HEAPS O BLOOD SPILT UNNECESSARY BY US BOYS A FIGHTIN TO SAVE THE OL FLAG
7226-86965-0015 I SAID TO OUR LANDLORD BY WAY OF HELPING ALONG THE CONVERSATION THERE WAS A MOMENTARY SILENCE BROKEN BY SIMPLE SIMON WHO WIPED HIS KNIFE ON HIS TONGUE AND MADE A WILD ATTACK ON THE BUTTER DISH PA HE DRUV A MULE TEAM FOR GOV'MENT
7226-86965-0016 WITH A BIG AMMERNITION WAGIN ON BEHIND
7226-86965-0017 THIS SUDDEN REVELATION OF THE STRENGTH OF THE VETERAN'S CLAIM TO GLORY AND A PENSION PUT A DAMPER UPON HIS REMINISCENCES OF THE WAR AND GIVING THE INNOCENT SIMON A SAVAGE LEER
7226-86965-0018 HE SOON CONTRIVED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION UPON HIS WONDERFUL EXPLOITS IN DUCK SHOOTING AND FISHING INDUSTRIES IN THE PURSUIT OF WHICH HE WITH SO MANY OF HIS FELLOW FARMERS ON THE BOTTOMS APPEARED TO BE MORE EAGER THAN IN TILLING THE SOIL
7226-86965-0019 IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THE BREAKFAST WE WERE EATING WAS A SPECIAL SPREAD IN HONOR OF PROBABLY THE ONLY GUESTS THE QUONDAM TAVERN HAD HAD THESE MANY MONTHS CANOEISTS MUST NOT BE TOO PARTICULAR ABOUT THE FARE SET BEFORE THEM BUT ON THIS OCCASION
7226-86965-0020 WE WERE ABLE TO SWALLOW BUT A FEW MOUTHFULS OF THE REPAST AND OUR LUNCH BASKET WAS DRAWN ON AS SOON AS WE WERE ONCE MORE AFLOAT IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SO MANY FARMERS WIVES ARE THE WRETCHED COOKS THEY ARE
7226-86965-0021 WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF GOOD MATERIALS ALREADY ABOUT THEM AND RARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR READILY ACQUIRING MORE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RURAL DAMES DO MANAGE TO PREPARE ASTONISHINGLY INEDIBLE MEALS
7226-86965-0022 SOUR DOUGHY BREAD POTATOES WHICH IF BOILED ARE BUT HALF COOKED AND IF MASHED ARE FLOATED WITH ABOMINABLE BUTTER OR PASTEY FLOUR GRAVY SALT PORK EITHER SWIMMING IN A BOWL OF GREASE OR FRIED TO A LEATHERY CHIP
7226-86965-0023 TEA AND COFFEE EXTREMELY WEAK OR STRONG ENOUGH TO KILL AN OX AS CHANCE MAY DICTATE AND INEVITABLY ADULTERATED BEYOND RECOGNITION
7226-86965-0024 EGGS THAT ARE SPOILED BY BEING FRIED TO THE CONSISTENCY OF RUBBER IN A PAN OF FAT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT DOUGHNUTS WHILE THE BISCUITS ARE YELLOW AND BITTER WITH SALERATUS THIS BILL OF FARE WARRANTED TO DESTROY THE BEST OF APPETITES
7226-86965-0025 WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY TOO MANY OF MY READERS AS THAT TO BE FOUND AT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FARM HOUSE ALTHOUGH WE ALL DOUBTLESS KNOW OF SOME MAGNIFICENT EXCEPTIONS WHICH ONLY PROVE THE RULE WE ESTABLISH PUBLIC COOKING SCHOOLS IN OUR CITIES
7226-86965-0026 AND ECONOMISTS LIKE EDWARD ATKINSON AND HYGIENISTS LIKE THE LATE DIO LEWIS ASSIDUOUSLY EXPLAIN TO THE METROPOLITAN POOR THEIR PROCESSES OF MAKING A TEMPTING MEAL OUT OF NOTHING
7226-86965-0027 BUT OUR MOST CRYING NEED IN THIS COUNTRY TO DAY IS A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR RURAL HOUSEWIVES WHERE THEY MAY BE TAUGHT TO EVOLVE A RESPECTABLE AND ECONOMICAL SPREAD OUT OF THE GREAT ABUNDANCE WITH WHICH THEY ARE SURROUNDED
7226-86965-0028 IT IS NO WONDER THAT COUNTRY BOYS DRIFT TO THE CITIES WHERE THEY CAN OBTAIN PROPERLY COOKED FOOD AND LIVE LIKE RATIONAL BEINGS THE RIVER CONTINUES TO WIDEN AS WE APPROACH THE JUNCTION WITH THE MISSISSIPPI THIRTY NINE MILES BELOW ERIE
7226-86965-0029 AND TO ASSUME THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREAT RIVER INTO WHICH IT POURS ITS FLOOD THE ISLANDS INCREASE IN NUMBER AND IN SIZE SOME OF THEM BEING OVER A MILE IN LENGTH BY A QUARTER OF A MILE IN BREADTH
7226-86965-0030 THE BOTTOMS FREQUENTLY RESOLVE THEMSELVES INTO WIDE MORASSES THICKLY STUDDED WITH GREAT ELMS MAPLES AND COTTON WOODS AMONG WHICH THE SPRING FLOOD HAS WROUGHT DIREFUL DESTRUCTION THE SCENE BECOMES PECULIARLY DESOLATE
7226-86965-0031 AND MOURNFUL OFTEN GIVING ONE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING FAR REMOVED FROM CIVILIZATION THREADING THE COURSE OF SOME HITHERTO UNEXPLORED STREAM PENETRATE THE DEEP FRINGE OF FOREST AND MORASS ON FOOT HOWEVER AND SMILING PRAIRIES ARE FOUND BEYOND
7226-86965-0032 OF BEING EITHER GROUNDED OR CAPSIZED NOW AND THEN THE BANKS BECOME FIRMER WITH CHARMING VISTAS OF HIGH WOODED HILLS COMING DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE BROAD SAVANNAS INTERVENE DECKED OUT WITH VARIEGATED FLORA
7226-86965-0033 THE SPIDER WORT THE LITTLE BLUE LOBELIA AND THE CUP WEED THESE SAVANNAS ARE APPARENTLY OVERFLOWED IN TIMES OF EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH WATER
7226-86965-0034 AND THERE ARE EVIDENCES THAT THE STREAM HAS OCCASIONALLY CHANGED ITS COURSE THROUGH THE SUNBAKED BANKS OF ASHY GRAY MUD IN YEARS LONG PAST AT CLEVELAND A STAID LITTLE VILLAGE ON AN OPEN PLAIN WHICH WE REACHED SOON AFTER THE DINNER HOUR
7226-86965-0035 THERE IS AN UNUSED MILL DAM GOING TO DECAY IN THE CENTRE THE MAIN CURRENT HAS WASHED OUT A BREADTH OF THREE OR FOUR RODS THROUGH WHICH THE PENT UP STREAM RUSHES WITH A ROAR AND A HUNDRED WHIRLPOOLS IT IS AN UGLY CREVASSE
7226-86965-0036 BUT A CAREFUL EXAMINATION SHOWED THE PASSAGE TO BE FEASIBLE SO WE RETREATED AN EIGHTH OF A MILE UP STREAM TOOK OUR BEARINGS AND WENT THROUGH WITH A SPEED THAT NEARLY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY AND APPEARED TO GREATLY ASTONISH A HALF DOZEN FISHERMEN
7226-86965-0037 IDLY ANGLING FROM THE DILAPIDATED APRON ON EITHER SIDE IT WAS LIKE GOING THROUGH CLEVELAND ON THE FAST MAIL FOURTEEN MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE ROCK IS THE CHICAGO BURLINGTON AND QUINCY RAILROAD BRIDGE WITH CARBON CLIFF ON THE NORTH
7226-86965-0038 AND COLOMA ON THE SOUTH EACH ONE MILE FROM THE RIVER THE DAY HAD BEEN DARK WITH OCCASIONAL SLIGHT SHOWERS AND A STIFF HEAD WIND SO THAT PROGRESS HAD BEEN SLOW WE BEGAN TO DEEM IT WORTH WHILE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS AT THE MOUTH
7226-86965-0039 STOPPING TO QUESTION THEM WE FOUND THEM BOTH WELL INFORMED AS TO THE RAILWAY TIME TABLES OF THE VICINITY AND THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LOWER RIVER THEY TOLD US THAT THE SCENERY FOR THE NEXT FOURTEEN MILES WAS SIMILAR IN ITS DARK DESOLATION TO THAT WHICH WE HAD PASSED THROUGH DURING THE DAY
7226-86965-0040 ALSO THAT OWING TO THE GREAT NUMBER OF ISLANDS AND THE LABYRINTH OF CHANNELS BOTH IN THE ROCK AND ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI WE SHOULD FIND IT PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE LATTER WE SHOULD DOUBTLESS PROCEED SEVERAL MILES BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0041 BEFORE WE NOTICED THAT THE CURRENT WAS SETTING PERSISTENTLY SOUTH AND THEN WOULD HAVE AN EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TASK IN RETRACING OUR COURSE AND PULLING UP STREAM TO OUR DESTINATION ROCK ISLAND WHICH IS SIX MILES NORTH OF THE DELTA OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0042 THEY STRONGLY ADVISED OUR GOING INTO ROCK ISLAND BY RAIL THE PRESENT LANDING WAS THE LAST CHANCE TO STRIKE A RAILWAY EXCEPT AT MILAN TWELVE MILES BELOW IT WAS NOW SO LATE THAT WE COULD NOT HOPE TO REACH MILAN BEFORE DARK
7226-86965-0043 AND MILAN WAS FARTHER FROM ROCK ISLAND THAN EITHER CARBON CLIFF OR COLOMA WITH LESS FREQUENT RAILWAY SERVICE FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS WE DECIDED TO ACCEPT THIS ADVICE AND TO SHIP FROM COLOMA
7226-86965-0044 TAKING A FINAL SPURT DOWN TO A FERRY LANDING A QUARTER OF A MILE BEYOND ON THE SOUTH BANK
7226-86965-0045 HAVING VOYAGED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILES IN SOMEWHAT LESS THAN SEVEN DAYS AND A HALF LEAVING W TO GOSSIP WITH THE FERRYMAN'S WIFE WHO CAME DOWN TO THE BANK WITH AN ARMFUL OF SMILING TWINS TO VIEW A CRAFT SO STRANGE TO HER VISION
7226-86965-0046 I WENT UP INTO THE COUNTRY TO ENGAGE A TEAM TO TAKE OUR BOAT UPON ITS LAST PORTAGE AFTER HAVING BEEN GRUFFLY REFUSED BY A CHURLISH FARMER WHO DOUBTLESS RECOGNIZED NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CANOEIST AND A TRAMP
7226-86965-0047 I STRUCK A BARGAIN WITH A NEGRO CULTIVATING A CORNFIELD WITH A SPAN OF COAL BLACK MULES AND IN HALF AN HOUR HE WAS AT THE FERRY LANDING WITH A WAGON WASHING OUT THE CANOE AND CHAINING IN THE OARS AND PADDLE WE LIFTED IT INTO THE WAGON BOX
7226-86965-0048 PILED OUR BAGGAGE ON TOP AND SET OFF OVER THE HILLS AND FIELDS TO COLOMA
7226-86965-0049 ANKLE DEEP IN MUD FOR THE LATE RAINS HAD WELL MOISTENED THE BLACK PRAIRIE SOIL IT WAS A UNIQUE AND PICTURESQUE PROCESSION
7312-92432-0000 MAY TEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE MADAME
7312-92432-0001 IN COMPLIANCE WITH YOUR REQUEST I HAVE THE HONOR TO STATE SUCCINCTLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LATE MADAME OSSOLI YOUR DECEASED SISTER DURING HER RESIDENCE IN ROME
7312-92432-0002 IN THE MONTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE ROME AS YOU ARE NO DOUBT AWARE WAS PLACED IN A STATE OF SIEGE BY THE APPROACH OF THE FRENCH ARMY IT WAS FILLED AT THAT TIME WITH EXILES AND FUGITIVES
7312-92432-0003 WHO HAD BEEN CONTENDING FOR YEARS FROM MILAN IN THE NORTH TO PALERMO IN THE SOUTH FOR THE REPUBLICAN CAUSE AND WHEN THE GATES WERE CLOSED IT WAS COMPUTED THAT THERE WERE OF ITALIANS ALONE THIRTEEN THOUSAND REFUGEES WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE CITY
