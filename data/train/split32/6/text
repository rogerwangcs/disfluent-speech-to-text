2514-149482-0000 HE RECEIVED FROM MISSUS LOWDER ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS VISIT TO KATE THE TELEGRAPHIC EXPRESSION OF A HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE FREE TO DINE WITH THEM THAT EVENING AND HIS FREEDOM AFFECTED HIM AS FORTUNATE EVEN THOUGH IN SOME DEGREE QUALIFIED BY HER MISSIVE
2514-149482-0001 EXPECTING AMERICAN FRIENDS WHOM I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU KNOW HIS KNOWLEDGE OF AMERICAN FRIENDS WAS CLEARLY AN ACCIDENT OF WHICH HE WAS TO TASTE THE FRUIT TO THE LAST BITTERNESS THIS APPREHENSION HOWEVER WE HASTEN TO ADD
2514-149482-0002 ENJOYED FOR HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE EVENT A CERTAIN MERCIFUL SHRINKAGE THE IMMEDIATE EVENT BEING THAT AT LANCASTER GATE FIVE MINUTES AFTER HIS DUE ARRIVAL PRESCRIBED HIM FOR EIGHT THIRTY MISSUS STRINGHAM CAME IN ALONE
2514-149482-0003 THE LONG DAYLIGHT THE POSTPONED LAMPS THE HABIT OF THE HOUR MADE DINNERS LATE AND GUESTS STILL LATER SO THAT PUNCTUAL AS HE WAS HE HAD FOUND MISSUS LOWDER ALONE WITH KATE HERSELF NOT YET IN THE FIELD
2514-149482-0004 HE HAD THUS HAD WITH HER SEVERAL BEWILDERING MOMENTS BEWILDERING BY REASON FAIRLY OF THEIR TACIT INVITATION TO HIM TO BE SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLE THIS WAS EXACTLY GOODNESS KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO BE
2514-149482-0005 BUT HE HAD NEVER HAD IT SO LARGELY AND FREELY SO SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLY FOR THAT MATTER IMPUTED TO HIM AS OF EASY ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS A PARTICULAR IN WHICH AUNT MAUD APPEARED TO OFFER HERSELF AS AN EXAMPLE APPEARED TO SAY QUITE AGREEABLY
2514-149482-0006 WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
2514-149482-0007 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS WELL TO ASK HER HOW FEASIBLE SHE SUPPOSED IT FOR A POOR YOUNG MAN TO RESEMBLE HER AT ANY POINT BUT HE HAD AFTER ALL SOON ENOUGH PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AS SHE WISHED BY LETTING HIS WONDER SHOW
2514-149482-0008 JUST A LITTLE AS SILLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS MOREOVER OF A SMALL STRANGE DREAD OF THE RESULTS OF DISCUSSION WITH HER STRANGE TRULY BECAUSE IT WAS HER GOOD NATURE NOT HER ASPERITY THAT HE FEARED ASPERITY MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM ANGRY
2514-149482-0009 IN WHICH THERE WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT GOOD NATURE IN HIS CONDITIONS HAD A TENDENCY TO MAKE HIM ASHAMED WHICH AUNT MAUD INDEED WONDERFULLY LIKING HIM FOR HIMSELF QUITE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING GUESSED TO SPARE HIM THEREFORE SHE ALSO AVOIDED DISCUSSION
2514-149482-0010 SHE KEPT HIM DOWN BY REFUSING TO QUARREL WITH HIM THIS WAS WHAT SHE NOW PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENJOY AND HIS SECRET DISCOMFORT WAS HIS SENSE THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT HIM BEING KEPT DOWN WAS A BORE BUT
2514-149482-0011 HIS GREAT DREAD VERILY WAS OF BEING ASHAMED WHICH WAS A THING DISTINCT AND IT MATTERED BUT LITTLE THAT HE WAS ASHAMED OF THAT TOO IT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF HIS POSITION THAT IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS THE TABLES COULD ALWAYS BE TURNED ON HIM
2514-149482-0012 THE PLACE HOWEVER MUFFLED IN CONVENIENCE AND DECORUM CONSTANTLY HUMMED FOR HIM WITH THAT THICK IRONY
2514-149482-0013 AND HE HAD ALREADY SEEN HOW LITTLE AID CAME TO HIM FROM DENOUNCING THE BRIBES AS UGLY IN FORM THAT WAS WHAT THE PRECIOUS METALS THEY ALONE COULD AFFORD TO BE IT WAS VAIN ENOUGH FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY TO TRY TO IMPART A GLOSS TO HIS OWN COMPARATIVE BRUMMAGEM
2514-149482-0014 THE HUMILIATION OF THIS IMPOTENCE WAS PRECISELY WHAT AUNT MAUD SOUGHT TO MITIGATE FOR HIM BY KEEPING HIM DOWN AND AS HER EFFORT TO THAT END HAD DOUBTLESS NEVER YET BEEN SO VISIBLE HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER FELT SO DEFINITELY PLACED IN THE WORLD
2514-149482-0015 AS WHILE HE WAITED WITH HER FOR HER HALF DOZEN OTHER GUESTS SHE WELCOMED HIM GENIALLY BACK FROM THE STATES AS TO HIS VIEW OF WHICH HER FEW QUESTIONS THOUGH NOT COHERENT WERE COMPREHENSIVE
2514-149482-0016 AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
2514-149482-0017 THE IDEA OF A VISIT TO THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY HAD CLEARLY BUT JUST OCCURRED TO HER YET SHE WAS TALKING OF IT AT THE END OF A MINUTE AS HER FAVOURITE DREAM HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN IT BUT HE PRETENDED TO THIS HELPED HER AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE
2514-149482-0018 TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND
2514-149482-0019 FOR NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THE PERSON TO THE RELIEF OF WHOSE SHYNESS HER NIECE OSTENSIBLY CAME THE OSTENSIBLE IN KATE STRUCK HIM ALTOGETHER ON THIS OCCASION AS PRODIGIOUS
2514-149482-0020 WHILE SCARCELY LESS PRODIGIOUS FOR THAT MATTER WAS HIS OWN READING ON THE SPOT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN HIS COMPANIONS A RELATION LIGHTED FOR HIM BY THE STRAIGHT LOOK NOT EXACTLY LOVING NOR LINGERING YET SEARCHING AND SOFT
2514-149482-0021 THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY
2514-149482-0022 AND CONSUMMATELY RECKONED THAT WAS THE STORY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR HER BENEFICENT DRAGON UNDER ARMS LIVING UP EVERY HOUR BUT ESPECIALLY AT FESTAL HOURS TO THE VALUE MISSUS LOWDER HAD ATTACHED TO HER
2514-149482-0023 HIGH AND FIXED THIS ESTIMATE RULED ON EACH OCCASION AT LANCASTER GATE THE SOCIAL SCENE SO THAT HE NOW RECOGNISED IN IT SOMETHING LIKE THE ARTISTIC IDEA THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE IMPOSED BY TRADITION BY GENIUS BY CRITICISM
2514-149482-0024 IN RESPECT TO A GIVEN CHARACTER ON A DISTINGUISHED ACTRESS AS SUCH A PERSON WAS TO DRESS THE PART TO WALK TO LOOK TO SPEAK IN EVERY WAY TO EXPRESS THE PART SO ALL THIS WAS WHAT KATE WAS TO DO FOR THE CHARACTER SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN
2514-149482-0025 THINGS ALL PERFECTLY PONDERABLE TO CRITICISM AND THE WAY FOR HER TO MEET CRITICISM WAS EVIDENTLY AT THE START TO BE SURE HER MAKE UP HAD HAD THE LAST TOUCH AND THAT SHE LOOKED AT LEAST NO WORSE THAN USUAL
2514-149482-0026 AUNT MAUD'S APPRECIATION OF THAT TO NIGHT WAS INDEED MANAGERIAL AND THE PERFORMER'S OWN CONTRIBUTION FAIRLY THAT OF THE FAULTLESS SOLDIER ON PARADE DENSHER SAW HIMSELF FOR THE MOMENT AS IN HIS PURCHASED STALL AT THE PLAY
2514-149482-0027 THE WATCHFUL MANAGER WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF A BOX AND THE POOR ACTRESS IN THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT SHE PASSED THE POOR PERFORMER HE COULD SEE HOW SHE ALWAYS PASSED HER WIG HER PAINT HER JEWELS EVERY MARK OF HER EXPRESSION IMPECCABLE
2514-149482-0028 AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER
2514-149482-0029 TIME AMONG THEM FOR HIM TO FEEL ALMOST TOO SCARED TO TAKE PART IN THE OVATION HE STRUCK HIMSELF AS HAVING LOST FOR THE MINUTE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SO THAT IN ANY CASE HE ONLY STARED IN SILENCE AT THE OLDER WOMAN'S TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
2514-149482-0030 IT WAS AS IF THE DRAMA IT THUS CAME TO HIM FOR THE FACT OF A DRAMA THERE WAS NO BLINKING WAS BETWEEN THEM THEM QUITE PREPONDERANTLY WITH MERTON DENSHER RELEGATED TO MERE SPECTATORSHIP A PAYING PLACE IN FRONT AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE
2514-149482-0031 THIS WAS WHY HIS APPRECIATION HAD TURNED FOR THE INSTANT TO FEAR HAD JUST TURNED AS WE HAVE SAID TO SICKNESS
2514-149482-0032 THAT THE DISCIPLINED FACE DID OFFER HIM OVER THE FOOTLIGHTS AS HE BELIEVED THE SMALL GLEAM FINE FAINT BUT EXQUISITE OF A SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE SO MIGHT A PRACTISED PERFORMER EVEN WHEN RAKED BY DOUBLE BARRELLED GLASSES SEEM TO BE ALL IN HER PART
2514-149482-0033 AND YET CONVEY A SIGN TO THE PERSON IN THE HOUSE SHE LOVED BEST THE DRAMA AT ALL EVENTS AS DENSHER SAW IT MEANWHILE WENT ON AMPLIFIED SOON ENOUGH BY THE ADVENT OF TWO OTHER GUESTS STRAY GENTLEMEN BOTH STRAGGLERS IN THE ROUT OF THE SEASON
2514-149482-0034 WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE
2514-149482-0035 THAT EACH IN HIS WAY MADE ONE THE EXPANSIVE THE OTHER THE CONTRACTILE EFFECT OF THE PERFECT WHITE WAISTCOAT A SCRATCH COMPANY OF TWO INNOCUOUS YOUTHS AND A PACIFIED VETERAN WAS THEREFORE WHAT NOW OFFERED ITSELF TO MISSUS STRINGHAM
2514-149482-0036 HER COMPANION AT THE LAST MOMENT HAD BEEN INDISPOSED POSITIVELY NOT WELL ENOUGH AND SO HAD PACKED HER OFF INSISTENTLY WITH EXCUSES WITH WILD REGRETS
2514-149482-0037 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR CHARMING FRIEND'S ILLNESS WAS THE FIRST THING KATE TOOK UP WITH DENSHER ON THEIR BEING ABLE AFTER DINNER
2514-149482-0038 NATURALLY AS SHE CALLED IT WHICH WASN'T WHAT HE DID TOGETHER BUT IT WAS ALREADY AS IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD BY AN ODD IMPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
2514-149482-0039 MISSUS LOWDER HAD MADE DEAR MILLY THE TOPIC AND IT PROVED ON THE SPOT A TOPIC AS FAMILIAR TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNGER AS TO THE SAGACIOUS OLDER MAN ANY KNOWLEDGE THEY MIGHT LACK MISSUS LOWDER'S NIECE WAS MOREOVER ALERT TO SUPPLY
2514-149482-0040 WHILE DENSHER HIMSELF WAS FREELY APPEALED TO AS THE MOST PRIVILEGED AFTER ALL OF THE GROUP WASN'T IT HE WHO HAD IN A MANNER INVENTED THE WONDERFUL CREATURE THROUGH HAVING SEEN HER FIRST CAUGHT HER IN HER NATIVE JUNGLE HADN'T HE MORE OR LESS PAVED THE WAY
2514-149482-0041 FOR HER BY HIS PROMPT RECOGNITION OF HER RARITY BY PRECEDING HER IN A FRIENDLY SPIRIT AS HE HAD THE EAR OF SOCIETY WITH A SHARP FLASHLIGHT OR TWO HE MET POOR DENSHER THESE ENQUIRIES AS HE COULD
2514-149482-0042 LISTENING WITH INTEREST YET WITH DISCOMFORT WINCING IN PARTICULAR DRY JOURNALIST AS HE WAS TO FIND IT SEEMINGLY SUPPOSED OF HIM THAT HE HAD PUT HIS PEN OH HIS PEN AT THE SERVICE OF PRIVATE DISTINCTION THE EAR OF SOCIETY
2514-149482-0043 THEY WERE TALKING OR ALMOST AS IF HE HAD PUBLICLY PARAGRAPHED A MODEST YOUNG LADY THEY DREAMT DREAMS IN TRUTH HE APPEARED TO PERCEIVE THAT FAIRLY WAKED HIM UP AND HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS PLACE
2514-149482-0044 BOTH TO RESIST HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND TO CATCH THE FULL REVELATION HIS EMBARRASSMENT CAME NATURALLY FROM THE FACT THAT IF HE COULD CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR MISS THEALE'S SUCCESS SO NEITHER COULD HE GRACEFULLY INSIST ON HIS NOT HAVING BEEN CONCERNED WITH HER
2514-149482-0045 MISSUS LOWDER HAD WONDERS TO TELL OF IT THE TWO WEARERS OF THE WAISTCOAT EITHER WITH SINCERITY OR WITH HYPOCRISY PROFESSED IN THE MATTER AN EQUAL EXPERTNESS AND DENSHER AT LAST SEEMED TO KNOW HIMSELF IN PRESENCE OF A SOCIAL CASE
2514-149482-0046 IT WAS MISSUS STRINGHAM OBVIOUSLY WHOSE TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST INVOKED HADN'T SHE BEEN AS HER FRIEND'S REPRESENTATIVE RATHER CONFINED TO THE FUNCTION OF INHALING THE INCENSE SO THAT KATE
2514-149482-0047 WHO TREATED HER BEAUTIFULLY SMILING AT HER CHEERING AND CONSOLING HER ACROSS THE TABLE APPEARED BENEVOLENTLY BOTH TO SPEAK AND TO INTERPRET FOR HER KATE SPOKE AS IF SHE WOULDN'T PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THEIR WAY OF APPRECIATING MILLY
2514-149482-0048 BUT WOULD LET THEM NONE THE LESS IN JUSTICE TO THEIR GOOD WILL EXPRESS IT IN THEIR COARSER FASHION DENSHER HIMSELF WASN'T UNCONSCIOUS IN RESPECT TO THIS OF A CERTAIN BROAD BROTHERHOOD WITH MISSUS STRINGHAM WONDERING INDEED WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE TALK HOW
2514-149482-0049 IT MIGHT MOVE AMERICAN NERVES HE HAD ONLY HEARD OF THEM BEFORE BUT IN HIS RECENT TOUR HE HAD CAUGHT THEM IN THE REMARKABLE FACT AND THERE WAS NOW A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN IT CAME TO HIM THAT HE HAD PERHAPS AND NOT IN THE WAY OF AN ESCAPE
2514-149482-0050 TAKEN A LESSON FROM THEM THEY QUIVERED CLEARLY THEY HUMMED AND DRUMMED THEY LEAPED AND BOUNDED IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S TYPICAL ORGANISM THIS LADY STRIKING HIM AS BEFORE ALL THINGS EXCITED AS IN THE NATIVE PHRASE KEYED UP
2514-149482-0051 TO A PERCEPTION OF MORE ELEMENTS IN THE OCCASION THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ABLE TO COUNT SHE WAS ACCESSIBLE TO SIDES OF IT HE IMAGINED THAT WERE AS YET OBSCURE TO HIM FOR THOUGH SHE UNMISTAKEABLY REJOICED AND SOARED
2514-149482-0052 HER LITTLE DRY NEW ENGLAND BRIGHTNESS HE HAD SAMPLED ALL THE SHADES OF THE AMERICAN COMPLEXITY IF COMPLEXITY IT WERE HAD ITS ACTUAL REASONS FOR FINDING RELIEF MOST IN SILENCE
2514-149482-0053 SO THAT BEFORE THE SUBJECT WAS CHANGED HE PERCEIVED WITH SURPRISE AT THE OTHERS THAT THEY HAD GIVEN HER ENOUGH OF IT
2514-149482-0054 HAD REALLY NOT MADE IN HER OWN COUNTRY THE MARK SHE HAD CHALKED SO LARGE IN LONDON
2514-149482-0055 WHILE HE SCARCE KNEW IF HE WERE THE MORE IMPRESSED WITH HER LAUNCHING IT UNDER MISSUS STRINGHAM'S NOSE OR WITH HER HOPE THAT HE WOULD ALLOW TO LONDON THE HONOUR OF DISCOVERY THE LESS EXPANSIVE OF THE WHITE WAISTCOATS PROPOUNDED THE THEORY THAT THEY SAW IN LONDON
2514-149482-0056 FOR ALL THAT WAS SAID MUCH FURTHER THAN IN THE STATES IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HE URGED THAT THEY HAD TAUGHT THE AMERICANS TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FUNNY SOME NATIVE PRODUCT
2514-149482-0057 BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS
2514-149482-0058 THEY SOMETIMES SENT OUT BEAUTIES AND CELEBRITIES WHO LEFT THE BRITON COLD THE BRITON'S TEMPERATURE IN TRUTH WASN'T TO BE CALCULATED A FORMULATION OF THE MATTER THAT WAS NOT REACHED
2514-149482-0059 SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE POINT OF VIEW FOR A PROPER ADMIRATION OF HER YOUNG FRIEND HAD SEEMED TO FAIL A LITTLE IN NEW YORK THERE WAS NO MANNER OF DOUBT OF HER HAVING CARRIED BOSTON BY STORM
2514-149482-0060 IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING
2514-149482-0061 THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND
2514-149482-0062 HE HADN'T PRETENDED HE DID BUT THERE WAS A PURITY OF REPROACH IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S FACE AND TONE A PURITY CHARGED APPARENTLY WITH SOLEMN MEANINGS SO THAT FOR A LITTLE SMALL AS HAD BEEN HIS CLAIM HE COULDN'T BUT FEEL THAT SHE EXAGGERATED
2514-149482-0063 BUT WHILE DOING SO HE DEFENDED HIMSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ENORMOUSLY MUCH BEYOND HER HAVING BEEN MOST KIND TO ME IN NEW YORK AS A POOR BEWILDERED AND NEWLY LANDED ALIEN
2514-149482-0064 AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION
2514-149482-0065 THOUGH WHAT IT EXPRESSED HE FAILED AT THE TIME TO MAKE OUT YOU WEREN'T PRESENT THEN DEAREST MISSUS LOWDER RICHLY CONCURRED YOU DON'T KNOW SHE CONTINUED WITH MELLOW GAIETY HOW FAR THINGS MAY HAVE GONE
2514-149482-0066 IT MADE THE LITTLE WOMAN HE COULD SEE REALLY LOSE HER HEAD SHE HAD MORE THINGS IN THAT HEAD THAN ANY OF THEM IN ANY OTHER UNLESS PERHAPS IT WERE KATE WHOM HE FELT AS INDIRECTLY WATCHING HIM DURING THIS FOOLISH PASSAGE
2514-149482-0067 AND BECAUSE OF THE FOOLISHNESS NOT TO MEET HER EYES HE MET MISSUS STRINGHAM'S WHICH AFFECTED HIM WITH HER HE COULD ON OCCASION CLEAR IT UP A SENSE PRODUCED BY THE MUTE COMMUNION BETWEEN THEM AND
2514-149482-0068 REALLY THE BEGINNING AS THE EVENT WAS TO SHOW OF SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS EVEN ALREADY A LITTLE THE EFFECT OF THIS COMMUNION THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM PERCEPTIBLY FALTERED IN HER RETORT TO MISSUS LOWDER'S JOKE
2514-149482-0069 OH IT'S PRECISELY MY POINT THAT MISTER DENSHER CAN'T HAVE HAD VAST OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SHE SMILED AT HIM I WASN'T AWAY YOU KNOW LONG IT MADE EVERYTHING IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY RIGHT FOR HIM
2514-149482-0070 AND I WASN'T THERE LONG EITHER HE POSITIVELY SAW WITH IT THAT NOTHING FOR HIM SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED WOULD AGAIN BE WRONG SHE'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T SAY SHE'S EASY TO KNOW
2514-149482-0071 AS IF NOW TO KEEP WELL WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING BETTER SHE WAS OFF WITH YOU TO THESE PARTS BEFORE I KNEW IT I MYSELF WAS OFF TOO AWAY OFF TO WONDERFUL PARTS WHERE I HAD ENDLESSLY MORE TO SEE
2514-149482-0072 BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS
2514-149482-0073 SHE'LL THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR SAID MISSUS STRINGHAM WITH A FLUSHED FIRMNESS YET DOESN'T SILENCE IN SUCH A CASE AUNT MAUD BLANDLY ENQUIRED VERY OFTEN QUITE PROVE THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION
2514-149482-0074 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSED HADN'T HE BEEN SLIGHTLY DISPLEASED AT ALL THEY SEEMED DESIROUS TO FASTEN ON HIM WELL THE IMPRESSION WAS AS DEEP AS YOU LIKE BUT I REALLY WANT MISS THEALE TO KNOW HE PURSUED FOR MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT I DON'T FIGURE BY ANY CONSENT OF MY OWN
2514-149482-0075 KATE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE IF ASSISTANCE IT WAS BEFORE THEIR FRIEND HAD HAD TIME TO MEET THIS CHARGE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER NOT BEING EASY TO KNOW ONE SEES HER WITH INTENSITY SEES HER MORE THAN ONE SEES ALMOST ANY ONE BUT THEN ONE DISCOVERS
2514-149482-0076 THAT THAT ISN'T KNOWING HER AND THAT ONE MAY KNOW BETTER A PERSON WHOM ONE DOESN'T SEE AS I SAY HALF SO MUCH THE DISCRIMINATION WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE FACT OF HER SUCCESS AND IT WAS AT THAT COMPARATIVELY GROSS CIRCUMSTANCE
2514-149482-0077 NOW SO FULLY PLACED BEFORE THEM THAT MILLY'S ANXIOUS COMPANION SAT AND LOOKED LOOKED VERY MUCH AS SOME SPECTATOR IN AN OLD TIME CIRCUS MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ODDITY OF A CHRISTIAN MAIDEN IN THE ARENA MILDLY CARESSINGLY MARTYRED
2514-149482-0078 IT WAS THE NOSING AND FUMBLING NOT OF LIONS AND TIGERS BUT OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS LET LOOSE AS FOR THE JOKE EVEN THE JOKE MADE MISSUS STRINGHAM UNEASY AND HER MUTE COMMUNION WITH DENSHER TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED
2514-149482-0079 HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
2514-149482-0080 IF SHE ACTUALLY MISSED AT ANY RATE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S DISCOMFORT THAT BUT SHOWED HOW HER OWN IDEA HELD HER HER OWN IDEA WAS BY INSISTING ON THE FACT OF THE GIRL'S PROMINENCE AS A FEATURE OF THE SEASON'S END
2514-149482-0081 TO KEEP DENSHER IN RELATION FOR THE REST OF THEM BOTH TO PRESENT AND TO PAST IT'S EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT MAKES YOU NATURALLY A LITTLE SHY ABOUT HER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BUT WE DO WE'VE SEEN IT AND FOLLOWED IT
2514-149482-0082 WE'VE A LITTLE BEEN OF IT THE GREAT THING FOR HIM AT THIS AS KATE GAVE IT WAS IN FACT QUITE IRRESISTIBLY THAT THE CASE WAS A REAL ONE THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN ONE'S PATIENCE WAS SHORTER THAN ONE'S CURIOSITY
2514-149482-0083 ONE HAD VAGUELY TAKEN FOR POSSIBLE IN LONDON BUT IN WHICH ONE HAD NEVER BEEN EVEN TO THIS SMALL EXTENT CONCERNED THE LITTLE AMERICAN'S SUDDEN SOCIAL ADVENTURE HER HAPPY AND NO DOUBT HARMLESS FLOURISH
2514-149482-0084 HAD PROBABLY BEEN FAVOURED BY SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BUT IT HAD BEEN FAVOURED ABOVE ALL BY THE SIMPLE SPRING BOARD OF THE SCENE BY ONE OF THOSE COMMON CAPRICES OF THE NUMBERLESS FOOLISH FLOCK GREGARIOUS MOVEMENTS AS INSCRUTABLE
2514-149482-0085 AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY
2514-149482-0086 BUT THE GREAT REASON WAS PROBABLY THE ABSENCE AT THE MOMENT OF A LARGER LION THE BIGGER BEAST WOULD COME AND THE SMALLER WOULD THEN INCONTINENTLY VANISH IT WAS AT ALL EVENTS CHARACTERISTIC
2514-149482-0087 AND WHAT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF IT WAS GRIST TO HIS SCRIBBLING MILL MATTER FOR HIS JOURNALISING HAND THAT HAND ALREADY IN INTENTION PLAYED OVER IT THE MOTIVE AS A SIGN OF THE SEASON A FEATURE OF THE TIME OF THE PURELY EXPEDITIOUS
2514-149482-0088 AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
2514-149482-0089 THE AUTHOR OF THE ROTTEN BOOK THE BEAUTY WHO WAS NO BEAUTY THE HEIRESS WHO WAS ONLY THAT THE STRANGER WHO WAS FOR THE MOST PART SAVED FROM BEING INCONVENIENTLY STRANGE BUT BY BEING INCONVENIENTLY FAMILIAR
2514-149482-0090 THE CREATURE IN FINE AS TO WHOM SPANGLES OR SPOTS OF ANY SUFFICIENTLY MARKED AND EXHIBITED SORT COULD BE LOUDLY ENOUGH PREDICATED
2514-149482-0091 AND THE TONE OF SOCIETY WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE HIM TAKE UP AGAIN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF CIVILISED BUT IF THIS WAS CIVILISATION ONE COULD SMOKE ONE'S PIPE OUTSIDE WHEN TWADDLE WAS WITHIN
2514-149482-0092 HE HAD RATHER AVOIDED AS WE HAVE REMARKED KATE'S EYES BUT THERE CAME A MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD FAIRLY HAVE LIKED TO PUT IT ACROSS THE TABLE TO HER I SAY LIGHT OF MY LIFE IS THIS THE GREAT WORLD
2514-149482-0093 THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
2514-149482-0094 NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS
2514-149482-0095 SHE ENUNCIATED TO RELIEVE HIS BEWILDERMENT THE OBVIOUS TRUTH THAT YOU COULDN'T LEAVE LONDON FOR THREE MONTHS AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AND COME BACK TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS JUST WHERE THEY WERE AS THEY HAD OF COURSE BEEN JIGGING AWAY
2514-149482-0096 THEY MIGHT WELL BE SO RED IN THE FACE THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEM SHE RECONCILED IN FINE HIS DISCLAIMER ABOUT MILLY WITH THAT HONOUR OF HAVING DISCOVERED HER WHICH IT WAS VAIN FOR HIM MODESTLY TO SHIRK HE HAD UNEARTHED HER
2514-149482-0097 BUT IT WAS THEY ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WHO HAD DEVELOPED HER SHE WAS ALWAYS A CHARMER ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SEEN BUT SHE WASN'T THE PERSON HE HAD BACKED
2514-149482-0098 DENSHER WAS TO FEEL SURE AFTERWARDS THAT KATE HAD HAD IN THESE PLEASANTRIES NO CONSCIOUS ABOVE ALL NO INSOLENT PURPOSE OF MAKING LIGHT OF POOR SUSAN SHEPHERD'S PROPERTY IN THEIR YOUNG FRIEND WHICH PROPERTY BY SUCH REMARKS
2514-149482-0099 WAS VERY MUCH PUSHED TO THE WALL BUT HE WAS ALSO TO KNOW THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM HAD SECRETLY RESENTED THEM MISSUS STRINGHAM HOLDING THE OPINION OF WHICH HE WAS ULTIMATELY TO HAVE A GLIMPSE THAT ALL THE KATE CROYS IN CHRISTENDOM WERE BUT DUST FOR THE FEET OF HER MILLY
2514-149482-0100 THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL
2514-149482-0101 SHE SLIPPED IN THE OBSERVATION THAT HER MILLY WAS INCAPABLE OF CHANGE WAS JUST EXACTLY ON THE CONTRARY
2514-149482-0102 SHE WAS PERFECTLY KIND TO SUSIE IT WAS AS IF SHE POSITIVELY KNEW HER AS HANDICAPPED FOR ANY DISAGREEMENT BY FEELING THAT SHE KATE HAD TYPE AND BY BEING COMMITTED TO ADMIRATION OF TYPE
2514-149482-0103 KATE HAD OCCASION SUBSEQUENTLY SHE FOUND IT SOMEHOW TO MENTION TO OUR YOUNG MAN MILLY'S HAVING SPOKEN TO HER OF THIS VIEW ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART SHE WOULD LIKE MILLY HAD HAD IT FROM HER TO PUT KATE CROY IN A BOOK AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SO DO WITH HER
2514-149482-0104 CHOP ME UP FINE OR SERVE ME WHOLE IT WAS A WAY OF BEING GOT AT THAT KATE PROFESSED SHE DREADED IT WOULD BE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S HOWEVER SHE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE MISSUS STRINGHAM ODDLY FELT
2514-149482-0105 THAT WITH SUCH STUFF AS THE STRANGE ENGLISH GIRL WAS MADE OF STUFF THAT IN SPITE OF MAUD MANNINGHAM WHO WAS FULL OF SENTIMENT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN THERE WAS NONE OTHER TO BE EMPLOYED THESE THINGS WERE OF LATER EVIDENCE
2514-149482-0106 YET DENSHER MIGHT EVEN THEN HAVE FELT THEM IN THE AIR THEY WERE PRACTICALLY IN IT ALREADY WHEN KATE WAIVING THE QUESTION OF HER FRIEND'S CHEMICAL CHANGE WOUND UP WITH THE COMPARATIVELY UNOBJECTIONABLE PROPOSITION THAT HE MUST NOW HAVING MISSED SO MUCH
2514-149482-0107 TAKE THEM ALL UP ON TRUST FURTHER ON HE MET IT PEACEFULLY A LITTLE PERHAPS AS AN EXAMPLE TO MISSUS STRINGHAM OH AS FAR ON AS YOU LIKE THIS EVEN HAD ITS EFFECT MISSUS STRINGHAM APPROPRIATED AS MUCH OF IT AS MIGHT BE MEANT FOR HERSELF
289-121652-0000 NONE OF US WHETHER CHILDREN OR ADULTS NEEDS AN INTRODUCTION TO MOTHER GOOSE THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE EARLIEST IMPRESSED UPON OUR MINDS CLING TO THEM MOST TENACIOUSLY THE SNATCHES SUNG IN THE NURSERY ARE NEVER FORGOTTEN
289-121652-0001 NOR ARE THEY EVER RECALLED WITHOUT BRINGING BACK WITH THEM MYRIADS OF SLUMBERING FEELINGS AND HALF FORGOTTEN IMAGES WE HEAR THE SWEET LOW VOICE OF THE MOTHER SINGING SOFT LULLABIES TO HER DARLING
289-121652-0002 AND SEE THE KINDLY WRINKLED FACE OF THE GRANDMOTHER AS SHE CROONS THE OLD DITTIES TO QUIET OUR RESTLESS SPIRITS ONE GENERATION IS LINKED TO ANOTHER BY THE EVERLASTING SPIRIT OF SONG
289-121652-0003 THE BALLADS OF THE NURSERY FOLLOW US FROM CHILDHOOD TO OLD AGE AND THEY ARE READILY BROUGHT FROM MEMORY'S RECESSES AT ANY TIME TO AMUSE OUR CHILDREN OR OUR GRANDCHILDREN THE COLLECTION OF JINGLES WE KNOW AND LOVE AS THE MELODIES OF MOTHER GOOSE
289-121652-0004 ARE EVIDENTLY DRAWN FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES WHILE THEY ARE TAKEN ALTOGETHER A HAPPY UNION OF RHYME WIT
289-121652-0005 THE RESEARCH AFTER THE AUTHOR OF EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE WOULD INDEED BE HOPELESS IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO SUPPOSE THEM ALL THE COMPOSITION OF UNEDUCATED OLD NURSES FOR MANY OF THEM CONTAIN MUCH REFLECTION WIT AND MELODY
289-121652-0006 IT IS SAID THAT SHELLEY WROTE PUSSY CAT MEW AND DEAN SWIFT LITTLE BO PEEP AND THESE ASSERTIONS ARE AS DIFFICULT TO DISPROVE AS TO PROVE SOME OF THE OLDER VERSES HOWEVER
289-121652-0007 ARE DOUBTLESS OFFSHOOTS FROM ANCIENT FOLK LORE SONGS AND HAVE DESCENDED TO US THROUGH MANY CENTURIES THE CONNECTION OF MOTHER GOOSE WITH THE RHYMES WHICH BEAR HER NAME IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AND IN FACT THREE COUNTRIES CLAIM HER FOR THEIR OWN
289-121652-0008 FRANCE ENGLAND AND AMERICA ABOUT THE YEAR SIXTEEN FIFTY THERE APPEARED IN CIRCULATION IN LONDON A SMALL BOOK NAMED RHYMES OF THE NURSERY OR LULLA BYES FOR CHILDREN
289-121652-0009 WHICH CONTAINED MANY OF THE IDENTICAL PIECES THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN TO US BUT THE NAME OF MOTHER GOOSE WAS EVIDENTLY NOT THEN KNOWN IN THIS EDITION WERE THE RHYMES OF LITTLE JACK HOMER OLD KING COLE MISTRESS MARY SING A SONG O SIXPENCE
289-121652-0010 AND LITTLE BOY BLUE IN SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN CHARLES PERRAULT PUBLISHED IN FRANCE
289-121652-0011 ALTHOUGH PERRAULT'S TALES DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE WE NOW KNOW UNDER THIS TITLE THEY COMPRISED THE SLEEPING BEAUTY THE FAIRY LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD BLUE BEARD PUSS IN BOOTS
289-121652-0012 RIQUET WITH THE TUFT CINDERELLA AND LITTLE THUMB EIGHT STORIES IN ALL ON THE COVER OF THE BOOK WAS DEPICTED AN OLD LADY HOLDING IN HER HAND A DISTAFF
289-121652-0013 AMERICA BASES HER CLAIM TO MOTHER GOOSE UPON THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT MADE BY THE LATE JOHN FLEET ELIOT A DESCENDANT OF THOMAS FLEET THE PRINTER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THERE LIVED IN BOSTON A LADY NAMED ELIZA GOOSE
289-121652-0014 WRITTEN ALSO VERGOOSE AND VERTIGOOSE WHO BELONGED TO A WEALTHY FAMILY HER ELDEST DAUGHTER ELIZABETH GOOSE OR VERTIGOOSE
289-121652-0015 AND IN DUE TIME GAVE BIRTH TO A SON LIKE MOST MOTHERS IN LAW IN OUR DAY THE IMPORTANCE OF MISSUS GOOSE INCREASED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF HER GRANDCHILD AND POOR MISTER FLEET HALF DISTRACTED WITH HER ENDLESS NURSERY DITTIES FINDING ALL OTHER MEANS FAIL
289-121652-0016 TRIED WHAT RIDICULE COULD EFFECT AND ACTUALLY PRINTED A BOOK UNDER THE TITLE SONGS OF THE NURSERY OR MOTHER GOOSE'S MELODIES FOR CHILDREN ON THE TITLE PAGE WAS THE PICTURE OF A GOOSE WITH A VERY LONG NECK AND A MOUTH WIDE OPEN AND BELOW THIS
289-121652-0017 PRINTED BY T FLEET AT HIS PRINTING HOUSE IN PUDDING LANE SEVENTEEN NINETEEN PRICE TWO COPPERS MISTER WM A WHEELER THE EDITOR OF HURD AND HOUGHTON'S ELABORATE EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY REITERATED THIS ASSERTION
289-121652-0018 AND A WRITER IN THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT OF JUNE SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR SAYS FLEET'S BOOK WAS PARTLY A REPRINT OF AN ENGLISH COLLECTION OF SONGS BARCLAY'S AND THE NEW TITLE WAS DOUBTLESS A COMPLIMENT BY THE PRINTER TO HIS MOTHER IN LAW GOOSE FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS
289-121652-0019 SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF SIXTEEN CHILDREN AND A TYPICAL OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE WE MAY TAKE IT TO BE TRUE THAT FLEET'S WIFE WAS OF THE VERGOOSE FAMILY AND THAT THE NAME WAS OFTEN CONTRACTED TO GOOSE
289-121652-0020 BUT THE REST OF THE STORY IS UNSUPPORTED BY ANY EVIDENCE WHATEVER IN FACT ALL THAT MISTER ELIOT KNEW OF IT WAS THE STATEMENT OF THE LATE EDWARD A CROWNINSHIELD OF BOSTON THAT HE HAD SEEN FLEET'S EDITION IN THE LIBRARY OF THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY
289-121652-0021 REPEATED RESEARCHES AT WORCESTER HAVING FAILED TO BRING TO LIGHT THIS SUPPOSED COPY AND NO RECORD OF IT APPEARING ON ANY CATALOGUE THERE WE MAY DISMISS THE ENTIRE STORY WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT MISTER ELIOT MISUNDERSTOOD THE REMARKS MADE TO HIM
289-121652-0022 INDEED AS MISTER WILLIAM H WHITMORE POINTS OUT IN HIS CLEVER MONOGRAPH UPON MOTHER GOOSE ALBANY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IT IS VERY DOUBTFUL WHETHER IN SEVENTEEN NINETEEN
289-121652-0023 BOSTON CHILDREN AT THAT DATE SAYS MISTER WHITMORE WERE FED UPON GOSPEL FOOD AND IT SEEMS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT AN EDITION COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD
289-121652-0024 IS OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS BOSTON'S THERE LIVED IN A TOWN IN SUSSEX ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN O FOUR AN OLD WOMAN NAMED MARTHA GOOCH SHE WAS A CAPITAL NURSE AND IN GREAT DEMAND TO CARE FOR NEWLY BORN BABIES THEREFORE
289-121652-0025 THROUGH LONG YEARS OF SERVICE AS NURSE SHE CAME TO BE CALLED MOTHER GOOCH THIS GOOD WOMAN HAD ONE PECULIARITY SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO CROON QUEER RHYMES AND JINGLES OVER THE CRADLES OF HER CHARGES AND THESE RHYMES
289-121652-0026 SEEMED SO SENSELESS AND SILLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO OVERHEARD THEM THAT THEY BEGAN TO CALL HER MOTHER GOOSE IN DERISION THE TERM BEING DERIVED FROM QUEEN GOOSEFOOT THE MOTHER OF CHARLEMAGNE THE OLD NURSE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER CRITICS
289-121652-0027 BUT CONTINUED TO SING HER RHYMES AS BEFORE FOR HOWEVER MUCH GROWN PEOPLE MIGHT LAUGH AT HER THE CHILDREN SEEMED TO ENJOY THEM VERY MUCH AND NOT ONE OF THEM WAS TOO PEEVISH TO BE QUIETED AND SOOTHED BY HER VERSES
289-121652-0028 AT ONE TIME MISTRESS GOOCH WAS NURSING A CHILD OF MISTER RONALD BARCLAY A PHYSICIAN RESIDING IN THE TOWN AND HE NOTICED THE RHYMES SHE SANG AND BECAME INTERESTED IN THEM IN TIME HE WROTE THEM ALL DOWN AND MADE A BOOK OF THEM
289-121652-0029 WHICH IT IS SAID WAS PRINTED BY JOHN WORTHINGTON AND SON IN THE STRAND LONDON IN SEVENTEEN TWELVE UNDER THE NAME OF YE MELODIOUS RHYMES OF MOTHER GOOSE BUT EVEN THIS STORY OF MARTHA GOOCH
289-121652-0030 IS BASED UPON VERY MEAGER AND UNSATISFACTORY EVIDENCE THE EARLIEST ENGLISH EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE'S MELODIES THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AUTHENTIC WAS ISSUED BY JOHN NEWBURY OF LONDON ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN SIXTY AND THE FIRST AUTHENTIC AMERICAN EDITION
289-121652-0031 IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE NONE OF THE EARLIER EDITIONS HOWEVER CONTAINED ALL THE RHYMES SO WELL KNOWN AT THE PRESENT DAY SINCE EVERY DECADE HAS ADDED ITS QUOTA TO THE MASS OF JINGLES ATTRIBUTED TO MOTHER GOOSE
289-121652-0032 SOME OF THE EARLIER VERSES HAVE BECOME ENTIRELY OBSOLETE AND IT IS WELL THEY HAVE FOR MANY WERE CRUDE AND SILLY AND OTHERS WERE COARSE IT IS SIMPLY A RESULT OF THE GREATER REFINEMENT OF MODERN CIVILIZATION
289-121652-0033 THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO OBLIVION WHILE THE REAL GEMS OF THE COLLECTION WILL DOUBTLESS LIVE AND GROW IN POPULAR FAVOR FOR MANY AGES
289-121652-0034 IT DOES NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST WHETHER SHE WAS IN REALITY A MYTH OR A LIVING ELIZA GOOSE MARTHA GOOCH OR THE MERE OYE OF PERRAULT THE SONGS THAT CLUSTER AROUND HER NAME ARE WHAT WE LOVE
289-121652-0035 AND EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE APPEALS MORE TO THE CHILDISH MIND THAN DOES MOTHER GOOSE HERSELF MANY OF THESE NURSERY RHYMES ARE COMPLETE TALES IN THEMSELVES TELLING THEIR STORY TERSELY BUT COMPLETELY THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH ARE BUT BARE SUGGESTIONS
289-121652-0036 LEAVING THE IMAGINATION TO WEAVE IN THE DETAILS OF THE STORY PERHAPS THEREIN MAY LIE PART OF THEIR CHARM BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE I HAVE THOUGHT THE CHILDREN MIGHT LIKE THE STORIES TOLD AT GREATER LENGTH THAT THEY MAY DWELL THE LONGER UPON THEIR FAVORITE HEROES AND HEROINES
289-121652-0037 FOR THAT REASON I HAVE WRITTEN THIS BOOK IN MAKING THE STORIES I HAVE FOLLOWED MAINLY THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE RHYMES AND MY HOPE IS THAT THE LITTLE ONES WILL LIKE THEM AND NOT FIND THAT THEY INTERFERE WITH THE FANCIFUL CREATIONS OF THEIR OWN IMAGINATIONS
289-121652-0038 L FRANK BAUM CHICAGO ILLINOIS
289-121665-0000 AND ONE OF THESE FLOCKS USED TO BE CARED FOR BY A POOR WOMAN WHO SUPPORTED HERSELF AND HER LITTLE GIRL BY THIS MEANS THEY LIVED IN A SMALL COTTAGE NESTLED AT THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE HILLS AND EACH MORNING THE MOTHER TOOK HER CROOK
289-121665-0001 AND STARTED OUT WITH HER SHEEP THAT THEY MIGHT FEED UPON THE TENDER JUICY GRASSES WITH WHICH THE HILLS ABOUNDED THE LITTLE GIRL USUALLY ACCOMPANIED HER MOTHER AND SAT BY HER SIDE
289-121665-0002 UPON THE GRASSY MOUNDS AND WATCHED HER CARE FOR THE EWES AND LAMBS SO THAT IN TIME SHE HERSELF GREW TO BE A VERY PROFICIENT SHEPHERDESS SO WHEN THE MOTHER BECAME TOO OLD AND FEEBLE TO LEAVE HER COTTAGE LITTLE BO PEEP AS SHE WAS CALLED
289-121665-0003 DECIDED THAT SHE WAS FULLY ABLE TO MANAGE THE FLOCKS HERSELF SHE WAS A LITTLE MITE OF A CHILD WITH FLOWING NUT BROWN LOCKS AND BIG GRAY EYES THAT CHARMED ALL WHO GAZED INTO THEIR INNOCENT DEPTHS SHE WORE A LIGHT GRAY FROCK
289-121665-0004 FASTENED ABOUT THE WAIST WITH A PRETTY PINK SASH AND THERE WERE WHITE RUFFLES AROUND HER NECK AND PINK RIBBONS IN HER HAIR ALL THE SHEPHERDS AND SHEPHERDESSES UPON THE HILLS BOTH YOUNG AND OLD SOON CAME TO KNOW LITTLE BO PEEP VERY WELL INDEED
289-121665-0005 AND THERE WERE MANY WILLING HANDS TO AID HER IF WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN SHE NEEDED THEIR ASSISTANCE BO PEEP USUALLY TOOK HER SHEEP TO THE SIDE OF A HIGH HILL ABOVE THE COTTAGE AND ALLOWED THEM TO EAT THE RICH GRASS WHILE SHE HERSELF SAT UPON A MOUND AND
289-121665-0006 LAYING ASIDE HER CROOK AND HER BROAD STRAW HAT WITH ITS PINK RIBBONS DEVOTED HER TIME TO SEWING AND MENDING STOCKINGS FOR HER AGED MOTHER ONE DAY WHILE THUS OCCUPIED
289-121665-0007 GOOD MORNING LITTLE BO PEEP AND LOOKING UP THE GIRL SAW A WOMAN STANDING NEAR HER AND LEANING UPON A SHORT STICK SHE WAS BENT NEARLY DOUBLE BY WEIGHT OF MANY YEARS HER HAIR WAS WHITE AS SNOW AND HER EYES AS BLACK AS COALS
289-121665-0008 DEEP WRINKLES SEAMED HER FACE AND HANDS WHILE HER NOSE AND CHIN WERE SO POINTED THAT THEY NEARLY MET SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK UPON BUT BO PEEP HAD LEARNED TO BE POLITE TO THE AGED SO SHE ANSWERED SWEETLY
289-121665-0009 GOOD MORNING MOTHER CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU NO DEARIE RETURNED THE WOMAN IN A CRACKED VOICE BUT I WILL SIT BY YOUR SIDE AND REST FOR A TIME THE GIRL MADE ROOM ON THE MOUND BESIDE HER
289-121665-0010 AND THE STRANGER SAT DOWN AND WATCHED IN SILENCE THE BUSY FINGERS SEW UP THE SEAMS OF THE NEW FROCK SHE WAS MAKING BY AND BY THE WOMAN ASKED WHY DO YOU COME OUT HERE TO SEW BECAUSE I AM A SHEPHERDESS REPLIED THE GIRL

289-121665-0014 THE OLD WOMAN CHUCKLED SOFTLY AS IF THE ANSWER AMUSED HER AND REPLIED NO ONE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING MY DEAR BUT I KNOW ALL ABOUT MY SHEEP PROTESTED LITTLE BO PEEP DO YOU INDEED
289-121665-0015 THEN YOU ARE WISER THAT MOST PEOPLE AND IF YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM YOU ALSO KNOW THEY WILL COME HOME OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL ALL BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AS USUAL
289-121665-0016 OH SAID LITTLE BO PEEP IN SURPRISE DO THEY WAG THEIR TAILS I NEVER NOTICED THAT INDEED EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN THEN YOU ARE NOT VERY OBSERVING FOR ONE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT SHEEP
289-121665-0017 PERHAPS YOU HAVE NEVER NOTICED THEIR TAILS AT ALL NO ANSWERED BO PEEP THOUGHTFULLY I DO N'T KNOW THAT I EVER HAVE THE WOMAN LAUGHED SO HARD AT THIS REPLY
289-121665-0018 THAT SHE BEGAN TO COUGH AND THIS MADE THE GIRL REMEMBER THAT HER FLOCK HAD STRAYED AWAY I REALLY MUST GO AND FIND MY SHEEP SHE SAID RISING TO HER FEET AND THEN I SHALL BE SURE TO NOTICE THEIR TAILS AND SEE IF THEY WAG THEM SIT STILL MY CHILD
289-121665-0019 SAID THE OLD WOMAN I AM GOING OVER THE HILL TOP MYSELF AND I WILL SEND THE SHEEP BACK TO YOU SO SHE GOT UPON HER FEET AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL AND THE GIRL HEARD HER SAYING AS SHE WALKED AWAY LITTLE BO PEEP HAS LOST HER SHEEP
289-121665-0020 AND DOES N'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND EM BUT LEAVE EM ALONE AND THEY LL COME HOME ALL WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND EM LITTLE BO PEEP SAT STILL AND WATCHED THE OLD WOMAN TOIL SLOWLY UP THE HILL SIDE AND DISAPPEAR OVER THE TOP BY AND BY SHE THOUGHT
289-121665-0021 VERY SOON I SHALL SEE THE SHEEP COMING BACK BUT TIME PASSED AWAY AND STILL THE ERRANT FLOCK FAILED TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE SOON THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS BEGAN TO NOD
289-121665-0022 LITTLE BO PEEP FELL FAST ASLEEP AND DREAMT SHE HEARD THEM BLEATING BUT WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE FOUND IT A JOKE FOR STILL THEY WERE A FLEETING THE GIRL NOW BECAME QUITE ANXIOUS AND WONDERED WHY THE OLD WOMAN HAD NOT DRIVEN HER FLOCK OVER THE HILL
289-121665-0023 BUT AS IT WAS NOW TIME FOR LUNCHEON SHE OPENED HER LITTLE BASKET AND ATE OF THE BREAD AND CHEESE AND COOKIES SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER AFTER SHE HAD FINISHED HER MEAL AND TAKEN A DRINK OF COOL WATER FROM A SPRING NEAR BY
289-121665-0024 SHE DECIDED SHE WOULD NOT WAIT ANY LONGER SO UP SHE TOOK HER LITTLE CROOK DETERMINED FOR TO FIND THEM AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL WHEN SHE GOT TO THE TOP THERE WAS NEVER A SIGHT OF SHEEP ABOUT
289-121665-0025 ONLY A GREEN VALLEY AND ANOTHER HILL BEYOND NOW REALLY ALARMED FOR THE SAFETY OF HER CHARGE BO PEEP HURRIED INTO THE VALLEY AND UP THE FARTHER HILL SIDE PANTING AND TIRED SHE REACHED THE SUMMIT AND PAUSING BREATHLESSLY
289-121665-0026 GAZED BELOW HER QUIETLY FEEDING UPON THE RICH GRASS WAS HER TRUANT FLOCK LOOKING AS PEACEFUL AND INNOCENT AS IF IT HAD NEVER STRAYED AWAY FROM ITS GENTLE SHEPHERDESS BO PEEP UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND HURRIED TOWARD THEM
289-121665-0027 BUT WHEN SHE CAME NEAR SHE STOPPED IN AMAZEMENT AND HELD UP HER LITTLE HANDS WITH A PRETTY EXPRESSION OF DISMAY SHE HAD FOUND THEM INDEED BUT IT MADE HER HEART BLEED
289-121665-0028 NOTHING WAS LEFT TO EACH SHEEP BUT A WEE LITTLE STUMP WHERE A TAIL SHOULD BE AND LITTLE BO PEEP WAS SO HEART BROKEN THAT SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE THEM AND SOBBED BITTERLY
289-121665-0029 BUT AFTER AWHILE THE TINY MAID REALIZED THAT ALL HER TEARS WOULD NOT BRING BACK THE TAILS TO HER LAMBKINS SO SHE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND DRIED HER EYES AND AROSE FROM THE GROUND JUST AS THE OLD WOMAN HOBBLED UP TO HER
289-121665-0030 SO YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR SHEEP DEARIE SHE SAID IN HER CRACKED VOICE YES REPLIED LITTLE BO PEEP WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING A SOB BUT LOOK MOTHER THEY VE ALL LEFT THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM WHY SO THEY HAVE EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN
289-121665-0031 AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH AS IF SOMETHING PLEASED HER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HAS BECOME OF THEIR TAILS ASKED THE GIRL OH SOME ONE HAS PROBABLY CUT THEM OFF THEY MAKE NICE TIPPETS IN WINTER TIME YOU KNOW
289-121665-0032 AND THEN SHE PATTED THE CHILD UPON HER HEAD AND WALKED AWAY DOWN THE VALLEY BO PEEP WAS MUCH GRIEVED OVER THE LOSS THAT HAD BEFALLEN HER DEAR SHEEP AND SO DRIVING THEM BEFORE HER SHE WANDERED AROUND TO SEE IF BY ANY CHANCE SHE COULD FIND THE LOST TAILS
289-121665-0033 BUT SOON THE SUN BEGAN TO SINK OVER THE HILL TOPS AND SHE KNEW SHE MUST TAKE HER SHEEP HOME BEFORE NIGHT OVERTOOK THEM SHE DID NOT TELL HER MOTHER OF HER MISFORTUNE FOR SHE FEARED THE OLD SHEPHERDESS WOULD SCOLD HER
289-121665-0034 AND BO PEEP HAD FULLY DECIDED TO SEEK FOR THE TAILS AND FIND THEM BEFORE SHE RELATED THE STORY OF THEIR LOSS TO ANYONE EACH DAY FOR MANY DAYS AFTER THAT LITTLE BO PEEP WANDERED ABOUT THE HILLS SEEKING THE TAILS OF HER SHEEP
289-121665-0035 AND THOSE WHO MET HER WONDERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MAKE THE SWEET LITTLE MAID SO ANXIOUS BUT THERE IS AN END TO ALL TROUBLES NO MATTER HOW SEVERE THEY MAY SEEM TO BE AND IT HAPPENED ONE DAY AS BO PEEP DID STRAY UNTO A MEADOW HARD BY
289-121665-0036 THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS DISCOVERY AND REACHING UP HER CROOK SHE KNOCKED THE ROW OF PRETTY WHITE TAILS OFF THE TREE AND GATHERED THEM UP IN HER FROCK BUT HOW TO FASTEN THEM ONTO HER SHEEP AGAIN WAS THE QUESTION
289-121665-0037 AND AFTER PONDERING THE MATTER FOR A TIME SHE BECAME DISCOURAGED AND THINKING SHE WAS NO BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE THE TAILS WERE FOUND SHE BEGAN TO WEEP AND TO BEWAIL HER MISFORTUNE BUT AMIDST HER TEARS SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF HER NEEDLE AND THREAD
289-121665-0038 WHY SHE EXCLAIMED SMILING AGAIN I CAN SEW THEM ON OF COURSE THEN SHE HEAVED A SIGH AND WIPED HER EYE AND RAN O'ER HILL AND DALE OH AND TRIED WHAT SHE COULD AS A SHEPHERDESS SHOULD TO TACK TO EACH SHEEP ITS TAIL OH
289-121665-0039 BUT THE VERY FIRST SHEEP SHE CAME TO REFUSED TO ALLOW HER TO SEW ON THE TAIL AND RAN AWAY FROM HER AND THE OTHERS DID THE SAME SO THAT FINALLY SHE WAS UTTERLY DISCOURAGED SHE WAS BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN WHEN THE SAME OLD WOMAN SHE HAD BEFORE MET
289-121665-0040 CAME HOBBLING TO HER SIDE AND ASKED WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY CAT TAILS YOUR CAT TAILS REPLIED BO PEEP IN SURPRISE WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY THESE TAILS ARE ALL CUT FROM WHITE PUSSYCATS AND I PUT THEM ON THE TREE TO DRY
289-121665-0041 WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THEM I THOUGHT THEY BELONGED TO MY SHEEP ANSWERED BO PEEP SORROWFULLY
289-121665-0042 I MUST HUNT UNTIL I FIND THOSE THAT BELONG TO MY SHEEP MY DEAR SAID THE OLD WOMAN I HAVE BEEN DECEIVING YOU YOU SAID YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT YOUR SHEEP AND I WANTED TO TEACH YOU A LESSON FOR HOWEVER WISE WE MAY BE
289-121665-0043 NO ONE IN THIS WORLD KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING SHEEP DO NOT HAVE LONG TAILS THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE STUMP TO ANSWER FOR A TAIL NEITHER DO RABBITS HAVE TAILS NOR BEARS NOR MANY OTHER ANIMALS
289-121665-0044 AND IF YOU HAD BEEN OBSERVING YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL THIS WHEN I SAID THE SHEEP WOULD BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AND THEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED ALL THOSE DAYS IN SEARCHING FOR WHAT IS NOT TO BE FOUND
289-121665-0045 SO NOW LITTLE ONE RUN AWAY HOME AND TRY TO BE MORE THOUGHTFUL IN THE FUTURE YOUR SHEEP WILL NEVER MISS THE TAILS
289-121665-0046 AND NOW LITTLE BO PEEP NO MORE DID WEEP MY TALE OF TAILS ENDS HERE
