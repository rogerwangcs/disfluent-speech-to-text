1040-133433-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN WHEN WENDY GREW UP I HOPE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THE OTHER BOYS THEY WERE WAITING BELOW TO GIVE WENDY TIME TO EXPLAIN ABOUT THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD COUNTED FIVE HUNDRED THEY WENT UP
1040-133433-0001 THEY WENT UP BY THE STAIR BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE A BETTER IMPRESSION THEY STOOD IN A ROW IN FRONT OF MISSUS DARLING WITH THEIR HATS OFF AND WISHING THEY WERE NOT WEARING THEIR PIRATE CLOTHES THEY SAID NOTHING BUT THEIR EYES ASKED HER TO HAVE THEM
1040-133433-0002 BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT HIM OF COURSE MISSUS DARLING SAID AT ONCE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE THEM BUT MISTER DARLING WAS CURIOUSLY DEPRESSED AND THEY SAW THAT HE CONSIDERED SIX A RATHER LARGE NUMBER I MUST SAY HE SAID TO WENDY
1040-133433-0003 THAT YOU DON'T DO THINGS BY HALVES A GRUDGING REMARK WHICH THE TWINS THOUGHT WAS POINTED AT THEM THE FIRST TWIN WAS THE PROUD ONE AND HE ASKED FLUSHING DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE TOO MUCH OF A HANDFUL SIR BECAUSE IF SO WE CAN GO AWAY
1040-133433-0004 FATHER WENDY CRIED SHOCKED BUT STILL THE CLOUD WAS ON HIM HE KNEW HE WAS BEHAVING UNWORTHILY BUT HE COULD NOT HELP IT WE COULD LIE DOUBLED UP SAID NIBS I ALWAYS CUT THEIR HAIR MYSELF SAID WENDY
1040-133433-0005 GEORGE MISSUS DARLING EXCLAIMED PAINED TO SEE HER DEAR ONE SHOWING HIMSELF IN SUCH AN UNFAVOURABLE LIGHT THEN HE BURST INTO TEARS AND THE TRUTH CAME OUT HE WAS AS GLAD TO HAVE THEM AS SHE WAS HE SAID
1040-133433-0006 BUT HE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE ASKED HIS CONSENT AS WELL AS HERS
1040-133433-0007 I DON'T THINK HE IS A CYPHER TOOTLES CRIED INSTANTLY DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER CURLY NO I DON'T DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER SLIGHTLY RATHER NOT TWIN WHAT DO YOU THINK
1040-133433-0008 IT TURNED OUT THAT NOT ONE OF THEM THOUGHT HIM A CYPHER AND HE WAS ABSURDLY GRATIFIED AND SAID HE WOULD FIND SPACE FOR THEM ALL IN THE DRAWING ROOM IF THEY FITTED IN WE'LL FIT IN SIR THEY ASSURED HIM THEN FOLLOW THE LEADER HE CRIED GAILY
1040-133433-0009 MIND YOU I AM NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE A DRAWING ROOM BUT WE PRETEND WE HAVE AND IT'S ALL THE SAME HOOP LA HE WENT OFF DANCING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL CRIED HOOP LA AND DANCED AFTER HIM SEARCHING FOR THE DRAWING ROOM AND I FORGET WHETHER THEY FOUND IT
1040-133433-0010 BUT AT ANY RATE THEY FOUND CORNERS AND THEY ALL FITTED IN AS FOR PETER HE SAW WENDY ONCE AGAIN BEFORE HE FLEW AWAY HE DID NOT EXACTLY COME TO THE WINDOW BUT HE BRUSHED AGAINST IT IN PASSING SO THAT SHE COULD OPEN IT IF SHE LIKED AND CALL TO HIM
1040-133433-0011 THAT IS WHAT SHE DID HULLO WENDY GOOD BYE HE SAID OH DEAR ARE YOU GOING AWAY YES YOU DON'T FEEL PETER SHE SAID FALTERINGLY
1040-133433-0012 THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING TO MY PARENTS ABOUT A VERY SWEET SUBJECT NO ABOUT ME PETER NO MISSUS DARLING CAME TO THE WINDOW
1040-133433-0013 WOULD YOU SEND ME TO SCHOOL HE INQUIRED CRAFTILY YES AND THEN TO AN OFFICE I SUPPOSE SO
1040-133433-0014 VERY SOON I DON'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL AND LEARN SOLEMN THINGS HE TOLD HER PASSIONATELY I DON'T WANT TO BE A MAN O WENDY'S MOTHER IF I WAS TO WAKE UP AND FEEL THERE WAS A BEARD PETER SAID WENDY THE COMFORTER I SHOULD LOVE YOU IN A BEARD
1040-133433-0015 AND MISSUS DARLING STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS TO HIM BUT HE REPULSED HER KEEP BACK LADY
1040-133433-0016 BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE WITH TINK IN THE HOUSE WE BUILT FOR WENDY THE FAIRIES ARE TO PUT IT HIGH UP AMONG THE TREE TOPS WHERE THEY SLEEP AT NIGHTS HOW LOVELY CRIED WENDY SO LONGINGLY THAT MISSUS DARLING TIGHTENED HER GRIP I THOUGHT ALL THE FAIRIES WERE DEAD MISSUS DARLING SAID
1040-133433-0017 BECAUSE YOU SEE WHEN A NEW BABY LAUGHS FOR THE FIRST TIME A NEW FAIRY IS BORN AND AS THERE ARE ALWAYS NEW BABIES THERE ARE ALWAYS NEW FAIRIES THEY LIVE IN NESTS ON THE TOPS OF TREES AND THE MAUVE ONES ARE BOYS AND THE WHITE ONES ARE GIRLS AND THE BLUE ONES ARE JUST LITTLE SILLIES WHO ARE NOT SURE WHAT THEY ARE
1040-133433-0018 I SHALL HAVE TINK TINK CAN'T GO A TWENTIETH PART OF THE WAY ROUND SHE REMINDED HIM A LITTLE TARTLY
1040-133433-0019 TINK CALLED OUT FROM SOMEWHERE ROUND THE CORNER IT DOESN'T MATTER PETER SAID O PETER YOU KNOW IT MATTERS
1040-133433-0020 MAY I MUMMY CERTAINLY NOT I HAVE GOT YOU HOME AGAIN AND I MEAN TO KEEP YOU BUT HE DOES SO NEED A MOTHER SO DO YOU MY LOVE OH ALL RIGHT PETER SAID AS IF HE HAD ASKED HER FROM POLITENESS MERELY
1040-133433-0021 LONG IN COMING BUT THIS PROMISE SENT PETER AWAY QUITE GAY AGAIN
1040-133433-0022 I SUPPOSE IT WAS BECAUSE WENDY KNEW THIS THAT HER LAST WORDS TO HIM WERE THESE RATHER PLAINTIVE ONES YOU WON'T FORGET ME PETER WILL YOU BEFORE SPRING CLEANING TIME COMES OF COURSE PETER PROMISED AND THEN HE FLEW AWAY HE TOOK MISSUS DARLING'S KISS WITH HIM
1040-133433-0023 THE KISS THAT HAD BEEN FOR NO ONE ELSE PETER TOOK QUITE EASILY FUNNY BUT SHE SEEMED SATISFIED OF COURSE ALL THE BOYS WENT TO SCHOOL
1040-133433-0024 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE NOW AND SOON THEY SETTLED DOWN TO BEING AS ORDINARY AS YOU OR ME OR JENKINS MINOR
1040-133433-0025 IN TIME THEY COULD NOT EVEN FLY AFTER THEIR HATS WANT OF PRACTICE THEY CALLED IT BUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANT WAS THAT THEY NO LONGER BELIEVED MICHAEL BELIEVED LONGER THAN THE OTHER BOYS
1040-133433-0026 THOUGH THEY JEERED AT HIM SO HE WAS WITH WENDY WHEN PETER CAME FOR HER AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR SHE FLEW AWAY WITH PETER IN THE FROCK SHE HAD WOVEN FROM LEAVES AND BERRIES IN THE NEVERLAND AND HER ONE FEAR WAS THAT HE MIGHT NOTICE HOW SHORT IT HAD BECOME BUT HE NEVER NOTICED HE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT HIMSELF
1040-133433-0027 SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THRILLING TALKS WITH HIM ABOUT OLD TIMES BUT NEW ADVENTURES HAD CROWDED THE OLD ONES FROM HIS MIND WHO IS CAPTAIN HOOK
1040-133433-0028 WHEN SHE SPOKE OF THE ARCH ENEMY DON'T YOU REMEMBER SHE ASKED AMAZED HOW YOU KILLED HIM AND SAVED ALL OUR LIVES I FORGET THEM AFTER I KILL THEM HE REPLIED CARELESSLY WHEN SHE EXPRESSED A DOUBTFUL HOPE THAT TINKER BELL WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER HE SAID
1040-133433-0029 WHO IS TINKER BELL O PETER SHE SAID SHOCKED BUT EVEN WHEN SHE EXPLAINED HE COULD NOT REMEMBER THERE ARE SUCH A LOT OF THEM HE SAID I EXPECT SHE IS NO MORE I EXPECT HE WAS RIGHT FOR FAIRIES DON'T LIVE LONG
1040-133433-0030 BUT THEY ARE SO LITTLE THAT A SHORT TIME SEEMS A GOOD WHILE TO THEM WENDY WAS PAINED TOO TO FIND THAT THE PAST YEAR WAS BUT AS YESTERDAY TO PETER
1040-133433-0031 BUT HE WAS EXACTLY AS FASCINATING AS EVER AND THEY HAD A LOVELY SPRING CLEANING IN THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE TREE TOPS NEXT YEAR HE DID NOT COME FOR HER SHE WAITED IN A NEW FROCK BECAUSE THE OLD ONE SIMPLY WOULD NOT MEET BUT HE NEVER CAME
1040-133433-0032 PERHAPS HE IS ILL MICHAEL SAID YOU KNOW HE IS NEVER ILL MICHAEL CAME CLOSE TO HER AND WHISPERED WITH A SHIVER PERHAPS THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON WENDY AND THEN WENDY WOULD HAVE CRIED IF MICHAEL HAD NOT BEEN CRYING
1040-133433-0033 PETER CAME NEXT SPRING CLEANING AND THE STRANGE THING WAS THAT HE NEVER KNEW HE HAD MISSED A YEAR THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THE GIRL WENDY EVER SAW HIM FOR A LITTLE LONGER SHE TRIED FOR HIS SAKE NOT TO HAVE GROWING PAINS
1040-133433-0034 AND SHE FELT SHE WAS UNTRUE TO HIM WHEN SHE GOT A PRIZE FOR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE BUT THE YEARS CAME AND WENT WITHOUT BRINGING THE CARELESS BOY AND WHEN THEY MET AGAIN WENDY WAS A MARRIED WOMAN AND PETER WAS NO MORE TO HER
1040-133433-0035 THAN A LITTLE DUST IN THE BOX IN WHICH SHE HAD KEPT HER TOYS WENDY WAS GROWN UP YOU NEED NOT BE SORRY FOR HER SHE WAS ONE OF THE KIND THAT LIKES TO GROW UP IN THE END SHE GREW UP OF HER OWN FREE WILL A DAY QUICKER THAN OTHER GIRLS
1040-133433-0036 ALL THE BOYS WERE GROWN UP AND DONE FOR BY THIS TIME SO IT IS SCARCELY WORTH WHILE SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM YOU MAY SEE THE TWINS AND NIBS AND CURLY ANY DAY GOING TO AN OFFICE EACH CARRYING A LITTLE BAG AND AN UMBRELLA
1040-133433-0037 YOU SEE THAT JUDGE IN A WIG COMING OUT AT THE IRON DOOR THAT USED TO BE TOOTLES THE BEARDED MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY STORY TO TELL HIS CHILDREN
1040-133433-0038 AND ALWAYS HAD AN ODD INQUIRING LOOK
1040-133433-0039 WHEN SHE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO ASK THEM THEY WERE MOSTLY ABOUT PETER PAN SHE LOVED TO HEAR OF PETER AND WENDY TOLD HER ALL SHE COULD REMEMBER IN THE VERY NURSERY FROM WHICH THE FAMOUS FLIGHT HAD TAKEN PLACE
1040-133433-0040 WHO WAS NO LONGER FOND OF STAIRS MISSUS DARLING WAS NOW DEAD AND FORGOTTEN THERE WERE ONLY TWO BEDS IN THE NURSERY NOW JANE'S AND HER NURSE'S AND THERE WAS NO KENNEL FOR NANA ALSO HAD PASSED AWAY
1040-133433-0041 SHE DIED OF OLD AGE AND AT THE END SHE HAD BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET ON WITH BEING VERY FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT NO ONE KNEW HOW TO LOOK AFTER CHILDREN EXCEPT HERSELF ONCE A WEEK JANE'S NURSE HAD HER EVENING OFF
1040-133433-0042 AND THEN IT WAS WENDY'S PART TO PUT JANE TO BED THAT WAS THE TIME FOR STORIES IT WAS JANE'S INVENTION TO RAISE THE SHEET OVER HER MOTHER'S HEAD AND HER OWN THUS MAKING A TENT
1040-133433-0043 I DON'T THINK I SEE ANYTHING TO NIGHT SAYS WENDY WITH A FEELING THAT IF NANA WERE HERE SHE WOULD OBJECT TO FURTHER CONVERSATION YES YOU DO SAYS JANE
1040-133433-0044 THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO SWEETHEART SAYS WENDY AH ME HOW TIME FLIES DOES IT FLY ASKS THE ARTFUL CHILD THE WAY YOU FLEW WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL
1040-133433-0045 WHY CAN'T YOU FLY NOW MOTHER BECAUSE I AM GROWN UP DEAREST WHEN PEOPLE GROW UP THEY FORGET THE WAY WHY DO THEY FORGET THE WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS
1040-133433-0046 IT IS ONLY THE GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS WHO CAN FLY WHAT IS GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS
1040-133433-0047 OR PERHAPS WENDY ADMITS SHE DOES SEE SOMETHING I DO BELIEVE SHE SAYS THAT IT IS THIS NURSERY I DO BELIEVE IT IS SAYS JANE GO ON
1040-133433-0048 THEY ARE NOW EMBARKED ON THE GREAT ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN PETER FLEW IN LOOKING FOR HIS SHADOW
1040-133433-0049 YOU HAVE MISSED A BIT INTERRUPTS JANE WHO NOW KNOWS THE STORY BETTER THAN HER MOTHER WHEN YOU SAW HIM SITTING ON THE FLOOR CRYING WHAT DID YOU SAY I SAT UP IN BED AND I SAID BOY WHY ARE YOU CRYING
1040-133433-0050 YES THAT WAS IT SAYS JANE WITH A BIG BREATH AND THEN HE FLEW US ALL AWAY TO THE NEVERLAND AND THE FAIRIES AND THE PIRATES AND THE REDSKINS AND THE MERMAID'S LAGOON
1040-133433-0051 YES WHICH DID YOU LIKE BEST OF ALL I THINK I LIKED THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND BEST OF ALL
1040-133433-0052 WHAT WAS THE LAST THING PETER EVER SAID TO YOU THE LAST THING HE EVER SAID TO ME WAS JUST ALWAYS BE WAITING FOR ME AND THEN SOME NIGHT YOU WILL HEAR ME CROWING YES BUT ALAS HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT ME
1040-133433-0053 WENDY SAID IT WITH A SMILE SHE WAS AS GROWN UP AS THAT WHAT DID HIS CROW SOUND LIKE JANE ASKED ONE EVENING IT WAS LIKE THIS WENDY SAID
1040-133433-0054 TRYING TO IMITATE PETER'S CROW NO IT WASN'T JANE SAID GRAVELY
1040-133433-0055 JANE SAID AH YES MANY GIRLS HEAR IT WHEN THEY ARE SLEEPING BUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD IT AWAKE LUCKY YOU SAID JANE AND THEN ONE NIGHT CAME THE TRAGEDY IT WAS THE SPRING OF THE YEAR
1040-133433-0056 WENDY WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR VERY CLOSE TO THE FIRE SO AS TO SEE TO DARN FOR THERE WAS NO OTHER LIGHT IN THE NURSERY AND WHILE SHE SAT DARNING SHE HEARD A CROW THEN THE WINDOW BLEW OPEN AS OF OLD
1040-133433-0057 HE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVER AND WENDY SAW AT ONCE THAT HE STILL HAD ALL HIS FIRST TEETH HE WAS A LITTLE BOY AND SHE WAS GROWN UP SHE HUDDLED BY THE FIRE NOT DARING TO MOVE HELPLESS AND GUILTY
1040-133433-0058 A BIG WOMAN HULLO WENDY HE SAID NOT NOTICING ANY DIFFERENCE FOR HE WAS THINKING CHIEFLY OF HIMSELF AND IN THE DIM LIGHT HER WHITE DRESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NIGHTGOWN IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER FIRST HULLO PETER
1040-133433-0059 SHE REPLIED FAINTLY SQUEEZING HERSELF AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE SOMETHING INSIDE HER WAS CRYING WOMAN WOMAN LET GO OF ME HULLO WHERE IS JOHN HE ASKED SUDDENLY MISSING THE THIRD BED
1040-133433-0060 JOHN IS NOT HERE NOW SHE GASPED IS MICHAEL ASLEEP HE ASKED WITH A CARELESS GLANCE AT JANE
1040-133433-0061 THAT IS NOT MICHAEL SHE SAID QUICKLY LEST A JUDGMENT SHOULD FALL ON HER PETER LOOKED HULLO IS IT A NEW ONE YES BOY OR GIRL GIRL NOW SURELY HE WOULD UNDERSTAND BUT NOT A BIT OF IT
1040-133433-0062 PETER SHE SAID FALTERING ARE YOU EXPECTING ME TO FLY AWAY WITH YOU OF COURSE THAT IS WHY I HAVE COME HE ADDED A LITTLE STERNLY HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT THIS IS SPRING CLEANING TIME
1040-133433-0063 SHE KNEW IT WAS USELESS TO SAY THAT HE HAD LET MANY SPRING CLEANING TIMES PASS I CAN'T COME SHE SAID APOLOGETICALLY I HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO FLY I'LL SOON TEACH YOU AGAIN O PETER DON'T WASTE THE FAIRY DUST ON ME
1040-133433-0064 WHAT IS IT HE CRIED SHRINKING
1040-133433-0065 FOR ALMOST THE ONLY TIME IN HIS LIFE THAT I KNOW OF PETER WAS AFRAID DON'T TURN UP THE LIGHT HE CRIED SHE LET HER HANDS PLAY IN THE HAIR OF THE TRAGIC BOY SHE WAS NOT A LITTLE GIRL HEART BROKEN ABOUT HIM
1040-133433-0066 SHE WAS A GROWN WOMAN SMILING AT IT ALL
1040-133433-0067 THEN SHE TURNED UP THE LIGHT AND PETER SAW HE GAVE A CRY OF PAIN AND WHEN THE TALL BEAUTIFUL CREATURE STOOPED TO LIFT HIM IN HER ARMS HE DREW BACK SHARPLY WHAT IS IT HE CRIED AGAIN SHE HAD TO TELL HIM
1040-133433-0068 I AM OLD PETER I AM EVER SO MUCH MORE THAN TWENTY I GREW UP LONG AGO YOU PROMISED NOT TO I COULDN'T HELP IT
1040-133433-0069 NO YOU'RE NOT YES AND THE LITTLE GIRL IN THE BED IS MY BABY NO SHE'S NOT
1040-133433-0070 OF COURSE HE DID NOT STRIKE
1040-133433-0071 AND WENDY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO COMFORT HIM THOUGH SHE COULD HAVE DONE IT SO EASILY ONCE SHE WAS ONLY A WOMAN NOW AND SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM TO TRY TO THINK PETER CONTINUED TO CRY AND SOON HIS SOBS WOKE JANE
1040-133433-0072 BOY SHE SAID WHY ARE YOU CRYING PETER ROSE AND BOWED TO HER AND SHE BOWED TO HIM FROM THE BED HULLO HE SAID HULLO SAID JANE MY NAME IS PETER PAN HE TOLD HER
1040-133433-0073 YES I KNOW I CAME BACK FOR MY MOTHER HE EXPLAINED TO TAKE HER TO THE NEVERLAND YES I KNOW JANE SAID I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU WHEN WENDY RETURNED DIFFIDENTLY SHE FOUND PETER SITTING ON THE BED POST CROWING GLORIOUSLY
1040-133433-0074 WHILE JANE IN HER NIGHTY WAS FLYING ROUND THE ROOM IN SOLEMN ECSTASY SHE IS MY MOTHER PETER EXPLAINED AND JANE DESCENDED AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE WITH THE LOOK IN HER FACE THAT HE LIKED TO SEE ON LADIES WHEN THEY GAZED AT HIM
1040-133433-0075 HE DOES SO NEED A MOTHER JANE SAID YES I KNOW WENDY ADMITTED RATHER FORLORNLY NO ONE KNOWS IT SO WELL AS I GOOD BYE SAID PETER TO WENDY AND HE ROSE IN THE AIR AND THE SHAMELESS JANE ROSE WITH HIM
1040-133433-0076 IT WAS ALREADY HER EASIEST WAY OF MOVING ABOUT WENDY RUSHED TO THE WINDOW NO NO SHE CRIED IT IS JUST FOR SPRING CLEANING TIME JANE SAID HE WANTS ME ALWAYS TO DO HIS SPRING CLEANING
1040-133433-0077 IF ONLY I COULD GO WITH YOU WENDY SIGHED YOU SEE YOU CAN'T FLY SAID JANE OF COURSE IN THE END WENDY LET THEM FLY AWAY TOGETHER

118-124588-0000 MISSUS SAVAREEN SAT UP WAITING FOR HER LORD UNTIL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT BUT HER VIGIL WAS IN VAIN LAPIERRE AFTER CLOSING UP HIS INN FOR THE NIGHT DROPPED IN ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO SEE IF ANY NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE HAD ARRIVED
118-124588-0001 NOTHING FURTHER COULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF SEARCHING FOR THE LATTER PERSONAGE UNTIL DAYLIGHT IT WAS GETTING ON PRETTY WELL TOWARDS MORNING WHEN MISSUS SAVAREEN SOUGHT HER COUCH AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE HER SLUMBER WAS BROKEN AND DISTURBED SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK
118-124588-0002 BUT SHE WAS HAUNTED BY A DREAD THAT SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN SEE HER HUSBAND ALIVE NEXT MORNING SOON AFTER DAYLIGHT THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ASTIR AND THE COUNTRY ROUND WAS CAREFULLY SEARCHED FOR ANY TRACE OF THE MISSING MAN
118-124588-0003 SQUIRE HARRINGTON WENT DOWN TO TOWN AND MADE INQUIRIES AT THE BANK WHERE HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE STORY TOLD BY SAVAREEN TO OLD JONATHAN PERRY
118-124588-0004 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT THIS EFFECTUALLY DISPOSED OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY AS TO JONATHAN AND HIS WIFE HAVING MISTAKEN SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SAVAREEN SQUIRE HARRINGTON LIKEWISE LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE MAN'S DOINGS ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
118-124588-0005 AND WAS ABLE TO FIX THE TIME AT WHICH HE HAD STARTED FOR HOME HE HAD RIDDEN FROM THE DOOR OF THE PEACOCK AT ABOUT A QUARTER TO EIGHT
118-124588-0006 PERRY PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN AND CONVERSED WITH HIM THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT INTERVIEW AND CONVERSATION HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND SAVAREEN HAD RIDDEN NORTHWARD FROM THE GATE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE COULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED
118-124588-0007 OR AT THE VERY OUTSIDE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER OR HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY LAPIERRE
118-124588-0008 BUT THE HORSE WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER IT SEEMED IMPROBABLE THAT TWO LIVING SUBSTANCES OF SUCH BULK SHOULD PASS OUT OF BEING AND LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND THEM THEY MUST LITERALLY HAVE MELTED INTO THIN AIR NO THEY HADN'T AT LEAST THE BLACK MARE HADN'T
118-124588-0009 FOR SHE WAS DISCOVERED BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SEARCHING PARTY A LITTLE BEFORE NOON WHEN FOUND SHE WAS QUIETLY CROPPING THE DAMP HERBAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE CRANBERRY SWAMP AT THE REAR OF SQUIRE HARRINGTON'S FARM SHE WAS WHOLLY UNINJURED AND HAD EVIDENTLY SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
118-124588-0010 THE BIT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM HER MOUTH BUT THE BRIDLE HUNG INTACT ROUND HER NECK THE SADDLE HOWEVER LIKE ITS OWNER HAD DISAPPEARED FROM HER BACK THEN THE MEN BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SWAMP THEY SOON CAME UPON THE SADDLE WHICH HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DELIBERATELY UNBUCKLED
118-124588-0011 AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
118-124588-0012 AS BELONG TO SAVAREEN IT WAS WET AND BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND IN FACT WAS LYING HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A LITTLE PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN IT WAS FOUND THEN THE SEARCHERS MADE SURE OF FINDING THE BODY BUT IN THIS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED
118-124588-0013 BUT FOUND NOTHING FURTHER TO REWARD THEIR SEARCH THE GROUND WAS TOO SOFT AND MARSHY TO RETAIN ANY TRACES OF FOOTSTEPS AND THE MARE AND SADDLE FURNISHED THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST HAD BEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SWAMP AND OF COURSE THIS EVIDENCE WAS OF THE MOST VAGUE AND INCONCLUSIVE CHARACTER
118-124588-0014 THEN THE PARTY PROCEEDED IN A BODY TO THE MISSING MAN'S HOUSE HERE ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED THEM THE COAT WAS AT ONCE RECOGNISED BY MISSUS SAVAREEN AS BELONGING TO HER HUSBAND BUT IT WAS NOT THE COAT WORN BY HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS THERE WAS NO DOUBT WHATEVER
118-124588-0015 IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY
118-124588-0016 THE SEARCH WAS KEPT UP WITHOUT INTERMISSION FOR SEVERAL DAYS NEARLY ALL OF THE FARMERS IN THE VICINITY TAKING PART IN IT EVEN TO THE NEGLECT OF THE HARVEST WORK WHICH DEMANDED THEIR ATTENTION SQUIRE HARRINGTON WAS ESPECIALLY ACTIVE AND LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY
118-124588-0017 LAPIERRE GAVE UP ALL HIS TIME TO THE SEARCH AND LEFT THE ROYAL OAK TO THE CARE OF ITS LANDLADY THE LOCAL CONSTABULARY BESTIRRED THEMSELVES AS THEY HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE
118-124588-0018 WHERE A MAN'S BODY MIGHT POSSIBLY LIE CONCEALED EVERY TRACT OF BUSH AND WOODLAND EVERY BARN AND OUT BUILDING EVERY HOLLOW AND DITCH EVERY FIELD AND FENCE CORNER WAS EXPLORED WITH CAREFUL MINUTENESS EVEN THE WELLS OF THE DISTRICT WERE PEERED INTO
118-124588-0019 FROM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH DOCTOR SCOTT THE LOCAL CORONER HELD HIMSELF IN READINESS TO SUMMON A CORONER'S JURY AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE WHEN ALL THESE MEASURES PROVED UNAVAILING A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE INHABITANTS WAS CONVENED AND FUNDS WERE SUBSCRIBED TO STILL FURTHER PROSECUTE THE SEARCH
118-124588-0020 DEAD OR ALIVE OR WHICH SHOULD THROW ANY LIGHT UPON HIS FATE HAND BILLS PROCLAIMING THIS REWARD AND DESCRIBING THE MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE WERE EXHIBITED IN EVERY BAR ROOM AND OTHER CONSPICUOUS PLACE THROUGHOUT WESTCHESTER AND THE ADJACENT TOWNSHIPS

118-47824-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD BOBBY RETURNED TO HIS BED HE LAY THERE STILL SHIVERING BENEATH THE HEAVY BLANKETS I DON'T DARE HE ECHOED GRAHAM'S WORDS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ANY ONE CAN SAY
118-47824-0001 I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
118-47824-0002 ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO LEARN HOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE APPARENT MIRACLES
118-47824-0003 THE WOMAN AT THE LAKE AND IN THE COURTYARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THE VANISHING OF THE EVIDENCE UNDER HIS HAND PAREDES'S ODD BEHAVIOUR ALL BECAME IN HIS MIND PUZZLING DETAILS THAT FAILED TO OBSCURE THE CHIEF FACT
118-47824-0004 AFTER THIS SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT PAREDES'S DETENTION HE HADN'T DREAMED THAT HIS WEARINESS COULD PLACATE EVEN MOMENTARILY SUCH REFLECTIONS BUT AT LAST HE SLEPT AGAIN
118-47824-0005 HE WAS AROUSED BY THE TRAMPING OF MEN AROUND THE HOUSE AND STRANGE HARSH VOICES HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND GLANCED FROM THE WINDOW IT HAD LONG BEEN DAYLIGHT TWO BURLY FELLOWS IN OVERALLS CARRYING PICK AND SPADE ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
118-47824-0006 PUSHED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING HE TURNED GRAHAM FULLY DRESSED STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE BED THOSE MEN BOBBY ASKED WEARILY THE GRAVE DIGGERS GRAHAM ANSWERED THEY ARE GOING TO WORK IN THE OLD CEMETERY TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR SILAS BLACKBURN
118-47824-0007 THAT'S WHY I'VE COME TO WAKE YOU UP THE MINISTER'S TELEPHONED KATHERINE HE WILL BE HERE BEFORE NOON DO YOU KNOW IT'S AFTER TEN O'CLOCK FOR SOME TIME BOBBY STARED THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE DESOLATE RAGGED LANDSCAPE IT WAS ABNORMALLY COLD EVEN FOR THE LATE FALL
118-47824-0008 DULL CLOUDS OBSCURED THE SUN AND FURNISHED AN ILLUSION OF CROWDING EARTHWARD A FUNEREAL DAY THE WORDS SLIPPED INTO HIS MIND HE REPEATED THEM WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER'S BURIED GRAHAM ANSWERED SOFTLY WE'LL ALL FEEL HAPPIER WHY BOBBY ASKED
118-47824-0009 IT WON'T LESSEN THE FACT OF HIS MURDER TIME GRAHAM SAID LESSENS SUCH FACTS EVEN FOR THE POLICE BOBBY GLANCED AT HIM FLUSHING YOU MEAN YOU'VE DECIDED TO STAND BY ME AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT GRAHAM SMILED
118-47824-0010 I SLEPT LIKE A TOP LAST NIGHT I HEARD NOTHING I SAW NOTHING OUGHT I TO WANT YOU TO STAND BY ME BOBBY SAID OUGHTN'T I TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
118-47824-0011 GRAHAM FROWNED IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH YOUR SLEEP WALKING LAST NIGHT YET IT'S AS CLEAR AS EVER THAT MARIA AND HE ARE UP TO SOME GAME IN WHICH YOU FIGURE HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL BOBBY PERSISTED GET UP GRAHAM ADVISED
118-47824-0012 BATHE AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST THEN WE CAN DECIDE THERE'S NO USE TALKING OF THE OTHER THING I'VE FORGOTTEN IT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE YOU MUST BOBBY SPRANG UPRIGHT HOW CAN I FORGET IT
118-47824-0013 HAVE I ANY RIGHT DON'T GRAHAM SAID I'LL BE WITH YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT
118-47824-0014 WHEN BOBBY HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HE FOUND IN SPITE OF HIS MENTAL TURMOIL THAT HIS SLEEP HAD DONE HIM GOOD WHILE HE BREAKFASTED GRAHAM URGED HIM TO EAT TRIED TO DRIVE FROM HIS BRAIN THE MORBID AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S REVEALING MOMENT
118-47824-0015 THE MANAGER TOOK MY ADVICE BUT MARIA'S STILL MISSING
118-47824-0016 HE STROLLED OVER AND HANDED BOBBY A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS WHERE'S ROBINSON BOBBY ASKED I SAW HIM IN THE COURT A WHILE AGO I DARESAY HE'S WANDERING AROUND PERHAPS WATCHING THE MEN AT THE GRAVE HE LEARNED NOTHING NEW LAST NIGHT I WAS WITH HIM AT BREAKFAST I GATHER NOT
118-47824-0017 BOBBY LOOKED UP ISN'T THAT AN AUTOMOBILE COMING THROUGH THE WOODS HE ASKED MAYBE RAWLINS BACK FROM SMITHTOWN OR THE MINISTER THE CAR STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE COURT THEY HEARD THE REMOTE TINKLING OF THE FRONT DOOR BELL JENKINS PASSED THROUGH
118-47824-0018 HIS SHARP EXCLAMATION RECALLED HOWELLS'S REPORT WHICH AT THEIR DIRECTION HE HAD FAILED TO MAIL HAD HIS EXCLAMATION BEEN DRAWN BY AN ACCUSER BOBBY STARTED TO RISE GRAHAM MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR THEN JENKINS ENTERED AND STOOD TO ONE SIDE
118-47824-0019 THE FORMER EASY MANNERED UNCOMMUNICATIVE FOREIGNER HE APPEARED MOREOVER TO HAVE SLEPT PLEASANTLY HIS EYES SHOWED NO WEARINESS HIS CLOTHING NO DISARRANGEMENT HE SPOKE AT ONCE
118-47824-0020 OVERCOAT I'VE NEARLY FROZEN DRIVING FROM SMITHTOWN BEFORE EITHER MAN COULD GROPE FOR A SUITABLE GREETING HE FACED BOBBY
118-47824-0021 FACT IS BOBBY I LEFT NEW YORK TOO SUDDENLY
118-47824-0022 YOU SEE I SPENT A GOOD DEAL IN SMITHTOWN YESTERDAY
118-47824-0023 GRAHAM INTERRUPTED WITH A FLAT DEMAND FOR AN EXPLANATION HOW DID YOU GET AWAY
118-47824-0024 LATER MISTER GRAHAM THERE IS A HACK DRIVER OUTSIDE WHO IS EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN YOU HE WANTS TO BE PAID I ASKED RAWLINS TO DRIVE ME BACK BUT HE RUSHED FROM THE COURTHOUSE PROBABLY TO TELEPHONE HIS ROTUND SUPERIOR
118-47824-0025 BOBBY HANDED HIM A BANKNOTE HE DIDN'T MISS GRAHAM'S MEANING GLANCE
118-47824-0026 PAY HIM WILL YOU JENKINS THANKS
118-47824-0027 WHY HE SHOULD FAIL TO REFER TO BOBBY'S QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST OR TO THE OPENLY EXPRESSED ENMITY OF GRAHAM ONLY ONE THEORY PROMISED TO FIT AT ALL IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PANAMANIAN TO RETURN TO THE CEDARS
118-47824-0028 COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN FOR THE PRESENT IN THE MOURNFUL TRAGIC HOUSE THEREFORE HE WOULD CRUSH HIS JUSTIFIABLE ANGER
118-47824-0029 AND HE HAD ASKED FOR MONEY ONLY A TRIFLING SUM YET GRAHAM WOULD GRASP AT THE FACT TO SUPPORT HIS EARLIER SUSPICION PAREDES'S ARRIVAL POSSESSED ONE VIRTUE IT DIVERTED BOBBY'S THOUGHTS TEMPORARILY FROM HIS OWN DILEMMA FROM HIS INABILITY TO CHART A COURSE
118-47824-0030 GRAHAM ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ILL AT EASE
118-47824-0031 FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
118-47824-0032 WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
118-47824-0033 SIMPLE ENOUGH MISTER GRAHAM I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS RAWLINS GOT ME TO THE BASTILLE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I ONCE WORKED HE'S A PROMINENT AND BRILLIANT MAN HE PLANNED IT WITH SOME LOCAL FELLOW WHEN I WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OPENING OF COURT THIS MORNING
118-47824-0034 THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
118-47824-0035 I DON'T MIND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OUT OF IT
118-47824-0036 YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
118-47824-0037 HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
118-47824-0038 HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
118-47824-0039 ROBINSON ENTERED THE FLESH AROUND HIS EYES WAS PUFFIER THAN IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY WORRY HAD INCREASED THE INCONGRUOUS DISCONTENT OF HIS ROUND FACE CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT LITTLE I SAW YOU ARRIVE HE SAID RAWLINS WARNED ME
118-47824-0040 BUT I MUST SAY I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D USE YOUR FREEDOM TO COME TO US
118-47824-0041 SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
118-47824-0042 THAT FLEETING SATANIC IMPRESSION OF YESTERDAY CAME BACK SHARPER MORE ALARMING PAREDES'S CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS STRENGTH HIS MIND WAS SUBTLER THAN THEIRS
118-47824-0043 HIS RESERVE AND EASY DARING MASTERED THEM ALL AND ALWAYS AS NOW HE LAUGHED AT THE FUTILITY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO SOUND HIS PURPOSES TO LIMIT HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION BOBBY DIDN'T CARE TO MEET THE UNCOMMUNICATIVE EYES WHOSE DEPTHS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE
118-47824-0044 THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
118-47824-0045 AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
118-47824-0046 ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
118-47824-0047 NO HURRY BOBBY ANSWERED WITH A QUICK INTAKE OF BREATH I SUPPOSE NOT ROBINSON SNEERED SINCE EVERYBODY KNOWS WELL ENOUGH WHAT'S IN IT BOBBY AROSE ROBINSON STILL SNEERED YOU'LL BE AT THE GRAVE AS CHIEF MOURNER
118-47824-0048 BOBBY WALKED FROM THE ROOM HE HADN'T CARED TO REPLY HE FEARED AS IT WAS THAT HE HAD LET SLIP HIS INCREASED SELF DOUBT HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT AND LEFT THE HOUSE THE RAW COLD THE YEAR'S FIRST OMEN OF WINTER MADE HIS BLOOD RUN QUICKER
118-47824-0049 FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
118-47824-0050 THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
118-47824-0051 FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
118-47824-0052 THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
118-47824-0053 IN ITSELF BEAST LIKE AND UNNATURAL AT LAST A HARSH VOICE CAME TO BOBBY ITS BREVITY POINTED THE PREVIOUS DUMBNESS OF THE SPEAKER DEEP ENOUGH AND BOBBY TURNED AND HURRIED BACK ALONG THE ROUGHLY RESTORED PATH
118-47824-0054 AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
118-47824-0055 THERE WAS AN IRONICAL JUSTICE IN THE CONDITION OF THE OLD CEMETERY IT HAD RECEIVED NO INTERMENT SINCE THE DEATH OF KATHERINE'S FATHER LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CEDARS SILAS BLACKBURN HAD DELIVERED IT TO THE SWIFT OBLITERATING FINGERS OF TIME
118-47824-0056 IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
118-47824-0057 HE WOULD HAVE GUARDED WITH A MORE PRECIOUS INTEREST THE DRAPINGS OF HIS FINAL SLEEP THIS NECESSARY TASK ON WHICH BOBBY HAD STUMBLED HAD MADE THE THICKET LESS CONGENIAL THAN THE HOUSE AS HE WALKED BACK HE FORECASTED WITH A KEEN APPREHENSION HIS APPROACHING ORDEAL
118-47824-0058 COULD HE WITNESS THE DEFINITE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS GRANDFATHER IN A NARROW BOX COULD HE WATCH THE COVERING EARTH FALL NOISILY IN THAT BLEAK PLACE OF SILENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING FOR ROBINSON
118-47824-0059 A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
118-47824-0060 SUCH A FIGURE WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE CEDARS
118-47824-0061 HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
118-47824-0062 NO LIKELY PATH YET WHOSE CROSSING IS THE PRICE OF SALVATION HE WAS GLAD TO SEE GRAHAM LEAVE THE COURT AND HURRY TOWARD HIM I WAS COMING TO HUNT YOU UP BOBBY THE MINISTER'S ARRIVED SO HAS DOCTOR GROOM EVERYTHING'S ABOUT READY DOCTOR GROOM
118-47824-0063 IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD
118-47824-0064 HE ASKED HE IGNORES WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN THE CEDARS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT BOBBY ANSWERED THIS MORNING CARLOS GAVE ME THE CREEPS
118-47824-0065 HE SPOKE WITH PRONOUNCED DELIBERATION STARTLING BOBBY
118-47824-0066 GAVE ME THE CREEPS TOO MAKES ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE HAS AN ABOMINABLY DEEP PURPOSE IN USING HIS WITS TO HANG ON HERE HE SUGGESTS RESOURCES AS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OLD ROOM YOU'LL CONFESS BOBBY HE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INFLUENCE OVER YOU AN INFLUENCE FOR EVIL
118-47824-0067 I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
118-47824-0068 I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
118-47824-0069 ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
118-47824-0070 NO I WON'T BELIEVE IT I'VE BEEN WEAK HARTLEY BUT NOT THAT WEAK AND I TELL YOU I DID FEEL HOWELLS'S BODY MOVE UNDER MY HAND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME GRAHAM SAID GENTLY I MUST CONSIDER EVERY POSSIBILITY YOU WERE EXCITED AND IMAGINATIVE WHEN YOU WENT TO THE OLD ROOM TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE
118-47824-0071 MIGHT HAVE MOVED SPASMODICALLY I MEAN
118-47824-0072 AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EVIDENCE BOBBY DEFENDED HIMSELF IF IT HAD BEEN STOLEN EARLIER THE COAT POCKET MIGHT HAVE RETAINED ITS BULGING SHAPE
118-47824-0073 BUT I WAS THERE AND YOU WEREN'T
118-47824-0074 IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
118-47824-0075 HE GLANCED AWAY WHILE THE ANGRY COLOUR LEFT HIS FACE HE WAS A LITTLE DAZED BY THE REALIZATION THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO GRAHAM AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO AN ENEMY AS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HOWELLS IN THE OLD BEDROOM HE FELT THE TOUCH OF GRAHAM'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER I'M ONLY WORKING IN YOUR SERVICE GRAHAM SAID KINDLY
118-47824-0076 FOR GROOM HAS BROUGHT THE GHOSTS BACK WITH HIM DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THE TRUTH DON'T YOU YES BOBBY SAID EVEN IF IT DOES FOR ME
118-47824-0077 YET THAT FLASH OF TEMPER HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO FACE THE ORDEAL A LINGERING RESENTMENT AT GRAHAM'S SUGGESTION LESSENED THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION ENTERING THE COURT HE SCARCELY GLANCED AT THE BLACK WAGON THERE WERE MORE DARK CLOTHED MEN IN THE HALL RAWLINS HAD RETURNED
118-47824-0078 THE PANAMANIAN HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHING HE TOO WAS SOMBRELY DRESSED AND INSTEAD OF THE VIVID NECKTIE HE HAD WORN FROM THE COURTHOUSE A JET BLACK SCARF WAS PERFECTLY ARRANGED BENEATH HIS COLLAR HE LOUNGED OPPOSITE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
118-47824-0079 HIS EYES STUDYING THE FIRE HIS FINGERS ON THE CHAIR ARM WERE RESTLESS DOCTOR GROOM STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN A STOUT AND UNCTUOUS FIGURE
118-47824-0080 FROM HIS THICKLY BEARDED FACE HIS REDDISH EYES GLEAMED FORTH WITH A FRESH INSTABILITY THE CLERGYMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOBBY WE NEED NOT DELAY YOUR COUSIN IS UPSTAIRS HE INCLUDED THE COMPANY IN HIS CIRCLING TURN OF THE HEAD ANY ONE WHO CARES TO GO
118-47824-0081 BOBBY FORCED HIMSELF TO WALK UP THE STAIRCASE FACING THE FIRST PHASE OF HIS ORDEAL HE SAW THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY REALIZED THAT TOO FOR HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND FOLLOWED BY RAWLINS STARTED UPWARD THE ENTIRE COMPANY CROWDED THE STAIRS
118-47824-0082 GRAHAM SUMMONED KATHERINE ONE OF THE BLACK CLOTHED MEN OPENED THE DOOR OF SILAS BLACKBURN'S ROOM HE STEPPED ASIDE BECKONING
118-47824-0083 BOBBY WENT IN WITH THE OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT HE CATALOGUED REMEMBERED OBJECTS ALL INTIMATE TO HIS GRANDFATHER EACH ODDLY ENTANGLED IN HIS MIND WITH HIS DISLIKE OF THE OLD MAN THE IRON BED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS
118-47824-0084 SCRATCHED AND WITH BROKEN HANDLES THE CLOSED COLONIAL DESK THE MISERLY RAG CARPET ALL SEEMED MUTELY ASKING AS BOBBY DID
118-47824-0085 FROM THE CHEST OF DRAWERS TWO CANDLES THE ONLY LIGHT
118-47824-0086 SO FOR THE SECOND TIME THE LIVING MET THE DEAD AND THE LAW WATCHED HOPEFULLY
1246-124548-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE SHE TRIED TO BE CONTENT WHICH WAS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS SHE FANATICALLY CLEANED HOUSE ALL APRIL SHE KNITTED A SWEATER FOR HUGH SHE WAS DILIGENT AT RED CROSS WORK
1246-124548-0001 SHE WAS SILENT WHEN VIDA RAVED THAT THOUGH AMERICA HATED WAR AS MUCH AS EVER WE MUST INVADE GERMANY AND WIPE OUT EVERY MAN BECAUSE IT WAS NOW PROVEN THAT THERE WAS NO SOLDIER IN THE GERMAN ARMY WHO WAS NOT CRUCIFYING PRISONERS
1246-124548-0002 VERY OLD AND WEAK WHO A FEW DECADES AGO HAD BEEN BOYS AND GIRLS OF THE FRONTIER RIDING BRONCOS THROUGH THE RANK WINDY GRASS OF THIS PRAIRIE THEY HOBBLED BEHIND A BAND MADE UP OF BUSINESS MEN AND HIGH SCHOOL BOYS

1246-124548-0008 LYMAN CASS GAVE CHAMP A WARM BERTH AS NIGHT WATCHMAN
1246-124548-0009 HE WAS WELL BUT STILL WEAK FROM HAVING BEEN GASSED HE HAD BEEN DISCHARGED AND HE CAME HOME AS THE FIRST OF THE WAR VETERANS IT WAS RUMORED THAT HE SURPRISED VIDA BY COMING UNANNOUNCED THAT VIDA FAINTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM AND FOR A NIGHT AND DAY

1246-124548-0041 COME ON YOU TWIN CITIES OUR HAT IS IN THE RING
1246-124548-0042 A RED HEADED YOUNG MAN WHO SMOKED CIGARETTES IN A LONG AMBER HOLDER CAROL READ THE BOOKLET WITH A CERTAIN WONDER
1246-124548-0043 SHE LEARNED THAT PLOVER AND MINNIEMASHIE LAKES WERE WORLD FAMED FOR THEIR BEAUTEOUS WOODED SHORES AND GAMEY PIKE AND BASS NOT TO BE EQUALLED ELSEWHERE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT THE RESIDENCES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE WERE MODELS
1246-124548-0044 OF DIGNITY COMFORT AND CULTURE WITH LAWNS AND GARDENS KNOWN FAR AND WIDE THAT THE GOPHER PRAIRIE SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC LIBRARY IN ITS NEAT AND COMMODIOUS BUILDING WERE CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THE GOPHER PRAIRIE MILLS MADE THE
1246-124548-0045 BEST FLOUR IN THE COUNTRY THAT THE SURROUNDING FARM LANDS WERE RENOWNED
1246-124548-0046 AND THAT THE STORES IN GOPHER PRAIRIE COMPARED FAVORABLY WITH MINNEAPOLIS AND CHICAGO IN THEIR ABUNDANCE OF LUXURIES AND NECESSITIES AND THE EVER COURTEOUS ATTENTION OF THE SKILLED CLERKS SHE LEARNED IN BRIEF
1246-124548-0047 THAT THIS WAS THE ONE LOGICAL LOCATION FOR FACTORIES AND WHOLESALE HOUSES
1246-124548-0048 KENNICOTT WAS TRIUMPHANT WHEN THE COMMERCIAL CLUB DID CAPTURE ONE SMALL SHY FACTORY WHICH PLANNED TO MAKE WOODEN AUTOMOBILE WHEELS BUT WHEN CAROL SAW THE PROMOTER
1246-124548-0049 SHE COULD NOT FEEL THAT HIS COMING MUCH MATTERED AND A YEAR AFTER WHEN HE FAILED SHE COULD NOT BE VERY SORROWFUL
1246-124548-0050 BUT CAROL COULD DISCOVER NO MORE PICTURES NOR INTERESTING FOOD NOR GRACIOUS VOICES NOR AMUSING CONVERSATION NOR QUESTING MINDS SHE COULD SHE ASSERTED ENDURE A SHABBY BUT MODEST TOWN
1246-124548-0051 THE TOWN SHABBY AND EGOMANIAC SHE COULD NOT ENDURE SHE COULD NURSE CHAMP PERRY AND WARM TO THE NEIGHBORLINESS OF SAM CLARK BUT SHE COULD NOT SIT APPLAUDING HONEST JIM BLAUSSER
1246-124550-0000 THOUGH THE ARMISTICE WITH GERMANY WAS SIGNED A FEW WEEKS AFTER HER COMING TO WASHINGTON THE WORK OF THE BUREAU CONTINUED SHE FILED CORRESPONDENCE ALL DAY THEN SHE DICTATED ANSWERS TO LETTERS OF INQUIRY IT WAS AN ENDURANCE OF MONOTONOUS DETAILS
1246-124550-0001 YET SHE ASSERTED THAT SHE HAD FOUND REAL WORK DISILLUSIONS SHE DID HAVE SHE DISCOVERED THAT IN THE AFTERNOON OFFICE ROUTINE STRETCHES TO THE GRAVE SHE DISCOVERED THAT AN OFFICE IS AS FULL OF CLIQUES AND SCANDALS AS A GOPHER PRAIRIE
1246-124550-0002 A FREE SUNDAY IT DID NOT APPEAR THAT THE GREAT WORLD NEEDED HER INSPIRATION BUT SHE FELT THAT HER LETTERS HER CONTACT WITH THE ANXIETIES OF MEN AND WOMEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WERE A PART OF VAST AFFAIRS
1246-124550-0003 NOT CONFINED TO MAIN STREET AND A KITCHEN BUT LINKED WITH PARIS BANGKOK MADRID SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE COULD DO OFFICE WORK WITHOUT LOSING ANY OF THE PUTATIVE FEMININE VIRTUE OF DOMESTICITY THAT COOKING AND CLEANING
1246-124550-0004 NOT TO HAVE TO REPORT TO KENNICOTT AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL THAT SHE HAD DONE OR MIGHT DO WAS A RELIEF WHICH MADE UP FOR THE OFFICE WEARINESS SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER ONE HALF OF A MARRIAGE
1246-124550-0005 WHITE COLUMNS SEEN ACROSS LEAFY PARKS SPACIOUS AVENUES TWISTY ALLEYS DAILY SHE PASSED A DARK SQUARE HOUSE WITH A HINT OF MAGNOLIAS AND A COURTYARD BEHIND IT AND A TALL CURTAINED SECOND STORY WINDOW THROUGH WHICH A WOMAN WAS ALWAYS PEERING
1246-124550-0006 THE WOMAN WAS MYSTERY ROMANCE A STORY WHICH TOLD ITSELF DIFFERENTLY EVERY DAY NOW SHE WAS A MURDERESS NOW THE NEGLECTED WIFE OF AN AMBASSADOR IT WAS MYSTERY WHICH CAROL HAD MOST LACKED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE
1246-124550-0007 WHERE EVERY HOUSE WAS OPEN TO VIEW WHERE EVERY PERSON WAS BUT TOO EASY TO MEET WHERE THERE WERE NO SECRET GATES OPENING UPON MOORS OVER WHICH ONE MIGHT WALK BY MOSS DEADENED PATHS TO STRANGE HIGH ADVENTURES IN AN ANCIENT GARDEN
1246-124550-0008 AS SHE FLITTED UP SIXTEENTH STREET AFTER A KREISLER RECITAL GIVEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON FOR THE GOVERNMENT CLERKS AS THE LAMPS KINDLED IN SPHERES OF SOFT FIRE AS THE BREEZE FLOWED INTO THE STREET FRESH AS PRAIRIE WINDS AND KINDLIER
1246-124550-0009 AS SHE GLANCED UP THE ELM ALLEY OF MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE AS SHE WAS RESTED BY THE INTEGRITY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE TEMPLE SHE LOVED THE CITY AS SHE LOVED NO ONE SAVE HUGH SHE ENCOUNTERED NEGRO SHANTIES TURNED INTO STUDIOS
1246-124550-0010 WITH ORANGE CURTAINS AND POTS OF MIGNONETTE MARBLE HOUSES ON NEW HAMPSHIRE AVENUE WITH BUTLERS AND LIMOUSINES AND MEN WHO LOOKED LIKE FICTIONAL EXPLORERS AND AVIATORS HER DAYS WERE SWIFT AND SHE KNEW THAT IN HER FOLLY OF RUNNING AWAY
1246-124550-0011 WERE THE MEMBERS OF THE TINCOMB METHODIST CHURCH A VAST RED BRICK TABERNACLE VIDA SHERWIN HAD GIVEN HER A LETTER TO AN EARNEST WOMAN WITH EYE GLASSES PLAID SILK WAIST AND A BELIEF IN BIBLE CLASSES WHO INTRODUCED HER TO THE PASTOR AND THE
1246-124550-0012 THEY WENT TO SUNDAY SERVICE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR MISSIONARY LECTURES CHURCH SUPPERS PRECISELY AS THEY HAD AT HOME THEY AGREED THAT AMBASSADORS AND FLIPPANT NEWSPAPERMEN AND INFIDEL SCIENTISTS OF THE BUREAUS
1246-124550-0013 WERE EQUALLY WICKED AND TO BE AVOIDED AND BY CLEAVING TO TINCOMB CHURCH THEY KEPT THEIR IDEALS FROM ALL CONTAMINATION THEY WELCOMED CAROL ASKED ABOUT HER HUSBAND GAVE HER ADVICE REGARDING COLIC IN BABIES
1246-124550-0014 PASSED HER THE GINGERBREAD AND SCALLOPED POTATOES AT CHURCH SUPPERS AND IN GENERAL MADE HER VERY UNHAPPY AND LONELY SO THAT SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENLIST IN THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE ORGANIZATION AND BE ALLOWED TO GO TO JAIL
1246-124550-0015 ALWAYS SHE WAS TO PERCEIVE IN WASHINGTON AS DOUBTLESS SHE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED IN NEW YORK OR LONDON A THICK STREAK OF MAIN STREET THE CAUTIOUS DULLNESS OF A GOPHER PRAIRIE APPEARED IN BOARDING HOUSES WHERE LADYLIKE BUREAU CLERKS
1246-124550-0016 ABOUT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR THE CAPTAIN INTRODUCED HER TO THE SECRETARY OF A CONGRESSMAN A CYNICAL YOUNG WIDOW WITH MANY ACQUAINTANCES IN THE NAVY THROUGH HER CAROL MET COMMANDERS AND MAJORS NEWSPAPERMEN
1246-124550-0017 CHEMISTS AND GEOGRAPHERS AND FISCAL EXPERTS FROM THE BUREAUS AND A TEACHER WHO WAS A FAMILIAR OF THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE HEADQUARTERS THE TEACHER TOOK HER TO HEADQUARTERS CAROL NEVER BECAME A PROMINENT SUFFRAGIST
1246-124550-0018 INDEED HER ONLY RECOGNIZED POSITION WAS AS AN ABLE ADDRESSER OF ENVELOPES BUT SHE WAS CASUALLY ADOPTED BY THIS FAMILY OF FRIENDLY WOMEN WHO WHEN THEY WERE NOT BEING MOBBED OR ARRESTED TOOK DANCING LESSONS OR WENT PICNICKING UP THE CHESAPEAKE CANAL
1246-124550-0019 THOUGH IT ABSORBED MOST OF HER SALARY AN EXCELLENT NURSE FOR HUGH SHE HERSELF PUT HIM TO BED AND PLAYED WITH HIM ON HOLIDAYS THERE WERE WALKS WITH HIM THERE WERE MOTIONLESS EVENINGS OF READING BUT CHIEFLY WASHINGTON WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE
1246-124550-0020 SCORES OF THEM SITTING ABOUT THE FLAT TALKING TALKING TALKING NOT ALWAYS WISELY BUT ALWAYS EXCITEDLY IT WAS NOT AT ALL THE ARTIST'S STUDIO OF WHICH BECAUSE OF ITS PERSISTENCE IN FICTION SHE HAD DREAMED
1246-124550-0021 BUT THEY PLAYED VERY SIMPLY AND THEY SAW NO REASON WHY ANYTHING WHICH EXISTS CANNOT ALSO BE ACKNOWLEDGED SHE WAS SOMETIMES SHOCKED QUITE AS SHE HAD SHOCKED GOPHER PRAIRIE BY THESE GIRLS WITH THEIR CIGARETTES AND ELFISH KNOWLEDGE
1246-124550-0022 THE PRESENCE OF HUGH MADE HER FEEL TEMPORARY SOME DAY OH SHE'D HAVE TO TAKE HIM BACK TO OPEN FIELDS AND THE RIGHT TO CLIMB ABOUT HAY LOFTS BUT THE FACT THAT SHE COULD NEVER BE EMINENT AMONG THESE SCOFFING ENTHUSIASTS
1246-124550-0023 DID NOT KEEP HER FROM BEING PROUD OF THEM FROM DEFENDING THEM IN IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH KENNICOTT WHO GRUNTED SHE COULD HEAR HIS VOICE THEY'RE SIMPLY A BUNCH OF WILD IMPRACTICAL THEORISTS SITTIN ROUND CHEWING THE RAG AND
1246-124550-0024 THE ACCEPTANCE OF WOMEN WITHOUT EMBARRASSED BANTER FOR WHICH SHE HAD LONGED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE YET THEY SEEMED TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS THE SAM CLARKS SHE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE OF SECURE REPUTATION NOT HEMMED IN BY THE FIRE OF PROVINCIAL JEALOUSIES
1246-124550-0025 KENNICOTT HAD ASSERTED THAT THE VILLAGER'S LACK OF COURTESY IS DUE TO HIS POVERTY WE'RE NO MILLIONAIRE DUDES HE BOASTED YET THESE ARMY AND NAVY MEN THESE BUREAU EXPERTS AND ORGANIZERS OF MULTITUDINOUS LEAGUES
1246-124550-0026 THAT INSTITUTION IS RESERVED FOR MEN LIKE KENNICOTT WHO AFTER DEVOTING FIFTY YEARS TO PUTTING ASIDE A STAKE INCONTINENTLY INVEST THE STAKE IN SPURIOUS OIL STOCKS
1246-124550-0027 SHE FOUND THE SAME FAITH NOT ONLY IN GIRLS ESCAPED FROM DOMESTICITY BUT ALSO IN DEMURE OLD LADIES WHO TRAGICALLY DEPRIVED OF ESTEEMED HUSBANDS AND HUGE OLD HOUSES
1246-124550-0028 YET MANAGED TO MAKE A VERY COMFORTABLE THING OF IT BY LIVING IN SMALL FLATS AND HAVING TIME TO READ BUT SHE ALSO LEARNED THAT BY COMPARISON GOPHER PRAIRIE WAS A MODEL OF DARING COLOR CLEVER PLANNING AND FRENZIED INTELLECTUALITY
1246-124550-0029 FROM HER TEACHER HOUSEMATE SHE HAD A SARDONIC DESCRIPTION OF A MIDDLEWESTERN RAILROAD DIVISION TOWN OF THE SAME SIZE AS GOPHER PRAIRIE BUT DEVOID OF LAWNS AND TREES A TOWN WHERE THE TRACKS SPRAWLED ALONG THE CINDER SCABBED MAIN STREET AND THE RAILROAD SHOPS
1246-124550-0030 DRIPPING SOOT FROM EAVES AND DOORWAY ROLLED OUT SMOKE IN GREASY COILS OTHER TOWNS SHE CAME TO KNOW BY ANECDOTE A PRAIRIE VILLAGE WHERE THE WIND BLEW ALL DAY LONG AND THE MUD WAS TWO FEET THICK IN SPRING AND IN SUMMER
1246-124550-0031 NEW ENGLAND MILL TOWNS WITH THE HANDS LIVING IN ROWS OF COTTAGES LIKE BLOCKS OF LAVA A RICH FARMING CENTER IN NEW JERSEY OFF THE RAILROAD FURIOUSLY PIOUS RULED BY OLD MEN UNBELIEVABLY IGNORANT OLD MEN
1246-124550-0032 SITTING ABOUT THE GROCERY TALKING OF JAMES G BLAINE A SOUTHERN TOWN FULL OF THE MAGNOLIAS AND WHITE COLUMNS WHICH CAROL HAD ACCEPTED AS PROOF OF ROMANCE BUT HATING THE NEGROES OBSEQUIOUS TO THE OLD FAMILIES
1246-124550-0033 A WESTERN MINING SETTLEMENT LIKE A TUMOR A BOOMING SEMI CITY WITH PARKS AND CLEVER ARCHITECTS VISITED BY FAMOUS PIANISTS AND UNCTUOUS LECTURERS BUT IRRITABLE FROM A STRUGGLE BETWEEN UNION LABOR AND THE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
1246-124550-0034 THE LINES ARE BROKEN AND UNCERTAIN OF DIRECTION OFTEN INSTEAD OF RISING THEY SINK IN WAVERING SCRAWLS AND THE COLORS ARE WATERY BLUE AND PINK AND THE DIM GRAY OF RUBBED PENCIL MARKS A FEW LINES ARE TRACEABLE
1246-124550-0035 UNHAPPY WOMEN ARE GIVEN TO PROTECTING THEIR SENSITIVENESS BY CYNICAL GOSSIP BY WHINING BY HIGH CHURCH AND NEW THOUGHT RELIGIONS OR BY A FOG OF VAGUENESS CAROL HAD HIDDEN IN NONE OF THESE REFUGES FROM REALITY
1246-124550-0036 BUT SHE WHO WAS TENDER AND MERRY HAD BEEN MADE TIMOROUS BY GOPHER PRAIRIE EVEN HER FLIGHT HAD BEEN BUT THE TEMPORARY COURAGE OF PANIC THE THING SHE GAINED IN WASHINGTON WAS NOT INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICE SYSTEMS AND LABOR UNIONS BUT RENEWED COURAGE
1246-124550-0037 THAT AMIABLE CONTEMPT CALLED POISE HER GLIMPSE OF TASKS INVOLVING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND A SCORE OF NATIONS REDUCED MAIN STREET FROM BLOATED IMPORTANCE TO ITS ACTUAL PETTINESS SHE COULD NEVER AGAIN BE QUITE SO AWED BY THE POWER
1246-124550-0038 SHE CAUGHT SOMETHING OF AN IMPERSONAL ATTITUDE SAW THAT SHE HAD BEEN AS TOUCHILY PERSONAL AS MAUD DYER AND WHY SHE BEGAN TO ASK DID SHE RAGE AT INDIVIDUALS NOT INDIVIDUALS BUT INSTITUTIONS ARE THE ENEMIES
1246-124550-0039 AND THEY MOST AFFLICT THE DISCIPLES WHO THE MOST GENEROUSLY SERVE THEM
1246-135815-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN JOHNNY CHUCK JOINS THE CLASS
1246-135815-0001 PETER RABBIT DELIVERED MOTHER NATURE'S MESSAGE TO JOHNNY CHUCK JOHNNY DIDN'T SEEM AT ALL PLEASED HE GRUMBLED AND GROWLED TO HIMSELF HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT HIS RELATIVES
1246-135815-0002 HE WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH THINGS AS THEY WERE THE TRUTH IS JOHNNY CHUCK WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GET FAT WITH GOOD LIVING AND HE IS NATURALLY LAZY AS A RULE HE CAN FIND PLENTY TO EAT VERY NEAR HIS HOME
1246-135815-0003 SO HE SELDOM GOES FAR FROM HIS OWN DOORSTEP PETER LEFT HIM GRUMBLING AND GROWLING AND CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH HE KNEW THAT JOHNNY CHUCK WOULD NOT DARE DISOBEY OLD MOTHER NATURE
1246-135815-0004 SURE ENOUGH THE NEXT MORNING JOHNNY CHUCK CAME WADDLING THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST JUST AS OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS ABOUT TO OPEN SCHOOL HE DIDN'T LOOK AT ALL HAPPY AND HE DIDN'T REPLY AT ALL TO THE GREETINGS OF THE OTHERS

1246-135815-0012 PETER WAS DELIGHTED TO AIR HIS KNOWLEDGE THE LAST ONE I WAS IN SAID HE WAS A LONG TUNNEL SLANTING DOWN FOR QUITE A DISTANCE AND THEN STRAIGHTENING OUT THE ENTRANCE WAS QUITE LARGE WITH A BIG HEAP OF SAND OUT IN FRONT OF IT
1246-135815-0013 DOWN A LITTLE WAY THE TUNNEL GREW SMALLER AND THEN REMAINED THE SAME SIZE ALL THE REST OF THE WAY WAY DOWN AT THE FARTHER END WAS A NICE LITTLE BEDROOM WITH SOME GRASS IN IT THERE WERE ONE OR TWO OTHER LITTLE ROOMS
1246-135815-0014 AND THERE WERE TWO BRANCH TUNNELS LEADING UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND MAKING SIDE OR BACK DOORWAYS THERE WAS NO SAND AROUND EITHER OF THESE AND THEY WERE QUITE HIDDEN BY THE LONG GRASS HANGING OVER THEM
1246-135815-0015 THOSE BACK DOORWAYS ARE VERY HANDY IN TIME OF DANGER DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE THREE DOORWAYS ASKED HAPPY JACK
1246-135815-0016 AND ONCE IN A WHILE ONLY ONE BUT THAT ISN'T REALLY SAFE

1246-135815-0023 AND TO MORROW I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THEM IF YOU WANT ME TO
1246-135815-0024 JOHNNY CHUCK HUNG HIS HEAD FOR HE WAS A LITTLE ASHAMED THAT HE HAD BEEN SO UNWILLING TO COME THAT MORNING IF YOU PLEASE MOTHER NATURE SAID HE I THINK I'LL COME I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD ANY CLOSE RELATIVES AND I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
1624-142933-0000 PETER SEES ROSEBREAST AND FINDS REDCOAT
1624-142933-0001 WHO'S THAT PETER RABBIT PRICKED UP HIS LONG EARS AND STARED UP AT THE TOPS OF THE TREES OF THE OLD ORCHARD INSTANTLY JENNY WREN POPPED HER HEAD OUT OF HER DOORWAY SHE COCKED HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE TO LISTEN
1624-142933-0002 THEN LOOKED DOWN AT PETER AND HER SHARP LITTLE EYES SNAPPED I DON'T HEAR ANY STRANGE VOICE SAID SHE THE WAY YOU ARE STARING PETER RABBIT ONE WOULD THINK THAT YOU HAD REALLY HEARD SOMETHING NEW AND WORTH WHILE
1624-142933-0003 JUST THEN THERE WERE TWO OR THREE RATHER SHARP SQUEAKY NOTES FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TREES THERE CRIED PETER THERE DIDN'T YOU HEAR THAT JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0004 FOR GOODNESS SAKE PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU DON'T KNOW WHOSE VOICE THAT IS SHE CRIED THAT'S ROSEBREAST HE AND MISSUS ROSEBREAST HAVE BEEN HERE FOR QUITE A LITTLE WHILE
1624-142933-0005 I DIDN'T SUPPOSE THERE WAS ANY ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW THOSE SHARP SQUEAKY VOICES THEY RATHER GET ON MY NERVES WHAT ANYBODY WANTS TO SQUEAK LIKE THAT FOR WHEN THEY CAN SING AS ROSEBREAST CAN IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
1624-142933-0006 AT THAT VERY INSTANT MISTER WREN BEGAN TO SCOLD AS ONLY HE AND JENNY CAN PETER LOOKED UP AT JENNY AND WINKED SLYLY AND WHAT ANYBODY WANTS TO SCOLD LIKE THAT FOR WHEN THEY CAN SING AS MISTER WREN CAN IS TOO MUCH FOR ME
1624-142933-0007 RETORTED PETER BUT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHO ROSEBREAST IS THE GROSBEAK OF COURSE STUPID SPUTTERED JENNY IF YOU DON'T KNOW ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK PETER RABBIT YOU CERTAINLY MUST HAVE BEEN BLIND AND DEAF EVER SINCE YOU WERE BORN
1624-142933-0008 LISTEN TO THAT JUST LISTEN TO THAT SONG PETER LISTENED THERE WERE MANY SONGS FOR IT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MORNING AND ALL THE SINGERS OF THE OLD ORCHARD WERE POURING OUT THE JOY THAT WAS WITHIN THEM
1624-142933-0009 ONE SONG WAS A LITTLE LOUDER AND CLEARER THAN THE OTHERS BECAUSE IT CAME FROM A TREE VERY CLOSE AT HAND THE VERY TREE FROM WHICH THOSE SQUEAKY NOTES HAD COME JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE PETER SUSPECTED THAT THAT MUST BE THE SONG JENNY WREN MEANT HE LOOKED PUZZLED
1624-142933-0010 HE WAS PUZZLED DO YOU MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG HE ASKED RATHER SHEEPISHLY FOR HE HAD A FEELING THAT HE WOULD BE THE VICTIM OF JENNY WREN'S SHARP TONGUE NO I DON'T MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG SNAPPED JENNY
1624-142933-0011 WHAT GOOD ARE A PAIR OF LONG EARS IF THEY CAN'T TELL ONE SONG FROM ANOTHER THAT SONG MAY SOUND SOMETHING LIKE WELCOME ROBIN'S BUT IF YOUR EARS WERE GOOD FOR ANYTHING AT ALL YOU'D KNOW RIGHT AWAY THAT THAT ISN'T WELCOME ROBIN SINGING
1624-142933-0012 THAT'S A BETTER SONG THAN WELCOME ROBIN'S WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG IS ONE OF GOOD CHEER BUT THIS ONE IS OF PURE HAPPINESS I WOULDN'T HAVE A PAIR OF EARS LIKE YOURS FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0013 PETER LAUGHED RIGHT OUT AS HE TRIED TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF JENNY WREN WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE HIS WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT DEMANDED JENNY CROSSLY DON'T YOU DARE LAUGH AT ME
1624-142933-0014 IF THERE IS ANY ONE THING I CAN'T STAND IT IS BEING LAUGHED AT I WASN'T LAUGHING AT YOU REPLIED PETER VERY MEEKLY I WAS JUST LAUGHING AT THE THOUGHT OF HOW FUNNY YOU WOULD LOOK WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE MINE
1624-142933-0015 NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT JENNY THAT SONG IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WELCOME ROBIN'S OF COURSE IT IS RETORTED JENNY THAT IS ROSEBREAST SINGING UP THERE AND THERE HE IS RIGHT IN THE TOP OF THAT TREE
1624-142933-0016 ISN'T HE HANDSOME PETER LOOKED UP TO SEE A BIRD A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS HEAD THROAT AND BACK WERE BLACK HIS WINGS WERE BLACK WITH PATCHES OF WHITE ON THEM
1624-142933-0017 BUT IT WAS HIS BREAST THAT MADE PETER CATCH HIS BREATH WITH A LITTLE GASP OF ADMIRATION FOR THAT BREAST WAS A BEAUTIFUL ROSE RED THE REST OF HIM UNDERNEATH WAS WHITE IT WAS ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK ISN'T HE LOVELY
1624-142933-0018 CRIED PETER AND ADDED IN THE NEXT BREATH WHO IS THAT WITH HIM MISSUS GROSBEAK OF COURSE WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE SPUTTERED JENNY RATHER CROSSLY FOR SHE WAS STILL A LITTLE PUT OUT BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN LAUGHED AT
1624-142933-0019 SAID PETER SHE DOESN'T LOOK THE LEAST BIT LIKE HIM THIS WAS QUITE TRUE THERE WAS NO BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR ABOUT MISSUS GROSBEAK SHE WAS DRESSED CHIEFLY IN BROWN AND GRAYISH COLORS WITH A LITTLE BUFF HERE AND THERE AND WITH DARK STREAKS ON HER BREAST
1624-142933-0020 OVER EACH EYE WAS A WHITISH LINE ALTOGETHER SHE LOOKED MORE AS IF SHE MIGHT BE A BIG MEMBER OF THE SPARROW FAMILY THAN THE WIFE OF HANDSOME ROSEBREAST
1624-142933-0021 WHILE ROSEBREAST SANG MISSUS GROSBEAK WAS VERY BUSILY PICKING BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FROM THE TREE WHAT IS SHE DOING THAT FOR INQUIRED PETER FOR THE SAME REASON THAT YOU BITE OFF SWEET CLOVER BLOSSOMS AND LEAVES
1624-142933-0022 REPLIED JENNY WREN TARTLY DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS CRIED PETER I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT YOU CAN ASK MORE SILLY QUESTIONS THAN ANYBODY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE RETORTED JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0023 OF COURSE THEY DON'T LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS IF THEY DID THEY WOULD SOON STARVE TO DEATH FOR BUDS AND BLOSSOMS DON'T LAST LONG THEY EAT A FEW JUST FOR VARIETY BUT THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON BUGS AND INSECTS
1624-142933-0024 YOU ASK FARMER BROWN'S BOY WHO HELPS HIM MOST IN HIS POTATO PATCH AND HE'LL TELL YOU IT'S THE GROSBEAKS THEY CERTAINLY DO LOVE POTATO BUGS THEY EAT SOME FRUIT BUT ON THE WHOLE THEY ARE ABOUT AS USEFUL AROUND A GARDEN AS ANY ONE I KNOW
1624-142933-0025 NOW RUN ALONG PETER RABBIT AND DON'T BOTHER ME ANY MORE SEEING FARMER BROWN'S BOY COMING THROUGH THE OLD ORCHARD PETER DECIDED THAT IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HIM TO DEPART SO HE SCAMPERED FOR THE GREEN FOREST LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP
1624-142933-0026 JUST WITHIN THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOMETHING WHICH FOR THE TIME BEING PUT ALL THOUGHT OF FARMER BROWN'S BOY OUT OF HIS HEAD FLUTTERING ON THE GROUND WAS A BIRD THAN WHOM NOT EVEN GLORY THE CARDINAL WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL
1624-142933-0027 IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF REDWING THE BLACKBIRD WINGS AND TAIL WERE PURE BLACK AND ALL THE REST WAS A BEAUTIFUL SCARLET IT WAS REDCOAT THE TANAGER AT FIRST PETER HAD EYES ONLY FOR THE WONDERFUL BEAUTY OF REDCOAT
1624-142933-0028 NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SEEN REDCOAT SO CLOSE AT HAND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER PETER THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH REDCOAT AND HE HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THE TROUBLE MIGHT BE REDCOAT HEARD THE RUSTLE OF PETER'S FEET AMONG THE DRY LEAVES
1624-142933-0029 BUT HE COULD NOT GET OFF THE GROUND WHAT IS IT REDCOAT HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU IT IS JUST PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM ME CRIED PETER THE LOOK OF TERROR WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE EYES OF REDCOAT DIED OUT
1624-142933-0030 AND HE STOPPED FLUTTERING AND SIMPLY LAY PANTING OH PETER HE GASPED YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GLAD I AM THAT IT IS ONLY YOU I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM TO DO
1624-142933-0031 I CAN'T FLY AND IF I HAVE TO STAY ON THE GROUND SOME ENEMY WILL BE SURE TO GET ME WHAT SHALL I DO PETER WHAT SHALL I DO RIGHT AWAY PETER WAS FULL OF SYMPATHY
1624-142933-0032 WHAT KIND OF AN ACCIDENT WAS IT REDCOAT AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN HE ASKED BROADWING THE HAWK TRIED TO CATCH ME
1624-142933-0033 AND DID NOT SEE JUST WHERE I WAS GOING I STRUCK A SHARP POINTED DEAD TWIG AND DROVE IT RIGHT THROUGH MY RIGHT WING REDCOAT HELD UP HIS RIGHT WING AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A LITTLE STICK PROJECTING FROM BOTH SIDES CLOSE UP TO THE SHOULDER
1624-142933-0034 THE WING WAS BLEEDING A LITTLE OH DEAR WHATEVER SHALL I DO PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0035 SOBBED REDCOAT DOES IT PAIN YOU DREADFULLY ASKED PETER REDCOAT NODDED BUT I DON'T MIND THE PAIN HE HASTENED TO SAY IT IS THE THOUGHT OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO ME
1624-142933-0036 POOR REDCOAT WITH THE OLD LOOK OF TERROR IN HIS EYES FLUTTERED ALONG TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING UNDER WHICH TO HIDE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING UNDER WHICH HE COULD CRAWL AND THERE WAS NO HIDING THAT WONDERFUL RED COAT
1624-142933-0037 PETER HEARD THE SOUND OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS AND LOOKING BACK SAW THAT FARMER BROWN'S BOY WAS COMING DON'T BE AFRAID REDCOAT HE WHISPERED IT'S FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND I'M SURE HE WON'T HURT YOU PERHAPS HE CAN HELP YOU
1624-142933-0038 THEN PETER SCAMPERED OFF FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND SAT UP TO WATCH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
1624-142933-0039 NO ONE WITH ANY EYES AT ALL COULD HAVE HELPED SEEING HIM BECAUSE OF THAT WONDERFUL SCARLET COAT HE SAW TOO BY THE WAY REDCOAT WAS ACTING THAT HE WAS IN GREAT TROUBLE AS FARMER BROWN'S BOY DREW NEAR AND REDCOAT SAW THAT HE WAS DISCOVERED
1624-142933-0040 HE TRIED HIS HARDEST TO FLUTTER AWAY FARMER BROWN'S BOY UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ONE WING AND RUNNING FORWARD HE CAUGHT REDCOAT YOU POOR LITTLE THING
1624-142933-0041 SAID FARMER BROWN'S BOY SOFTLY AS HE SAW THE CRUEL TWIG STICKING THROUGH REDCOATS SHOULDER
1624-142933-0042 CONTINUED FARMER BROWN'S BOY STROKING REDCOAT EVER SO GENTLY SOMEHOW AT THAT GENTLE TOUCH REDCOAT LOST MUCH OF HIS FEAR AND A LITTLE HOPE SPRANG IN HIS HEART
1624-142933-0043 FARMER BROWN'S BOY TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND CAREFULLY CUT OFF THE TWIG ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE WING THEN DOING HIS BEST TO BE CAREFUL AND TO HURT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE HE WORKED THE OTHER PART OF THE TWIG OUT FROM THE UNDER SIDE
1624-142933-0044 CAREFULLY HE EXAMINED THE WING TO SEE IF ANY BONES WERE BROKEN NONE WERE AND AFTER HOLDING REDCOAT A FEW MINUTES HE CAREFULLY SET HIM UP IN A TREE AND WITHDREW A SHORT DISTANCE REDCOAT HOPPED FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH
1624-142933-0045 UNTIL HE WAS HALFWAY UP THE TREE THEN HE SAT THERE FOR SOME TIME AS IF FEARFUL OF TRYING THAT INJURED WING MEANWHILE MISSUS TANAGER CAME AND FUSSED ABOUT HIM AND TALKED TO HIM AND COAXED HIM AND MADE AS MUCH OF HIM AS IF HE WERE A BABY
1624-142933-0046 FROM TREE TO TREE HE FLEW
1624-168623-0000 THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED FOR MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF THIS COUPLE AND CONSIDERING IT UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS THENARDIER HAD JUST PASSED HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY MADAME THENARDIER WAS APPROACHING HER FORTIES WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO FIFTY IN A WOMAN
1624-168623-0001 SO THAT THERE EXISTED A BALANCE OF AGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE OUR READERS HAVE POSSIBLY PRESERVED SOME RECOLLECTION OF THIS THENARDIER WOMAN EVER SINCE HER FIRST APPEARANCE TALL BLOND RED FAT ANGULAR SQUARE
1624-168623-0002 ENORMOUS AND AGILE SHE BELONGED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE RACE OF THOSE COLOSSAL WILD WOMEN WHO CONTORT THEMSELVES AT FAIRS WITH PAVING STONES HANGING FROM THEIR HAIR SHE DID EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HOUSE
1624-168623-0003 MADE THE BEDS DID THE WASHING THE COOKING AND EVERYTHING ELSE COSETTE WAS HER ONLY SERVANT A MOUSE IN THE SERVICE OF AN ELEPHANT EVERYTHING TREMBLED AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE WINDOW PANES FURNITURE AND PEOPLE
1624-168623-0004 HER BIG FACE DOTTED WITH RED BLOTCHES PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF A SKIMMER SHE HAD A BEARD SHE WAS AN IDEAL MARKET PORTER DRESSED IN WOMAN'S CLOTHES SHE SWORE SPLENDIDLY
1624-168623-0005 SHE BOASTED OF BEING ABLE TO CRACK A NUT WITH ONE BLOW OF HER FIST EXCEPT FOR THE ROMANCES WHICH SHE HAD READ AND WHICH MADE THE AFFECTED LADY PEEP THROUGH THE OGRESS AT TIMES IN A VERY QUEER WAY THE IDEA WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE TO SAY OF HER
1624-168623-0006 THAT IS A WOMAN THIS THENARDIER FEMALE WAS LIKE THE PRODUCT OF A WENCH ENGRAFTED ON A FISHWIFE WHEN ONE HEARD HER SPEAK ONE SAID THAT IS A GENDARME WHEN ONE SAW HER DRINK ONE SAID THAT IS A CARTER
1624-168623-0007 WHEN ONE SAW HER HANDLE COSETTE ONE SAID THAT IS THE HANGMAN ONE OF HER TEETH PROJECTED WHEN HER FACE WAS IN REPOSE THENARDIER WAS A SMALL THIN PALE ANGULAR BONY FEEBLE MAN
1624-168623-0008 HIS CUNNING BEGAN HERE HE SMILED HABITUALLY BY WAY OF PRECAUTION AND WAS ALMOST POLITE TO EVERYBODY EVEN TO THE BEGGAR TO WHOM HE REFUSED HALF A FARTHING HE HAD THE GLANCE OF A POLE CAT AND THE BEARING OF A MAN OF LETTERS
1624-168623-0009 HE GREATLY RESEMBLED THE PORTRAITS OF THE ABBE DELILLE HIS COQUETRY CONSISTED IN DRINKING WITH THE CARTERS NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN RENDERING HIM DRUNK HE SMOKED A BIG PIPE
1624-168623-0010 HE WORE A BLOUSE AND UNDER HIS BLOUSE AN OLD BLACK COAT HE MADE PRETENSIONS TO LITERATURE AND TO MATERIALISM THERE WERE CERTAIN NAMES WHICH HE OFTEN PRONOUNCED TO SUPPORT WHATEVER THINGS HE MIGHT BE SAYING VOLTAIRE
1624-168623-0011 HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD A SYSTEM IN ADDITION HE WAS A GREAT SWINDLER
1624-168623-0012 THE SPECIES DOES EXIST IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HE PRETENDED TO HAVE SERVED IN THE ARMY HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF RELATING WITH EXUBERANCE HOW BEING A SERGEANT IN THE SIXTH OR THE NINTH LIGHT SOMETHING OR OTHER AT WATERLOO
1624-168623-0013 HE HAD ALONE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF A SQUADRON OF DEATH DEALING HUSSARS COVERED WITH HIS BODY AND SAVED FROM DEATH IN THE MIDST OF THE GRAPE SHOT A GENERAL WHO HAD BEEN DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED
1624-168623-0014 THENCE AROSE FOR HIS WALL THE FLARING SIGN AND FOR HIS INN THE NAME WHICH IT BORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CABARET OF THE SERGEANT OF WATERLOO HE WAS A LIBERAL A CLASSIC AND A BONAPARTIST
1624-168623-0015 WE BELIEVE THAT HE HAD SIMPLY STUDIED IN HOLLAND FOR AN INN KEEPER THIS RASCAL OF COMPOSITE ORDER WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME FLEMING FROM LILLE IN FLANDERS A FRENCHMAN IN PARIS A BELGIAN AT BRUSSELS
1624-168623-0016 BEING COMFORTABLY ASTRIDE OF BOTH FRONTIERS AS FOR HIS PROWESS AT WATERLOO THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THAT IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT HE EXAGGERATED IT A TRIFLE EBB AND FLOW
1624-168623-0017 A TATTERED CONSCIENCE ENTAILS A FRAGMENTARY LIFE AND APPARENTLY AT THE STORMY EPOCH OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN THENARDIER BELONGED TO THAT VARIETY OF MARAUDING SUTLERS OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
1624-168623-0018 BEATING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SELLING TO SOME STEALING FROM OTHERS AND TRAVELLING LIKE A FAMILY MAN WITH WIFE AND CHILDREN IN A RICKETY CART IN THE REAR OF TROOPS ON THE MARCH WITH AN INSTINCT FOR ALWAYS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMY
1624-168623-0019 THIS CAMPAIGN ENDED AND HAVING AS HE SAID
1624-168623-0020 OF GOLD RINGS AND SILVER CROSSES GATHERED IN HARVEST TIME IN FURROWS SOWN WITH CORPSES DID NOT AMOUNT TO A LARGE TOTAL AND DID NOT CARRY THIS SUTLER TURNED EATING HOUSE KEEPER VERY FAR
1624-168623-0021 ACCOMPANIED BY AN OATH RECALLS THE BARRACKS AND BY A SIGN OF THE CROSS THE SEMINARY HE WAS A FINE TALKER HE ALLOWED IT TO BE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS AN EDUCATED MAN
1624-168623-0022 BUT PRACTISED EYES SOMETIMES SPIED OUT ORTHOGRAPHICAL ERRORS IN IT THENARDIER WAS CUNNING GREEDY SLOTHFUL AND CLEVER HE DID NOT DISDAIN HIS SERVANTS WHICH CAUSED HIS WIFE TO DISPENSE WITH THEM
1624-168623-0023 THIS GIANTESS WAS JEALOUS IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THAT THIN AND YELLOW LITTLE MAN MUST BE AN OBJECT COVETED BY ALL THENARDIER WHO WAS ABOVE ALL AN ASTUTE AND WELL BALANCED MAN WAS A SCAMP OF A TEMPERATE SORT
1624-168623-0024 THIS IS THE WORST SPECIES HYPOCRISY ENTERS INTO IT IT IS NOT THAT THENARDIER WAS NOT ON OCCASION CAPABLE OF WRATH TO QUITE THE SAME DEGREE AS HIS WIFE BUT THIS WAS VERY RARE
1624-168623-0025 AND AT SUCH TIMES SINCE HE WAS ENRAGED WITH THE HUMAN RACE IN GENERAL AS HE BORE WITHIN HIM A DEEP FURNACE OF HATRED AND SINCE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUALLY AVENGING THEIR WRONGS
1624-168623-0026 WHO ACCUSE EVERYTHING THAT PASSES BEFORE THEM OF EVERYTHING WHICH HAS BEFALLEN THEM AND WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO CAST UPON THE FIRST PERSON WHO COMES TO HAND AS A LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCE THE SUM TOTAL OF THE DECEPTIONS THE BANKRUPTCIES AND THE CALAMITIES OF THEIR LIVES
1624-168623-0027 WHEN ALL THIS LEAVEN WAS STIRRED UP IN HIM AND BOILED FORTH FROM HIS MOUTH AND EYES HE WAS TERRIBLE WOE TO THE PERSON WHO CAME UNDER HIS WRATH AT SUCH A TIME IN ADDITION TO HIS OTHER QUALITIES THENARDIER WAS ATTENTIVE AND PENETRATING
1624-168623-0028 SILENT OR TALKATIVE ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALWAYS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE LOOK OF SAILORS WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SCREW UP THEIR EYES TO GAZE THROUGH MARINE GLASSES THENARDIER WAS A STATESMAN
1624-168623-0029 EVERY NEW COMER WHO ENTERED THE TAVERN SAID ON CATCHING SIGHT OF MADAME THENARDIER THERE IS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE A MISTAKE SHE WAS NOT EVEN THE MISTRESS THE HUSBAND WAS BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS
1624-168623-0030 SHE WORKED HE CREATED HE DIRECTED EVERYTHING BY A SORT OF INVISIBLE AND CONSTANT MAGNETIC ACTION A WORD WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM SOMETIMES A SIGN THE MASTODON OBEYED
1624-168623-0031 THOUGH SHE DID NOT THOROUGHLY REALIZE IT SHE WAS POSSESSED OF VIRTUES AFTER HER OWN KIND IF SHE HAD EVER HAD A DISAGREEMENT AS TO ANY DETAIL WITH
1624-168623-0032 WHICH WAS AN INADMISSIBLE HYPOTHESIS BY THE WAY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BLAMED HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE COMMITTED BEFORE STRANGERS THAT
1624-168623-0033 EXPOSING THE CROWN ALTHOUGH THEIR CONCORD HAD ONLY EVIL AS ITS RESULT
1624-168623-0034 VIEWED ON ITS DWARFED AND GROTESQUE SIDE THIS WAS THAT GRAND AND UNIVERSAL THING THE ADORATION OF MIND BY MATTER FOR CERTAIN UGLY FEATURES HAVE A CAUSE IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF ETERNAL BEAUTY
1624-168623-0035 HENCE THE ABSOLUTE EMPIRE OF THE MAN OVER THAT WOMAN AT CERTAIN MOMENTS SHE BEHELD HIM LIKE A LIGHTED CANDLE AT OTHERS SHE FELT HIM LIKE A CLAW THIS WOMAN WAS A FORMIDABLE CREATURE WHO LOVED NO ONE EXCEPT HER CHILDREN
1624-168623-0036 AND WHO DID NOT FEAR ANY ONE EXCEPT HER HUSBAND SHE WAS A MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS MAMMIFEROUS BUT HER MATERNITY STOPPED SHORT WITH HER DAUGHTERS AND AS WE SHALL SEE DID NOT EXTEND TO BOYS THE MAN HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT HOW TO ENRICH HIMSELF
1624-168623-0037 A THEATRE WORTHY OF THIS GREAT TALENT WAS LACKING
1624-168623-0038 IF RUIN IS POSSIBLE TO ZERO IN SWITZERLAND OR IN THE PYRENEES THIS PENNILESS SCAMP WOULD HAVE BECOME A MILLIONAIRE BUT AN INN KEEPER MUST BROWSE WHERE FATE HAS HITCHED HIM
1624-168623-0039 IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORD INN KEEPER IS HERE EMPLOYED IN A RESTRICTED SENSE AND DOES NOT EXTEND TO AN ENTIRE CLASS IN THIS SAME YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE
1624-168623-0040 THENARDIER WAS BURDENED WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS WORTH OF PETTY DEBTS AND THIS RENDERED HIM ANXIOUS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE OBSTINATE INJUSTICE OF DESTINY IN THIS CASE THENARDIER WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO UNDERSTAND BEST
1624-168623-0041 WITH THE MOST PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES HOSPITALITY BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER
1624-168623-0042 AND QUOTED FOR HIS SKILL IN SHOOTING HE HAD A CERTAIN COLD AND TRANQUIL LAUGH WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS HIS THEORIES AS A LANDLORD SOMETIMES BURST FORTH IN LIGHTNING FLASHES
1624-168623-0043 HE HAD PROFESSIONAL APHORISMS WHICH HE INSERTED INTO HIS WIFE'S MIND THE DUTY OF THE INN KEEPER
1624-168623-0044 AND A SMILE TO STOP PASSERS BY TO EMPTY SMALL PURSES AND TO HONESTLY LIGHTEN HEAVY ONES TO SHELTER TRAVELLING FAMILIES RESPECTFULLY
1624-168623-0045 TO SHAVE THE MAN TO PLUCK THE WOMAN TO PICK THE CHILD CLEAN TO QUOTE THE WINDOW OPEN THE WINDOW SHUT THE CHIMNEY CORNER THE ARM CHAIR THE CHAIR THE OTTOMAN THE STOOL THE FEATHER BED THE MATTRESS AND THE TRUSS OF STRAW
1624-168623-0046 TO KNOW HOW MUCH THE SHADOW USES UP THE MIRROR AND TO PUT A PRICE ON IT AND BY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEVILS TO MAKE THE TRAVELLER PAY FOR EVERYTHING
1624-168623-0047 THIS MAN AND THIS WOMAN WERE RUSE AND RAGE WEDDED A HIDEOUS AND TERRIBLE TEAM WHILE THE HUSBAND PONDERED AND COMBINED MADAME THENARDIER THOUGHT NOT OF ABSENT CREDITORS
1624-168623-0048 TOOK NO HEED OF YESTERDAY NOR OF TO MORROW AND LIVED IN A FIT OF ANGER ALL IN A MINUTE SUCH WERE THESE TWO BEINGS COSETTE WAS BETWEEN THEM SUBJECTED TO THEIR DOUBLE PRESSURE
1624-168623-0049 THE MAN AND THE WOMAN EACH HAD A DIFFERENT METHOD COSETTE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH BLOWS THIS WAS THE WOMAN'S SHE WENT BAREFOOTED IN WINTER THAT WAS THE MAN'S DOING
1624-168623-0050 COSETTE RAN UP STAIRS AND DOWN WASHED SWEPT RUBBED DUSTED RAN FLUTTERED ABOUT PANTED MOVED HEAVY ARTICLES AND WEAK AS SHE WAS DID THE COARSE WORK THERE WAS NO MERCY FOR HER
1624-168623-0051 A FIERCE MISTRESS AND VENOMOUS MASTER THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB IN WHICH COSETTE HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND WHERE SHE LAY TREMBLING THE IDEAL OF OPPRESSION WAS REALIZED BY THIS SINISTER HOUSEHOLD
1624-168623-0052 IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE FLY SERVING THE SPIDERS THE POOR CHILD PASSIVELY HELD HER PEACE WHAT TAKES PLACE WITHIN THESE SOULS WHEN THEY HAVE BUT JUST QUITTED GOD FIND THEMSELVES THUS
1624-168623-0053 AT THE VERY DAWN OF LIFE VERY SMALL
1841-150351-0000 THE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE THE EXPLORERS AND EARLY SETTLERS FOUND A NATIVE RACE OCCUPYING NEARLY EVERY PORTION OF OUR CONTINENT THESE PEOPLE HAD MANY CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON AND WERE ALL CALLED INDIANS
1841-150351-0001 IN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE SURFACE IS BROKEN BY NUMEROUS BARRIERS SUCH AS MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS ALMOST EVERY VALLEY WAS FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY A DISTINCT GROUP OF INDIANS CALLED A TRIBE
1841-150351-0002 THE LANGUAGE OF EACH TRIBE DIFFERED SO MUCH FROM THE LANGUAGES OF ADJOINING TRIBES THAT THEY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER THESE TRIBES WERE ALMOST CONTINUALLY AT WAR
1841-150351-0003 THE INDIANS UPON THE PACIFIC SLOPE WERE GENERALLY FOUND TO BE INFERIOR IN MOST RESPECTS TO THOSE LIVING IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CONTINENT ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT THE TRIBES POSSESSING THE FAIR AND FERTILE VALLEYS OF CALIFORNIA
1841-150351-0004 WOULD BE THE MOST ADVANCED IN CIVILIZATION BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE MANY OF THEM WERE AMONG THE MOST DEGRADED UPON THE CONTINENT THEY SEEMED UNABLE TO ADAPT THEMSELVES TO THE WHITE MAN AND HIS WAYS
1841-150351-0005 AND IN THE OLDER SETTLED DISTRICTS THEY HAVE NOW NEARLY DISAPPEARED IN THE NEWER PORTIONS OF THE NORTHWEST AND ALONG THE COAST TOWARD ALASKA THE INDIANS HAVE NOT YET COME INTO SO DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE WHITE MEN
1841-150351-0006 THEY DID NOT CULTIVATE THE SOIL NOR DID THEY HUNT A GREAT DEAL ALTHOUGH THE COUNTRY ABOUNDED WITH GAME
1841-150351-0007 THESE INDIANS HAVE OFTEN BEEN CALLED DIGGERS BECAUSE THEY DEPENDED SO LARGELY FOR THEIR LIVING UPON THE ROOTS WHICH THEY DUG IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL THAT ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO BAY THE NATIVES SHOULD HAVE USED CANOES
1841-150351-0008 BUT ACCORDING TO EARLY TRAVELLERS THEY HAD NONE WHEN THEY WISHED TO GO OUT UPON THE WATER THEY BUILT RAFTS OF BUNDLES OF RUSHES OR TULES TIED TOGETHER AT FAVORABLE POINTS ALONG THE SHORE THE INDIANS COLLECTED FOR THEIR FEASTS
1841-150351-0009 AND THESE SPOTS ARE NOW INDICATED BY HEAPS OF SHELLS IN SOME PLACES FORMING MOUNDS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE
1841-150351-0010 IN THE MOUNTAINS THE SITES OF THE VILLAGES ARE MARKED BY CHIPS OF OBSIDIAN A VOLCANIC GLASS USED IN MAKING ARROW TIPS AND BY HOLES IN THE FLAT SURFACES OF GRANITIC ROCKS NEAR SOME SPRING OR STREAM
1841-150351-0011 THESE HOLES WERE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GRINDING ACORNS OR NUTS MANY OF THE INDIAN TRIBES DEVELOPED GREAT SKILL IN THE WEAVING OF BASKETS WHICH THEY USED FOR MANY DIFFERENT PURPOSES
1841-150351-0012 THE BASKETS ARE STILL MADE IN SOME PLACES AND ARE MUCH SOUGHT AFTER BECAUSE OF THEIR BEAUTY THE INDIANS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN BUILDING THEIR HOMES DUG ROUND SHALLOW HOLES OVER WHICH POLES WERE BENT IN THE FORM OF A HALF CIRCLE
1841-150351-0013 AND AFTER HE HAD ENTERED AND ALL OPENINGS WERE CLOSED HE POURED WATER UPON THE STONES UNTIL THE ROOM WAS FILLED WITH STEAM AFTER ENDURING THIS PROCESS AS LONG AS HE DESIRED THE INDIAN CAME OUT AND PLUNGED INTO THE COLD WATER OF A NEAR BY STREAM
1841-150351-0014 AS MAY BE IMAGINED SUCH A BATH OFTEN RESULTED DISASTROUSLY TO THE WEAK OR SICK THE FACT THAT THE CALIFORNIA INDIANS COULD SUPPORT THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY GREAT EXERTION
1841-150351-0015 AT CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHEN SALMON WERE PLENTIFUL EACH TRIBE OR GROUP OF INDIANS ESTABLISHED ITS CAMP NEAR ONE OF THE MANY RAPIDS AND WATERFALLS ALONG THE COLUMBIA RIVER LARGE NUMBERS OF THE SALMON WERE CAUGHT BY THE USE OF TRAPS
1841-150351-0016 AFTER BEING PARTLY DRIED THEY WERE PACKED IN BALES FOR WINTER USE THE FISH THUS PREPARED WERE CONSIDERED VERY VALUABLE AND FORMED AN ARTICLE OF TRADE WITH THE TRIBES LIVING FARTHER FROM THE RIVER
1841-150351-0017 BUT THIS ENTHUSIASM QUICKLY DISAPPEARS IF A HEAD WIND COMES UP AND THE PARTY GOES ASHORE TO WAIT FOR THE BREEZE TO TURN IN A MORE FAVORABLE DIRECTION THESE INDIANS AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED LIVE LARGELY UPON FISH
1841-150351-0018 BERRIES ARE ABUNDANT DURING THE SUMMER AND ARE ALSO MUCH USED FOR FOOD THE CLOTHING OF THE INDIANS WAS ORIGINALLY A SORT OF BLANKET MADE OF THE WOVEN FIBRES OF CEDAR BARK OR MORE RARELY OF THE SKINS OF ANIMALS
1841-150351-0019 AND LEAVING IT THERE WHILE THE HEAD IS GROWING
1841-150351-0020 THE BUILDINGS ARE STRUNG ALONG THE SHORE CLOSE UNDER THE EDGE OF THE THICK FOREST AND JUST ABOVE THE REACH OF THE WAVES AT HIGH TIDE THEY ARE VERY SOLIDLY CONSTRUCTED
1841-150351-0021 FOR THESE INDIANS DO NOT MOVE ABOUT AS MUCH AS THOSE FARTHER SOUTH WHERE THE FORESTS ARE LESS DENSE FIGURE SIXTY FIVE SHOWS THE FRAMEWORK OF A PARTIALLY BUILT HOUSE WHILE ANOTHER STANDS AT ONE SIDE COMPLETED
1841-150351-0022 LARGE POSTS ARE SET IN THE GROUND AT THE CORNERS AND ENDS OF THE BUILDING CROSS LOGS ARE THEN PLACED UPON THE MIDDLE POSTS
1841-150351-0023 THIS IS SOMETIMES TWO FEET IN DIAMETER AND FROM SIXTY TO EIGHTY FEET LONG IT MUST REQUIRE THE UNITED STRENGTH OF MANY MEN TO ROLL SUCH A LOG INTO POSITION UPON THE FRAMEWORK THUS CONSTRUCTED SPLIT CEDAR BOARDS ARE FASTENED
1841-150351-0024 AND THE BUILDING IS PRACTICALLY FINISHED SUCH A HOUSE IS USUALLY OCCUPIED BY A NUMBER OF FAMILIES UPON QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS THERE IS A DWELLING OF THIS KIND LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD SEVEN HUNDRED INDIANS
1841-150351-0025 THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES ARE ORNAMENTED WITH FIGURES HEWN OUT OF WOOD THESE REPRESENT MEN BIRDS AND ANIMALS AND HAVE A RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE SOMETIMES THESE FIGURES ARE MOUNTED UPON THE TOPS OF TALL POLES
1841-150351-0026 THE TOTEM POLE IS A MOST INTERESTING AFFAIR FIGURE SIXTY SIX REPRESENTS THE POLE AT ALERT BAY EAST OF VANCOUVER ISLAND IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST UPON THE NORTH COAST
1841-150351-0027 THE FIGURES OF ANIMALS AND BIRDS CARVED UPON IT REPRESENT THE MYTHOLOGICAL ANCESTORS OF THE FAMILY OR CLAN IN FRONT OF WHOSE ABODE THE POLE STANDS THE INDIANS OFTEN HUNT SIMILAR ANIMALS TO DAY
1841-150351-0028 BUT BELIEVE THAT THEIR ANCESTORS HAD SUPERNATURAL POWER WHICH RAISED THEM ABOVE THE ORDINARY CREATURES THE CHINOOK INDIANS LIVE UPON THE LOWER COLUMBIA
1841-150351-0029 THE NAME CHINOOK HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A WARM DRY WIND WHICH BLOWS DOWN THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND OUT UPON THE GREAT PLAINS THIS WIND IS SO NAMED BECAUSE IT BLOWS FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE CHINOOK INDIANS COUNTRY
1841-150351-0030 THE CHINOOK JARGON IS A STRANGE SORT OF MIXED LANGUAGE WITH WHICH NEARLY ALL THE TRIBES OF THE NORTHWEST ARE FAMILIAR IT IS FORMED OF WORDS FROM THE CHINOOK LANGUAGE TOGETHER WITH OTHERS FROM DIFFERENT INDIAN LANGUAGES
1841-150351-0031 IT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THESE AMERICAN INDIANS ORIGINALLY CAME ACROSS THE NARROW STRIP OF WATER SEPARATING ASIA FROM AMERICA WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THE INDIANS HAVE OCCUPIED OUR COUNTRY
1841-150351-0032 BUT IT HAS PROBABLY BEEN SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS SOME OF THE MAIN GROUPS HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN HERE LONGER THAN OTHERS
1841-159771-0000 THERE'S NO SENSE IN WASTING OUR TIME HERE SAID SOLOMON OWL TO HIS SMALL COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER IT'S A FINE NIGHT THE MICE WILL ALL BE OUT SOONER OR LATER LET'S GO OVER AND SIT IN THAT OLD OAK ON THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW
1841-159771-0001 SIMON SCREECHER WAS MORE THAN WILLING AND THEY HAD NO SOONER SETTLED THEMSELVES AMONG THE BARE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHEN SIMON STARTED TO AMUSE HIMSELF BY GIVING HIS WELL KNOWN QUAVERING WHISTLE SOLOMON OWL STOPPED HIM QUICKLY
1841-159771-0002 DON'T DO THAT HE SAID SHARPLY DO YOU WANT TO SCARE THE MICE SIMON SCREECHER CUT HIS WHISTLE OFF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT I FORGOT HE MURMURED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE MY WHISTLING WOULD DO ANY HARM
1841-159771-0003 I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY MICE LEFT ON FARMER GREEN'S PLACE IT'S MY OPINION THAT THEY'VE MOVED AWAY MOST OF THEM OR MAYBE OLD ROUGH LEG THE HAWK HAS CAUGHT MORE THAN HIS SHARE
1841-159771-0004 SOLOMON OWL MADE NO REPLY HE WAS A PERSON OF FEW WORDS IF ANYBODY ASKED HIS OPINION HE WAS READY TO GIVE IT BUT HE SELDOM GAVE ANY UNSOUGHT ADVICE
1841-159771-0005 I'VE ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND SAID SIMON SCREECHER THAT I'D MOVE TO SOME OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD IF I KNEW WHERE THERE WAS GOOD MOUSING I'D MOVE TO MORROW WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING SOLOMON OWL STARTED EVER SO SLIGHTLY
1841-159771-0006 YOU MIGHT AS WELL SEND THEM A TELEGRAM SAYING THAT YOU'LL BE ON HAND TO MEET THEM AT EIGHT P M SIMON SCREECHER WAS SILENCED FOR THE TIME BEING AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE SOLOMON OWL GAVE ANOTHER START THERE'S THAT SQUEAK AGAIN HE WHISPERED
1841-159771-0007 I BELIEVE IT IS GETTING NEARER TOO NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HAD A TUNNEL THAT LED RIGHT BENEATH THE TREE WHERE THE TWO COUSINS WERE SITTING
1841-159771-0008 AND HE HAD STROLLED THAT WAY AFTER SCURRYING UNDER THE SNOW WHEN HE HEARD SOLOMON OWL LAUGHING IN THE WOODS EARLIER IN THE EVENING IT WAS HE THAT SOLOMON HEARD IT WAS HE THAT STUCK HIS HEAD OUT OF A HOLE IN THE SNOW AND PEEPED UP AT THE STAR SPRINKLED SKY
1841-159771-0009 HE MUST HAVE HURRIED OVER HERE FROM THE WOODS HE MUST BE VERY HUNGRY AS SOLOMON OWL RETURNED TO THE OLD OAK HIS COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER LAUGHED SOMEWHAT UNPLEASANTLY MISSED HIM DIDN'T YOU HE INQUIRED YES
1841-159771-0010 WHY DIDN'T YOU GRAB HIM OUT OF THE SNOW SIMON ASKED WHAT ARE YOUR CLAWS FOR WHAT'S YOUR BEAK FOR I COULDN'T DIG HIM OUT SOLOMON OWL REPLIED THE SNOW IS THREE FEET DEEP
1841-159771-0011 AND IT HAS SEVEN DIFFERENT CRUSTS ONE UNDER ANOTHER THIS IS A HARD WINTER SAID SIMON SCREECHER I WISH I'D GONE SOUTH LAST FALL I WONDER HOW THE MOUSING IS DOWN THERE
1841-159771-0012 EATING A TREE AS SIMON SCREECHER REMARKED TO HIS COUSIN SOLOMON OWL IT WAS A HARD WINTER THE SNOW WAS DEEP THE DAYS WERE COLD AND THE NIGHTS WERE COLDER AND WORST OF ALL FOOD BECAME SCARCE
1841-159771-0013 IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO EAT ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT THE FARM BUILDINGS WHICH FARMER GREEN HAD STUFFED FULL OF HAY AND GRAIN DURING THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN MANY OF THE FOREST FOLK STOLE DOWN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN AFTER NIGHTFALL
1841-159771-0014 AND VISITED THE FARMYARD IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A BITE OF SOMETHING OR OTHER EVEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BEGAN TO FIND IT HARDER AND HARDER TO GET ENOUGH SEEDS UNDER THE SNOW TO SATISFY HIS HUNGER
1841-159771-0015 HE HAD STORED AWAY A STOCK OF FOOD BUT IT HADN'T BEEN BIG ENOUGH AND THAT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE PROMISED HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT REPEAT IT ANOTHER TIME
1841-159771-0016 UNFORTUNATELY ALL THE PROMISES IN THE WORLD WOULDN'T GIVE HIM A SQUARE MEAL WHEN HE NEEDED ONE
1841-159771-0017 THIS IS MY FIRST WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE EXPLAINED I'M RUNNING SHORT OF FOOD AND I WISH YOU'D TELL ME WHAT TO DO IN SUCH A CASE THAT'S EASY HIS COUSIN ANSWERED GET MORE
1841-159771-0018 AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY FOR HE HAD IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO POOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE RAN AFTER HIM IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW HIS COUSIN THROUGH THE WINDING GALLERIES BENEATH THE SNOW
1841-159771-0019 SEVERAL TIMES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TOOK THE WRONG TURN AND HAD TO RETRACE HIS STEPS BUT AT LAST HE FOUND HIS BUSY COUSIN AGAIN YOU ADVISED ME TO GET MORE FOOD SAID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHERE TO GET IT
1841-159771-0020 IN THE ORCHARD HIS COUSIN CRIED AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY AGAIN I WISH HE'D WAIT A MINUTE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE GRUMBLED AS HE TORE AFTER HIS COUSIN ONCE MORE
1841-159771-0021 I DON'T FEEL LIKE RUNNING I HAVEN'T HAD A HEARTY MEAL FOR DAYS THE COUSIN SEEMED SURPRISED WHEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE OVERTOOK HIM WHAT THAT BUSY GENTLEMAN EXCLAIMED HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE ORCHARD AND BACK SO SOON NO
1841-159771-0022 HAVING SAID THOSE THREE WORDS HE DASHED OFF AGAIN EVEN FASTER THAN BEFORE TREES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ECHOED I CAN'T EAT TREES
1841-159771-0023 THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT MY COUSIN FORGOT TO EXPLAIN SO I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE TO RUN AFTER HIM AGAIN AND ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANT THE FOURTH TIME THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE FOUND HIS COUSIN HE TOOK NO CHANCES
1841-159771-0024 HE CAUGHT HIS COUSIN BY HIS TAIL AND HELD ON FIRMLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY FROM ME TILL I'VE FOUND OUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW HE DECLARED HOW CAN I EAT A TREE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE DEMANDED YOU CAN'T
1841-159771-0025 HIS COUSIN REPLIED STRUGGLING DESPERATELY TO FREE HIMSELF FOR HE WAS TOO BUSY TO STOP LONG THEN EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CRIED EAT THE BARK HIS COUSIN ANSWERED
1841-159771-0026 THEN AND NOT TILL THEN DID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE LET HIM GO MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CHASED HIS COUSIN NO MORE BUT HURRIED AWAY TO FARMER GREEN'S ORCHARD WHERE HE GNAWED A RING
1841-159771-0027 BUT FARMER GREEN DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM WHEN HE HAPPENED TO GO INTO THE ORCHARD ONE DAY LATER AND SAW TREE AFTER TREE RUINED HE WAS VERY VERY MUCH DISPLEASED
1841-159771-0028 I OUGHT TO HAVE PUT WIRE NETTING AROUND THOSE YOUNG TREES HE TOLD THE HIRED MAN THIS IS WHAT COMES OF A HARD WINTER
1841-159771-0029 A COLD DIP IN ONE WAY PETER MINK WAS LIKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HE ENJOYED SWIMMING AND HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF HIS TIME ALONG THE STREAMS THAT THREADED THEIR WAY THROUGH PLEASANT VALLEY SOMETIMES PETER DAWDLED ON THE BANKS OF SWIFT RIVER
1841-159771-0030 SOMETIMES HE LINGERED FOR DAYS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BLACK CREEK NOR DID HE DISDAIN SO SMALL A STREAM AS THE BROOK THAT CROSSED THE MEADOW IT WAS DEEP ENOUGH FOR A SWIM AND HE KNEW THAT MUSKRATS LIVED UNDER ITS BANKS
1841-159771-0031 WELL PETER MINK HAD SURPRISED MANY A ONE SWIMMING IN THE BROOK IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE MEADOW MICE PERHAPS HE WOULDN'T HAVE VISITED THE BROOK SO OFTEN EVEN IN WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE JUST HAD TO HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN
1841-159771-0032 JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS SKATING FOR JOHNNIE GREEN ON TOP OF THE BROOK IT MUSTN'T BE SUPPOSED THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE A SWIM WHEN HE WANTED ONE
1841-159771-0033 WHEN PETER MINK WANDERED ALONG A STREAM IN WINTER HE PREFERRED TO TRAVEL UNDER THE ICE RATHER THAN WALK UPON THE UPPER SIDE OF IT
1841-159771-0034 IT MADE LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO HIM WHETHER THERE WAS A DRY STRIP ALONG THE EDGE OF THE STREAM WHERE HE COULD STEAL SILENTLY ALONG WITHOUT WETTING HIS FEET WHEN HE FOUND NO PLACE TO WALK HE SWAM NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS TRICK OF PETER MINK'S
1841-159771-0035 THIS TRICK OF LURKING BENEATH THE ICE OF RIVER CREEK AND BROOK BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WOULD HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN DESPITE PETER MINK AND HIS PROWLING WAYS TO BE SURE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TRIED TO BE CAREFUL
1841-159771-0036 BEFORE HE CREPT FROM THE END OF HIS TUNNEL HE STUCK HIS HEAD OUT AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN AND ALL AROUND HE PEEPED UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK HE EVEN STARED INTO THE WATER AND THEN IF HE SAW NOBODY THAT WAS FIERCER THAN PADDY MUSKRAT
1841-159771-0037 ONLY THEN WOULD HE VENTURE TO SKIP TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND PLUNGE IN TO TELL THE TRUTH MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS FELT SAFER WHEN ONE OF THE MUSKRAT FAMILY HAPPENED TO BE TAKING A SWIM AT THE SAME TIME
1841-159771-0038 FOR THE MUSKRATS ALL HAD A WARNING SIGNAL THAT TOLD EVERYBODY WHEN THERE WAS DANGER WHEN ONE OF THEM CAUGHT SIGHT OF PETER MINK HE NEVER FAILED IF HE WAS IN THE WATER TO GIVE A LOUD SLAP UPON THE SURFACE WITH HIS TAIL
1841-159771-0039 MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS HAD ONE EAR THAT WAS LISTENING FOR THAT SLAP AND WHEN IT SOUNDED HE NEVER WAITED AN INSTANT BUT DARTED INTO HIS TUNNEL WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING TO SHAKE THE WATER OFF HIS COAT
1841-159771-0040 HE SAID THAT HE COULD DRY HIS COAT AFTER HE REACHED HOME WHILE IF HE STOPPED TO DRY IT AT THE EDGE OF THE BROOK PERHAPS HE'D NEVER GET HOME AT ALL YOU MIGHT THINK THAT NOW AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF
1841-159771-0041 OH I WON'T BOTHER TO LOOK FOR PETER MINK TO DAY HE MUST BE MILES AWAY I'LL STEP RIGHT OUT OF MY TUNNEL AND HAVE MY SWIM WITHOUT TAKING A LOOK SEE FIRST BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS NEVER SO LAZY AS THAT
1841-159771-0042 AND THE DAY CAME AT LAST WHEN IT WAS WELL WORTH HIS WHILE TO TAKE THE LITTLE EXTRA TROUBLE OF PEEPING OUT BEFORE HE HAD HIS SWIM FOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A SNAKELIKE HEAD THAT DARTED OUT FROM UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK AND DARTED BACK AGAIN OUT OF SIGHT
1841-179183-0000 AND HIS TONGUE GAVE MY HAND A LICK HE PRESSED CLOSE TO ME AS IF HE WERE FAIN TO CROWD HIMSELF INTO MY HAND HE LOVED IT WITH HIS TAIL WITH HIS PAW WITH HIS TONGUE IF HE COULD SPEAK I BELIEVE HE WOULD SAY WITH ME
1841-179183-0001 THAT PARADISE IS ATTAINED BY TOUCH FOR IN TOUCH IS ALL LOVE AND INTELLIGENCE THIS SMALL INCIDENT STARTED ME ON A CHAT ABOUT HANDS AND IF MY CHAT IS FORTUNATE I HAVE TO THANK MY DOG STAR
1841-179183-0002 IN ANY CASE IT IS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS MONOPOLIZED IT IS LIKE MAKING A NEW PATH IN THE TRACKLESS WOODS BLAZING THE TRAIL WHERE NO FOOT HAS PRESSED BEFORE
1841-179183-0003 I AM GLAD TO TAKE YOU BY THE HAND AND LEAD YOU ALONG AN UNTRODDEN WAY INTO A WORLD WHERE THE HAND IS SUPREME BUT AT THE VERY OUTSET WE ENCOUNTER A DIFFICULTY YOU ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO LIGHT
1841-179183-0004 I PROMISE THAT YOU SHALL NOT BE LED INTO FIRE OR WATER OR FALL INTO A DEEP PIT IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME PATIENTLY YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE'S A SOUND SO FINE NOTHING LIVES TWIXT IT AND SILENCE
1841-179183-0005 AND THAT THERE IS MORE MEANT IN THINGS THAN MEETS THE EYE MY HAND IS TO ME WHAT YOUR HEARING AND SIGHT TOGETHER ARE TO YOU IN LARGE MEASURE WE TRAVEL THE SAME HIGHWAYS READ THE SAME BOOKS SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE
1841-179183-0006 A SLIGHT FLUTTER OF THE FINGERS BEGAN THE INTELLIGENCE THE JOY THE FULLNESS OF MY LIFE LIKE JOB I FEEL AS IF A HAND HAD MADE ME FASHIONED ME TOGETHER ROUND ABOUT AND MOULDED MY VERY SOUL
1841-179183-0007 IN ALL MY EXPERIENCES AND THOUGHTS I AM CONSCIOUS OF A HAND WHATEVER MOVES ME WHATEVER THRILLS ME IS AS A HAND THAT TOUCHES ME IN THE DARK AND THAT TOUCH IS MY REALITY YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT A SIGHT WHICH MAKES YOU GLAD
1841-179183-0008 ALL THESE AND A THOUSAND RESULTANT COMBINATIONS WHICH TAKE SHAPE IN MY MIND CONSTITUTE MY WORLD IDEAS MAKE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN AND IMPRESSIONS FURNISH IDEAS MY WORLD IS BUILT OF TOUCH SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0009 BUT WITHOUT COLOUR AND SOUND IT BREATHES AND THROBS WITH LIFE
1841-179183-0010 OF BEAUTY OR OF INCONGRUITY FOR WITH MY HANDS I CAN FEEL THE COMIC AS WELL AS THE BEAUTIFUL IN THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THINGS REMEMBER THAT YOU DEPENDENT ON YOUR SIGHT DO NOT REALIZE HOW MANY THINGS ARE TANGIBLE
1841-179183-0011 ALL PALPABLE THINGS ARE MOBILE OR RIGID SOLID OR LIQUID BIG OR SMALL WARM OR COLD AND THESE QUALITIES ARE VARIOUSLY MODIFIED
1841-179183-0012 THE COOLNESS OF A WATER LILY ROUNDING INTO BLOOM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE COOLNESS OF AN EVENING WIND IN SUMMER AND DIFFERENT AGAIN FROM THE COOLNESS OF THE RAIN THAT SOAKS INTO THE HEARTS OF GROWING THINGS AND GIVES THEM LIFE AND BODY
1841-179183-0013 THE VELVET OF THE ROSE IS NOT THAT OF A RIPE PEACH OR OF A BABY'S DIMPLED CHEEK THE HARDNESS OF THE ROCK IS TO THE HARDNESS OF WOOD WHAT A MAN'S DEEP BASS IS TO A WOMAN'S VOICE WHEN IT IS LOW
1841-179183-0014 WHAT I CALL BEAUTY I FIND IN CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF ALL THESE QUALITIES AND IS LARGELY DERIVED FROM THE FLOW OF CURVED AND STRAIGHT LINES WHICH IS OVER ALL THINGS WHAT DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE MEAN TO YOU
1841-179183-0015 IT MEANS SEVERAL THINGS IT SYMBOLIZES DUTY IT SEEMS TO HAVE THE QUALITY OF INEXORABLENESS THAT DUTY HAS WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO THAT MUST NOT BE SET ASIDE I FEEL AS IF I WERE GOING FORWARD IN A STRAIGHT LINE
1841-179183-0016 OR GO ON FOREVER WITHOUT SWERVING TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO ESCAPE THIS MORALIZING YOU SHOULD ASK HOW DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE FEEL IT FEELS AS I SUPPOSE IT LOOKS STRAIGHT
1841-179183-0017 NOW BROKEN OFF OR LENGTHENED OR SWELLING THEY RISE AND SINK BENEATH MY FINGERS THEY ARE FULL OF SUDDEN STARTS AND PAUSES AND THEIR VARIETY IS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND WONDERFUL SO YOU SEE I AM NOT SHUT OUT FROM THE REGION OF THE BEAUTIFUL
1841-179183-0018 THOUGH MY HAND CANNOT PERCEIVE THE BRILLIANT COLOURS IN THE SUNSET OR ON THE MOUNTAIN OR REACH INTO THE BLUE DEPTHS OF THE SKY PHYSICS TELLS ME THAT I AM WELL OFF IN A WORLD WHICH I AM TOLD KNOWS NEITHER COLD NOR SOUND
1841-179183-0019 FOR AT LEAST EVERY OBJECT APPEARS TO MY FINGERS STANDING SOLIDLY RIGHT SIDE UP AND IS NOT AN INVERTED IMAGE ON THE RETINA WHICH I UNDERSTAND YOUR BRAIN IS AT INFINITE THOUGH UNCONSCIOUS LABOUR TO SET BACK ON ITS FEET
1841-179183-0020 A TANGIBLE OBJECT PASSES COMPLETE INTO MY BRAIN WITH THE WARMTH OF LIFE UPON IT AND OCCUPIES THE SAME PLACE THAT IT DOES IN SPACE FOR WITHOUT EGOTISM THE MIND IS AS LARGE AS THE UNIVERSE
1841-179183-0021 WHEN I THINK OF HILLS I THINK OF THE UPWARD STRENGTH I TREAD UPON WHEN WATER IS THE OBJECT OF MY THOUGHT I FEEL THE COOL SHOCK OF THE PLUNGE AND THE QUICK YIELDING OF THE WAVES THAT CRISP AND CURL AND RIPPLE ABOUT MY BODY
1841-179183-0022 THE PLEASING CHANGES OF ROUGH AND SMOOTH PLIANT AND RIGID CURVED AND STRAIGHT IN THE BARK AND BRANCHES OF A TREE GIVE THE TRUTH TO MY HAND THE IMMOVABLE ROCK WITH ITS JUTS AND WARPED SURFACE
1841-179183-0023 A BIRD IN MY HAND WAS THEN WORTH TWO IN THE BARNYARD MY FINGERS CANNOT OF COURSE GET THE IMPRESSION OF A LARGE WHOLE AT A GLANCE BUT I FEEL THE PARTS AND MY MIND PUTS THEM TOGETHER
1841-179183-0024 I MOVE AROUND MY HOUSE TOUCHING OBJECT AFTER OBJECT IN ORDER BEFORE I CAN FORM AN IDEA OF THE ENTIRE HOUSE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES I CAN TOUCH ONLY WHAT IS SHOWN TO ME THE CHIEF OBJECTS OF INTEREST
1841-179183-0025 CARVINGS ON THE WALL OR A CURIOUS ARCHITECTURAL FEATURE EXHIBITED LIKE THE FAMILY ALBUM THEREFORE A HOUSE WITH WHICH I AM NOT FAMILIAR HAS FOR ME AT FIRST NO GENERAL EFFECT OR HARMONY OF DETAIL
1841-179183-0026 IT IS NOT A COMPLETE CONCEPTION BUT A COLLECTION OF OBJECT IMPRESSIONS WHICH AS THEY COME TO ME ARE DISCONNECTED AND ISOLATED BUT MY MIND IS FULL OF ASSOCIATIONS SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0027 THEORIES AND WITH THEM IT CONSTRUCTS THE HOUSE THE PROCESS REMINDS ME OF THE BUILDING OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE
1841-179183-0028 THE SILENT WORKER IS IMAGINATION WHICH DECREES REALITY OUT OF CHAOS WITHOUT IMAGINATION WHAT A POOR THING MY WORLD WOULD BE
1841-179183-0029 MY GARDEN WOULD BE A SILENT PATCH OF EARTH STREWN WITH STICKS OF A VARIETY OF SHAPES AND SMELLS BUT WHEN THE EYE OF MY MIND IS OPENED TO ITS BEAUTY THE BARE GROUND BRIGHTENS BENEATH MY FEET AND THE HEDGE ROW BURSTS INTO LEAF
1841-179183-0030 AND THE ROSE TREE SHAKES ITS FRAGRANCE EVERYWHERE I KNOW HOW BUDDING TREES LOOK AND I ENTER INTO THE AMOROUS JOY OF THE MATING BIRDS AND THIS IS THE MIRACLE OF IMAGINATION
1841-179183-0031 WHICH HE HAS EMBODIED IN A SCULPTURED FORM ALTHOUGH COMPARED WITH THE LIFE WARM MOBILE FACE OF A FRIEND THE MARBLE IS COLD AND PULSELESS AND UNRESPONSIVE YET IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO MY HAND
1841-179183-0032 ITS FLOWING CURVES AND BENDINGS ARE A REAL PLEASURE ONLY BREATH IS WANTING BUT UNDER THE SPELL OF THE IMAGINATION THE MARBLE THRILLS AND BECOMES THE DIVINE REALITY OF THE IDEAL IMAGINATION PUTS A SENTIMENT INTO EVERY LINE AND CURVE
1841-179183-0033 AND THE STATUE IN MY TOUCH IS INDEED THE GODDESS HERSELF WHO BREATHES AND MOVES AND ENCHANTS IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT SOME SCULPTURES EVEN RECOGNIZED MASTERPIECES DO NOT PLEASE MY HAND
1841-179183-0034 WHEN I TOUCH WHAT THERE IS OF THE WINGED VICTORY IT REMINDS ME AT FIRST OF A HEADLESS LIMBLESS DREAM THAT FLIES TOWARDS ME IN AN UNRESTFUL SLEEP
1841-179183-0035 THE GARMENTS OF THE VICTORY THRUST STIFFLY OUT BEHIND AND DO NOT RESEMBLE GARMENTS THAT I HAVE FELT FLYING FLUTTERING FOLDING SPREADING IN THE WIND
1841-179183-0036 BUT IMAGINATION FULFILS THESE IMPERFECTIONS AND STRAIGHTWAY THE VICTORY BECOMES A POWERFUL AND SPIRITED FIGURE WITH THE SWEEP OF SEA WINDS IN HER ROBES AND THE SPLENDOUR OF CONQUEST IN HER WINGS
1841-179183-0037 AND I LIKE THE LUXURIANT WAVY HAIR OF BACCHUS AND APOLLO AND THE WREATH OF IVY SO SUGGESTIVE OF PAGAN HOLIDAYS SO IMAGINATION CROWNS THE EXPERIENCE OF MY HANDS
1841-179183-0038 AND THEY LEARNED THEIR CUNNING FROM THE WISE HAND OF ANOTHER WHICH ITSELF GUIDED BY IMAGINATION LED ME SAFELY IN PATHS THAT I KNEW NOT
1963-142393-0000 ADAM UNDERSTOOD DINAH'S HASTE TO GO AWAY AND DREW HOPE RATHER THAN DISCOURAGEMENT FROM IT
1963-142393-0001 I WISH I'D ASKED HER TO WRITE TO ME THOUGH HE THOUGHT AND YET
1963-142393-0002 SHE WANTS TO BE QUITE QUIET IN HER OLD WAY FOR A WHILE AND I'VE NO RIGHT TO BE IMPATIENT AND INTERRUPTING HER WITH MY WISHES SHE'S TOLD ME WHAT HER MIND IS AND SHE'S NOT A WOMAN TO SAY ONE THING AND MEAN ANOTHER
1963-142393-0003 I'LL WAIT PATIENTLY THAT WAS ADAM'S WISE RESOLUTION AND IT THROVE EXCELLENTLY FOR THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WEEKS ON THE NOURISHMENT IT GOT
1963-142393-0004 BUT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER THE RESOLUTION BEGAN TO DWINDLE PERCEPTIBLY AND SHOWED DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS OF EXHAUSTION THE WEEKS WERE UNUSUALLY LONG DINAH MUST SURELY HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE UP HER MIND
1963-142393-0005 HE IS A LITTLE TOO FLUSHED AND EXALTED WITH THAT FIRST DRAUGHT SHE OFFERS HIM TO CARE MUCH ABOUT THE TASTE OF THE SECOND HE TREADS THE EARTH WITH A VERY ELASTIC STEP AS HE WALKS AWAY FROM HER AND MAKES LIGHT OF ALL DIFFICULTIES
1963-142393-0006 BUT THAT SORT OF GLOW DIES OUT MEMORY GETS SADLY DILUTED WITH TIME AND IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REVIVE US ADAM WAS NO LONGER SO CONFIDENT AS HE HAD BEEN HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PERHAPS DINAH'S OLD LIFE
1963-142393-0007 WOULD HAVE TOO STRONG A GRASP UPON HER
1963-142393-0008 IF SHE HAD NOT FELT THIS SHE WOULD SURELY HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM TO GIVE HIM SOME COMFORT BUT IT APPEARED THAT SHE HELD IT RIGHT TO DISCOURAGE HIM AS ADAM'S CONFIDENCE WANED HIS PATIENCE WANED WITH IT
1963-142393-0009 AND HE THOUGHT HE MUST WRITE HIMSELF HE MUST ASK DINAH NOT TO LEAVE HIM IN PAINFUL DOUBT LONGER THAN WAS NEEDFUL HE SAT UP LATE ONE NIGHT TO WRITE HER A LETTER BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE BURNT IT AFRAID OF ITS EFFECT
1963-142393-0010 IT WOULD BE WORSE TO HAVE A DISCOURAGING ANSWER BY LETTER THAN FROM HER OWN LIPS FOR HER PRESENCE RECONCILED HIM TO HER WILL YOU PERCEIVE HOW IT WAS ADAM WAS HUNGERING FOR THE SIGHT OF DINAH
1963-142393-0011 AND WHEN THAT SORT OF HUNGER REACHES A CERTAIN STAGE A LOVER IS LIKELY TO STILL IT THOUGH HE MAY HAVE TO PUT HIS FUTURE IN PAWN BUT WHAT HARM COULD HE DO BY GOING TO SNOWFIELD DINAH COULD NOT BE DISPLEASED WITH HIM FOR IT
1963-142393-0012 SHE HAD NOT FORBIDDEN HIM TO GO SHE MUST SURELY EXPECT THAT HE WOULD GO BEFORE LONG BY THE SECOND SUNDAY IN OCTOBER
1963-142393-0013 THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO SNOWFIELD ON HORSEBACK THIS TIME FOR HIS HOURS WERE PRECIOUS NOW AND HE HAD BORROWED JONATHAN BURGE'S GOOD NAG FOR THE JOURNEY WHAT KEEN MEMORIES WENT ALONG THE ROAD WITH HIM
1963-142393-0014 HE HAD OFTEN BEEN TO OAKBOURNE AND BACK SINCE THAT FIRST JOURNEY TO SNOWFIELD BUT BEYOND OAKBOURNE THE GREYSTONE WALLS THE BROKEN COUNTRY THE MEAGRE TREES SEEMED TO BE TELLING HIM AFRESH
1963-142393-0015 THE STORY OF THAT PAINFUL PAST WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL BY HEART BUT NO STORY IS THE SAME TO US AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME OR RATHER WE WHO READ IT ARE NO LONGER THE SAME INTERPRETERS AND ADAM
1963-142393-0016 THIS MORNING BROUGHT WITH HIM NEW THOUGHTS THROUGH THAT GREY COUNTRY THOUGHTS WHICH GAVE AN ALTERED SIGNIFICANCE TO ITS STORY OF THE PAST THAT IS A BASE
1963-142393-0017 AND SELFISH EVEN A BLASPHEMOUS SPIRIT WHICH REJOICES AND IS THANKFUL OVER THE PAST EVIL THAT HAS BLIGHTED OR CRUSHED ANOTHER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MADE A SOURCE OF UNFORESEEN GOOD TO OURSELVES
1963-142393-0018 ADAM COULD NEVER CEASE TO MOURN OVER THAT MYSTERY OF HUMAN SORROW WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT SO CLOSE TO HIM HE COULD NEVER THANK GOD FOR ANOTHER'S MISERY AND IF I WERE CAPABLE OF THAT NARROW SIGHTED JOY IN ADAM'S BEHALF
1963-142393-0019 I SHOULD STILL KNOW HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO FEEL IT FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HIS HEAD AT SUCH A SENTIMENT AND SAID EVIL'S EVIL AND SORROW'S SORROW
1963-142393-0020 BY WRAPPING IT UP IN OTHER WORDS OTHER FOLKS WERE NOT CREATED FOR MY SAKE THAT I SHOULD THINK ALL SQUARE WHEN THINGS TURN OUT WELL FOR ME BUT IT IS NOT IGNOBLE TO FEEL THAT THE FULLER LIFE
1963-142393-0021 WHICH A SAD EXPERIENCE HAS BROUGHT US IS WORTH OUR OWN PERSONAL SHARE OF PAIN SURELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FEEL OTHERWISE ANY MORE THAN IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
1963-142393-0022 BY WHICH HIS DIM BLURRED SIGHT OF MEN AS TREES WALKING HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR CLEAR OUTLINE AND EFFULGENT DAY THE GROWTH OF HIGHER FEELING WITHIN US IS LIKE THE GROWTH OF FACULTY
1963-142393-0023 WE CAN NO MORE WISH TO RETURN TO A NARROWER SYMPATHY THAN A PAINTER OR A MUSICIAN CAN WISH TO RETURN TO HIS CRUDER MANNER OR A PHILOSOPHER TO HIS LESS COMPLETE FORMULA
1963-142393-0024 SOMETHING LIKE THIS SENSE OF ENLARGED BEING WAS IN ADAM'S MIND THIS SUNDAY MORNING AS HE RODE ALONG IN VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST
1963-142393-0025 THE HOPE OF PASSING HIS LIFE WITH HER HAD BEEN THE DISTANT UNSEEN POINT TOWARDS WHICH THAT HARD JOURNEY FROM SNOWFIELD EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN LEADING HIM TENDER AND DEEP AS HIS LOVE FOR HETTY HAD BEEN
1963-142393-0026 SO DEEP THAT THE ROOTS OF IT WOULD NEVER BE TORN AWAY HIS LOVE FOR DINAH WAS BETTER AND MORE PRECIOUS TO HIM FOR IT WAS THE OUTGROWTH OF THAT FULLER LIFE WHICH HAD COME TO HIM FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH DEEP SORROW
1963-142393-0027 IT'S LIKE AS IF IT WAS A NEW STRENGTH TO ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AND KNOW AS SHE LOVES ME
1963-142393-0028 FOR SHE'S BETTER THAN I AM
1963-142393-0029 AS IF YOU COULD WALK MORE FEARLESS WHEN YOU'VE MORE TRUST IN ANOTHER
1963-142393-0030 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THINKING I KNEW BETTER THAN THEM AS BELONGED TO ME
1963-142393-0031 WHEN YOU CAN'T LOOK TO THEM NEAREST TO YOU T HELP YOU WITH A BIT BETTER THOUGHT
1963-142393-0032 WHEN ADAM CAME IN SIGHT OF THE GREY TOWN ON THE HILL SIDE AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY TOWARDS THE GREEN VALLEY BELOW FOR THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE OLD THATCHED ROOF NEAR THE UGLY RED MILL THE SCENE LOOKED LESS HARSH IN THE SOFT
1963-142393-0033 OCTOBER SUNSHINE THAN IT HAD IN THE EAGER TIME OF EARLY SPRING AND THE ONE GRAND CHARM IT POSSESSED IN COMMON WITH ALL WIDE STRETCHING WOODLESS REGIONS
1963-142393-0034 THAT IT FILLED YOU WITH A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE OVERARCHING SKY HAD A MILDER MORE SOOTHING INFLUENCE THAN USUAL ON THIS ALMOST CLOUDLESS DAY ADAM'S DOUBTS AND FEARS MELTED UNDER THIS INFLUENCE
1963-142393-0035 AS THE DELICATE WEBLIKE CLOUDS HAD GRADUALLY MELTED AWAY INTO THE CLEAR BLUE ABOVE HIM HE SEEMED TO SEE DINAH'S GENTLE FACE ASSURING HIM WITH ITS LOOKS ALONE OF ALL HE LONGED TO KNOW
1963-142393-0036 HE DID NOT EXPECT DINAH TO BE AT HOME AT THIS HOUR BUT HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND TIED IT AT THE LITTLE GATE
1963-142393-0037 HE HAD SET HIS MIND ON FOLLOWING HER AND BRINGING HER HOME SHE WAS GONE TO SLOMAN'S END A HAMLET ABOUT THREE MILES OFF OVER THE HILL THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM
1963-142393-0038 TO PREACH IN A COTTAGE THERE AS HER HABIT WAS
1963-142393-0039 SO ADAM GOT ON HIS HORSE AGAIN AND RODE TO THE TOWN PUTTING UP AT THE OLD INN AND TAKING A HASTY DINNER THERE IN THE COMPANY OF THE TOO CHATTY LANDLORD FROM WHOSE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS AND REMINISCENCES
1963-142393-0040 HE WAS GLAD TO ESCAPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SET OUT TOWARDS SLOMAN'S END WITH ALL HIS HASTE IT WAS NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK BEFORE HE COULD SET OFF
1963-142393-0041 THE LITTLE GREY DESOLATE LOOKING HAMLET UNSCREENED BY SHELTERING TREES LAY IN SIGHT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED IT AND AS HE CAME NEAR HE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF VOICES SINGING A HYMN
1963-142393-0042 PERHAPS THAT'S THE LAST HYMN BEFORE THEY COME AWAY ADAM THOUGHT I'LL WALK BACK A BIT AND TURN AGAIN TO MEET HER FARTHER OFF THE VILLAGE HE WALKED BACK TILL HE GOT NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AGAIN
1963-142393-0043 AND SEATED HIMSELF ON A LOOSE STONE AGAINST THE LOW WALL TO WATCH TILL HE SHOULD SEE THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE LEAVING THE HAMLET AND WINDING UP THE HILL HE CHOSE THIS SPOT ALMOST AT THE TOP OF THE HILL
1963-142393-0044 BECAUSE IT WAS AWAY FROM ALL EYES NO HOUSE NO CATTLE NOT EVEN A NIBBLING SHEEP NEAR NO PRESENCE BUT THE STILL LIGHTS AND SHADOWS AND THE GREAT EMBRACING SKY
1963-142393-0045 SHE WAS MUCH LONGER COMING THAN HE EXPECTED HE WAITED AN HOUR AT LEAST WATCHING FOR HER AND THINKING OF HER WHILE THE AFTERNOON SHADOWS LENGTHENED AND THE LIGHT GREW SOFTER AT LAST HE SAW THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE
1963-142393-0046 COMING FROM BETWEEN THE GREY HOUSES AND GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE FOOT OF THE HILL SLOWLY ADAM THOUGHT BUT DINAH WAS REALLY WALKING AT HER USUAL PACE WITH A LIGHT QUIET STEP
1963-142393-0047 NOW SHE WAS BEGINNING TO WIND ALONG THE PATH UP THE HILL BUT ADAM WOULD NOT MOVE YET HE WOULD NOT MEET HER TOO SOON HE HAD SET HIS HEART ON MEETING HER IN THIS ASSURED LONELINESS AND NOW HE BEGAN TO FEAR
1963-142393-0048 LEST HE SHOULD STARTLE HER TOO MUCH YET HE THOUGHT SHE'S NOT ONE TO BE OVERSTARTLED SHE'S ALWAYS SO CALM AND QUIET AS IF SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING WHAT WAS SHE THINKING OF AS SHE WOUND UP THE HILL
1963-142393-0049 PERHAPS SHE HAD FOUND COMPLETE REPOSE WITHOUT HIM AND HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANY NEED OF HIS LOVE ON THE VERGE OF A DECISION WE ALL TREMBLE HOPE PAUSES WITH FLUTTERING WINGS BUT NOW AT LAST SHE WAS VERY NEAR
1963-142393-0050 AND ADAM ROSE FROM THE STONE WALL IT HAPPENED THAT JUST AS HE WALKED FORWARD DINAH HAD PAUSED AND TURNED ROUND TO LOOK BACK AT THE VILLAGE
1963-142393-0051 ADAM WAS GLAD FOR WITH THE FINE INSTINCT OF A LOVER HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR HER TO HEAR HIS VOICE BEFORE SHE SAW HIM HE CAME WITHIN THREE PACES OF HER AND THEN SAID DINAH
1963-142393-0052 SHE STARTED WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND AS IF SHE CONNECTED THE SOUND WITH NO PLACE DINAH ADAM SAID AGAIN
1963-142393-0053 WHAT WAS IN HER MIND SHE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THINK OF IMPRESSIONS AS PURELY SPIRITUAL MONITIONS THAT SHE LOOKED FOR NO MATERIAL VISIBLE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE VOICE BUT THIS SECOND TIME SHE LOOKED ROUND
1963-142393-0054 WHAT A LOOK OF YEARNING LOVE IT WAS THAT THE MILD GREY EYES TURNED ON THE STRONG DARK EYED MAN SHE DID NOT START AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE SAID NOTHING BUT MOVED TOWARDS HIM SO THAT HIS ARM COULD CLASP HER ROUND
1963-142393-0055 AND THEY WALKED ON SO IN SILENCE WHILE THE WARM TEARS FELL ADAM WAS CONTENT AND SAID NOTHING IT WAS DINAH WHO SPOKE FIRST ADAM SHE SAID IT IS THE DIVINE WILL
1963-142393-0056 MY SOUL IS SO KNIT TO YOURS THAT IT IS BUT A DIVIDED LIFE I LIVE WITHOUT YOU AND THIS MOMENT NOW YOU ARE WITH ME AND I FEEL THAT OUR HEARTS ARE FILLED WITH THE SAME LOVE I HAVE A FULNESS OF STRENGTH
1963-142393-0057 TO BEAR AND DO OUR HEAVENLY FATHER'S WILL THAT I HAD LOST BEFORE ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED INTO HER SINCERE EYES THEN WE'LL NEVER PART ANY MORE DINAH TILL DEATH PARTS US AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER

2007-132570-0009 AND HE MISTOOK LUDOVICO'S HALL FOR OLD CARLO'S
2007-132570-0010 SO WE WERE ALL AS STILL AS NIGHT THAT HE MIGHT SUPPOSE THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE ROOM BUT THE SIGNOR WAS AS CUNNING AS THE BEST OF US AND KEPT CALLING OUT AT THE DOOR
2007-132570-0011 COME FORTH MY VALOROUS SIGNOR STEWARD JUST THEN OLD CARLO OPENED HIS DOOR AND HE CAME WITH A FLASK IN HIS HAND FOR AS SOON AS THE SIGNOR SAW HIM
2007-132570-0012 HE WAS AS TAME AS COULD BE AND FOLLOWED HIM AWAY AS NATURALLY AS A DOG DOES A BUTCHER WITH A PIECE OF MEAT IN HIS BASKET ALL THIS I SAW THROUGH THE KEY HOLE WELL ANNETTE SAID LUDOVICO JEERINGLY SHALL I LET YOU OUT NOW
2007-132570-0013 INTERRUPTED EMILY QUITE WEARIED BY THIS STORY DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE ANY PRISONERS IN THE CASTLE AND WHETHER THEY ARE CONFINED AT THIS END OF THE EDIFICE
2007-132570-0014 BUT IT IS EXPECTED BACK TO NIGHT OR TO MORROW AND I SHALL KNOW THEN PERHAPS EMILY ENQUIRED IF SHE HAD EVER HEARD THE SERVANTS TALK OF PRISONERS AH MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE ARCHLY
2007-132570-0015 NOW I DARE SAY YOU ARE THINKING OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT AND THAT HE MAY HAVE COME AMONG THE ARMIES WHICH THEY SAY ARE COME FROM OUR COUNTRY TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS STATE AND THAT HE HAS MET WITH SOME OF OUR PEOPLE AND IS TAKEN CAPTIVE
2007-132570-0016 O LORD HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF IT WAS SO WOULD YOU INDEED BE GLAD SAID EMILY IN A TONE OF MOURNFUL REPROACH TO BE SURE I SHOULD
2007-132570-0017 MA'AM REPLIED ANNETTE AND WOULD NOT YOU BE GLAD TOO TO SEE SIGNOR VALANCOURT I DON'T KNOW ANY CHEVALIER I LIKE BETTER I HAVE A VERY GREAT REGARD FOR THE SIGNOR TRULY
2007-132570-0018 YOUR REGARD FOR HIM CANNOT BE DOUBTED SAID EMILY SINCE YOU WISH TO SEE HIM A PRISONER WHY NO MA'AMSELLE NOT A PRISONER EITHER BUT ONE MUST BE GLAD TO SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND IT WAS ONLY THE OTHER NIGHT I DREAMT
2007-132570-0019 AND THEN IT WAS GONE AND NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT THE OLD CASTLE WALLS SO THEY HELPED ONE ANOTHER UP AGAIN AS FAST AS THEY COULD YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE MA'AMSELLE THOUGH I SHEWED YOU THE VERY CANNON WHERE IT USED TO APPEAR
2007-132570-0020 AND ARE YOU INDEED SO SIMPLE ANNETTE SAID EMILY SMILING AT THIS CURIOUS EXAGGERATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE HAD WITNESSED AS TO CREDIT THESE STORIES CREDIT THEM MA'AMSELLE WHY
2007-132570-0021 ALL THE WORLD COULD NOT PERSUADE ME OUT OF THEM ROBERTO AND SEBASTIAN AND HALF A DOZEN MORE OF THEM WENT INTO FITS TO BE SURE THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THAT I SAID MYSELF THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT
2007-132570-0022 FOR SAYS I WHEN THE ENEMY COMES WHAT A PRETTY FIGURE THEY WILL CUT IF THEY ARE TO FALL DOWN IN FITS ALL OF A ROW THE ENEMY WON'T BE SO CIVIL PERHAPS AS TO WALK OFF LIKE THE GHOST AND LEAVE THEM TO HELP ONE ANOTHER UP
2007-132570-0023 BUT WILL FALL TO CUTTING AND SLASHING TILL HE MAKES THEM ALL RISE UP DEAD MEN NO NO SAYS I THERE IS REASON IN ALL THINGS
2007-132570-0024 BEING BECAUSE IT IS NO BUSINESS OF MINE TO LOOK GRUFF AND FIGHT BATTLES EMILY ENDEAVOURED TO CORRECT THE SUPERSTITIOUS WEAKNESS OF ANNETTE THOUGH SHE COULD NOT ENTIRELY SUBDUE HER OWN TO WHICH THE LATTER ONLY REPLIED
2007-132570-0025 NAY MA'AMSELLE YOU WILL BELIEVE NOTHING YOU ARE ALMOST AS BAD AS THE SIGNOR HIMSELF WHO WAS IN A GREAT PASSION WHEN THEY TOLD OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SWORE THAT THE FIRST MAN WHO REPEATED SUCH NONSENSE SHOULD BE THROWN INTO THE DUNGEON UNDER THE EAST TURRET THIS WAS A HARD
2007-132570-0026 BUT I DARE SAY HE HAD OTHER REASONS FOR CALLING IT SO THAN YOU HAVE MA'AM EMILY LOOKED DISPLEASED AND MADE NO REPLY AS SHE MUSED UPON THE RECOLLECTED APPEARANCE WHICH HAD LATELY SO MUCH ALARMED HER AND CONSIDERED THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FIGURE HAVING STATIONED ITSELF
2007-132570-0027 OPPOSITE TO HER CASEMENT SHE WAS FOR A MOMENT INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT WAS VALANCOURT WHOM SHE HAD SEEN YET IF IT WAS HE WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK TO HER WHEN HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO AND IF HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0028 AND HE COULD BE HERE IN NO OTHER CHARACTER HOW COULD HE OBTAIN THE MEANS OF WALKING ABROAD ON THE RAMPART
2007-132570-0029 WERE THE SAME OR IF THEY WERE WHETHER THIS WAS VALANCOURT SHE HOWEVER DESIRED THAT ANNETTE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO LEARN WHETHER ANY PRISONERS WERE IN THE CASTLE AND ALSO THEIR NAMES O DEAR MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I FORGET TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU BADE ME ASK ABOUT
2007-132570-0030 THE LADIES AS THEY CALL THEMSELVES WHO ARE LATELY COME TO UDOLPHO WHY THAT SIGNORA LIVONA THAT THE SIGNOR BROUGHT TO SEE MY LATE LADY AT VENICE IS HIS MISTRESS NOW AND WAS LITTLE BETTER THEN I DARE SAY AND LUDOVICO SAYS
2007-132570-0031 BUT PRAY BE SECRET MA'AM THAT HIS EXCELLENZA INTRODUCED HER ONLY TO IMPOSE UPON THE WORLD THAT HAD BEGUN TO MAKE FREE WITH HER CHARACTER SO WHEN PEOPLE SAW MY LADY NOTICE HER THEY THOUGHT WHAT THEY HAD HEARD MUST BE SCANDAL
2007-132570-0032 BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE DISMAL SOUNDS SO SOON AFTER MY POOR LADY'S DEATH TOO
2007-132570-0033 BUT SHE CANNOT HEAR THEM NOW POOR SOUL SAID I EMILY TURNED AWAY TO CONCEAL HER EMOTION AND THEN DESIRED ANNETTE TO GO AND MAKE ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE PRISONERS THAT MIGHT BE IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0034 BUT CONJURED HER TO DO IT WITH CAUTION AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO MENTION HER NAME OR THAT OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT NOW I THINK OF IT MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE PRISONERS FOR I OVERHEARD ONE OF THE SIGNOR'S MEN YESTERDAY
2007-132570-0035 AND SAYING WHAT A FINE THING IT WAS FOR HIS EXCELLENZA TO CATCH UP MEN AND THEY WERE AS GOOD BOOTY AS ANY OTHER BECAUSE OF THE RANSOMS
2007-132570-0036 BECAUSE SAID HE WE DON'T GO SHARES THERE THIS INFORMATION HEIGHTENED EMILY'S IMPATIENCE TO KNOW MORE AND ANNETTE IMMEDIATELY DEPARTED ON HER ENQUIRY THE LATE RESOLUTION OF EMILY TO RESIGN HER ESTATES TO MONTONI NOW GAVE WAY TO NEW CONSIDERATIONS
2007-132570-0037 THE POSSIBILITY THAT VALANCOURT WAS NEAR HER REVIVED HER FORTITUDE AND SHE DETERMINED TO BRAVE THE THREATENED VENGEANCE AT LEAST TILL SHE COULD BE ASSURED WHETHER HE WAS REALLY IN THE CASTLE SHE WAS IN THIS TEMPER OF MIND WHEN SHE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM MONTONI REQUIRING HER ATTENDANCE IN THE CEDAR PARLOUR
2007-132570-0038 WHICH SHE OBEYED WITH TREMBLING AND ON HER WAY THITHER ENDEAVOURED TO ANIMATE HER FORTITUDE WITH THE IDEA OF VALANCOURT MONTONI WAS ALONE I SENT FOR YOU SAID HE TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF RETRACTING YOUR LATE MISTAKEN ASSERTIONS
2007-132570-0039 I WILL CONDESCEND TO ADVISE WHERE I MAY COMMAND
2007-132570-0040 IF I HAVE NO RIGHT IN THESE ESTATES SIR SAID EMILY OF WHAT SERVICE CAN IT BE TO YOU THAT I SHOULD SIGN ANY PAPERS CONCERNING THEM IF THE LANDS ARE YOURS BY LAW YOU CERTAINLY MAY POSSESS THEM WITHOUT MY INTERFERENCE OR MY CONSENT
2007-132570-0041 I WILL HAVE NO MORE ARGUMENT SAID MONTONI WITH A LOOK THAT MADE HER TREMBLE WHAT HAD I BUT TROUBLE TO EXPECT WHEN I CONDESCENDED TO REASON WITH A BABY BUT I WILL BE TRIFLED WITH NO LONGER
2007-132570-0042 LET THE RECOLLECTION OF YOUR AUNT'S SUFFERINGS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER FOLLY AND OBSTINACY TEACH YOU A LESSON SIGN THE PAPERS EMILY'S RESOLUTION WAS FOR A MOMENT AWED SHE SHRUNK AT THE RECOLLECTIONS HE REVIVED
2007-132570-0043 AND FROM THE VENGEANCE HE THREATENED BUT THEN THE IMAGE OF VALANCOURT WHO SO LONG HAD LOVED HER AND WHO WAS NOW PERHAPS SO NEAR HER CAME TO HER HEART AND TOGETHER WITH THE STRONG FEELINGS OF INDIGNATION WITH WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS
2007-132570-0044 FROM HER INFANCY REGARDED AN ACT OF INJUSTICE INSPIRED HER WITH A NOBLE THOUGH IMPRUDENT COURAGE SIGN THE PAPERS SAID MONTONI MORE IMPATIENTLY THAN BEFORE NEVER SIR
2007-132570-0045 REPLIED EMILY THAT REQUEST WOULD HAVE PROVED TO ME THE INJUSTICE OF YOUR CLAIM HAD I EVEN BEEN IGNORANT OF MY RIGHT MONTONI TURNED PALE WITH ANGER WHILE HIS QUIVERING LIP AND LURKING EYE MADE HER ALMOST REPENT THE BOLDNESS OF HER SPEECH
2007-132570-0046 THEN ALL MY VENGEANCE FALLS UPON YOU HE EXCLAIMED WITH AN HORRIBLE OATH AND THINK NOT IT SHALL BE DELAYED
2007-132570-0047 YOU HAVE DARED TO QUESTION MY RIGHT NOW DARE TO QUESTION MY POWER I HAVE A PUNISHMENT WHICH YOU THINK NOT OF IT IS TERRIBLE THIS NIGHT THIS VERY NIGHT' THIS
2007-132570-0048 NIGHT REPEATED ANOTHER VOICE MONTONI PAUSED AND TURNED HALF ROUND BUT SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF HE PROCEEDED IN A LOWER TONE YOU HAVE LATELY SEEN ONE TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF OBSTINACY AND FOLLY
2007-132570-0049 YET THIS IT APPEARS HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DETER YOU
2007-132570-0050 I COULD MAKE YOU TREMBLE AT THE BARE RECITAL HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN WHICH SEEMED TO RISE FROM UNDERNEATH THE CHAMBER THEY WERE IN AND AS HE THREW A GLANCE ROUND IT IMPATIENCE AND RAGE FLASHED FROM HIS EYES
2007-132570-0051 YET SOMETHING LIKE A SHADE OF FEAR PASSED OVER HIS COUNTENANCE EMILY SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR FOR THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS SHE HAD SUFFERED NOW ALMOST OVERCAME HER BUT MONTONI PAUSED SCARCELY AN INSTANT AND COMMANDING HIS FEATURES
2007-132570-0052 RESUMED HIS DISCOURSE IN A LOWER YET STERNER VOICE I SAY I COULD GIVE YOU OTHER INSTANCES OF MY POWER AND OF MY CHARACTER WHICH IT SEEMS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR YOU WOULD NOT DEFY ME
2007-132570-0053 I COULD TELL YOU THAT WHEN ONCE MY RESOLUTION IS TAKEN BUT I AM TALKING TO A BABY LET ME HOWEVER REPEAT THAT TERRIBLE AS ARE THE EXAMPLES I COULD RECITE THE RECITAL COULD NOT NOW BENEFIT YOU
2007-132570-0054 FOR THOUGH YOUR REPENTANCE WOULD PUT AN IMMEDIATE END TO OPPOSITION IT WOULD NOT NOW APPEASE MY INDIGNATION I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE AS WELL AS JUSTICE ANOTHER GROAN FILLED THE PAUSE WHICH MONTONI MADE
2007-132570-0055 LEAVE THE ROOM INSTANTLY SAID HE SEEMING NOT TO NOTICE THIS STRANGE OCCURRENCE WITHOUT POWER TO IMPLORE HIS PITY SHE ROSE TO GO BUT FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF AWE AND TERROR OVERCAME HER AND SHE SUNK AGAIN INTO THE CHAIR
2007-132570-0056 QUIT MY PRESENCE CRIED MONTONI THIS AFFECTATION OF FEAR ILL BECOMES THE HEROINE WHO HAS JUST DARED TO BRAVE MY INDIGNATION DID YOU HEAR NOTHING SIGNOR SAID EMILY TREMBLING AND STILL UNABLE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
2007-132570-0057 I HEARD MY OWN VOICE REJOINED MONTONI STERNLY AND NOTHING ELSE
2007-132570-0058 OBEY MY ORDER REPEATED MONTONI AND FOR THESE FOOL'S TRICKS I WILL SOON DISCOVER BY WHOM THEY ARE PRACTISED EMILY AGAIN ROSE AND EXERTED HERSELF TO THE UTMOST TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHILE MONTONI FOLLOWED HER
2007-132570-0059 BUT INSTEAD OF CALLING ALOUD TO HIS SERVANTS TO SEARCH THE CHAMBER AS HE HAD FORMERLY DONE ON A SIMILAR OCCURRENCE PASSED TO THE RAMPARTS AS IN HER WAY TO THE CORRIDOR SHE RESTED FOR A MOMENT AT AN OPEN CASEMENT EMILY SAW A PARTY OF MONTONI'S TROOPS WINDING DOWN A DISTANT MOUNTAIN
2007-132570-0060 WHOM SHE NOTICED NO FURTHER THAN AS THEY BROUGHT TO HER MIND THE WRETCHED PRISONERS THEY WERE PERHAPS BRINGING TO THE CASTLE AT LENGTH HAVING REACHED HER APARTMENT SHE THREW HERSELF UPON THE COUCH OVERCOME WITH THE NEW HORRORS OF HER SITUATION
2007-149877-0000 ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING HE DINED AT RECTOR'S A RESTAURANT OF SOME LOCAL FAME WHICH OCCUPIED A BASEMENT AT CLARK AND MONROE STREETS THEREAFTER HE VISITED THE RESORT OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S IN ADAMS STREET OPPOSITE THE IMPOSING FEDERAL BUILDING
2007-149877-0001 THERE HE LEANED OVER THE SPLENDID BAR AND SWALLOWED A GLASS OF PLAIN WHISKEY AND PURCHASED A COUPLE OF CIGARS ONE OF WHICH HE LIGHTED THIS TO HIM REPRESENTED IN PART HIGH LIFE A FAIR SAMPLE OF WHAT THE WHOLE MUST BE
2007-149877-0002 DROUET WAS NOT A DRINKER IN EXCESS HE WAS NOT A MONEYED MAN HE ONLY CRAVED THE BEST AS HIS MIND CONCEIVED IT AND SUCH DOINGS SEEMED TO HIM A PART OF THE BEST
2007-149877-0003 RECTOR'S WITH ITS POLISHED MARBLE WALLS AND FLOOR ITS PROFUSION OF LIGHTS ITS SHOW OF CHINA AND SILVERWARE AND ABOVE ALL ITS REPUTATION AS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN SEEMED TO HIM THE PROPER PLACE FOR A SUCCESSFUL MAN TO GO
2007-149877-0004 HE LOVED FINE CLOTHES GOOD EATING AND PARTICULARLY THE COMPANY AND ACQUAINTANCESHIP OF SUCCESSFUL MEN WHEN DINING IT WAS A SOURCE OF KEEN SATISFACTION TO HIM TO KNOW THAT JOSEPH JEFFERSON WAS WONT TO COME TO THIS SAME PLACE
2007-149877-0005 OR THAT HENRY E DIXIE A WELL KNOWN PERFORMER OF THE DAY WAS THEN ONLY A FEW TABLES OFF AT RECTOR'S HE COULD ALWAYS OBTAIN THIS SATISFACTION FOR THERE ONE COULD ENCOUNTER POLITICIANS BROKERS ACTORS
2007-149877-0006 SOME RICH YOUNG ROUNDERS OF THE TOWN ALL EATING AND DRINKING AMID A BUZZ OF POPULAR COMMONPLACE CONVERSATION THAT'S SO AND SO OVER THERE WAS A COMMON REMARK OF THESE GENTLEMEN AMONG THEMSELVES
2007-149877-0007 PARTICULARLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAD NOT YET REACHED BUT HOPED TO DO SO THE DAZZLING HEIGHT WHICH MONEY TO DINE HERE LAVISHLY REPRESENTED YOU DON'T SAY SO WOULD BE THE REPLY WHY
2007-149877-0008 WHY HE'S MANAGER OF THE GRAND OPERA HOUSE WHEN THESE THINGS WOULD FALL UPON DROUET'S EARS HE WOULD STRAIGHTEN HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE STIFFLY AND EAT WITH SOLID COMFORT IF HE HAD ANY VANITY THIS AUGMENTED IT
2007-149877-0009 THE FLOORS WERE OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED TILES THE WALLS A COMPOSITION OF RICH DARK POLISHED WOOD WHICH REFLECTED THE LIGHT AND COLOURED STUCCO WORK WHICH GAVE THE PLACE A VERY SUMPTUOUS APPEARANCE
2007-149877-0010 THE LONG BAR WAS A BLAZE OF LIGHTS POLISHED WOOD WORK COLOURED AND CUT GLASSWARE AND MANY FANCY BOTTLES
2007-149877-0011 WITH RICH SCREENS FANCY WINES AND A LINE OF BAR GOODS UNSURPASSED IN THE COUNTRY AT RECTOR'S DROUET HAD MET MISTER G W HURSTWOOD MANAGER OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S

2007-149877-0013 WHICH WAS COMPOSED IN PART OF HIS FINE CLOTHES HIS CLEAN LINEN HIS JEWELS AND ABOVE ALL HIS OWN SENSE OF HIS IMPORTANCE DROUET IMMEDIATELY CONCEIVED A NOTION OF HIM AS BEING SOME ONE WORTH KNOWING
2007-149877-0014 AND WAS GLAD NOT ONLY TO MEET HIM BUT TO VISIT THE ADAMS STREET BAR THEREAFTER WHENEVER HE WANTED A DRINK OR A CIGAR HURSTWOOD WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER AFTER HIS KIND HE WAS SHREWD AND CLEVER IN MANY LITTLE THINGS
2007-149877-0015 AND CAPABLE OF CREATING A GOOD IMPRESSION HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION WAS FAIRLY IMPORTANT A KIND OF STEWARDSHIP WHICH WAS IMPOSING BUT LACKED FINANCIAL CONTROL HE HAD RISEN BY PERSEVERANCE AND INDUSTRY
2007-149877-0016 THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL FUNCTIONS DEVOLVED UPON THE OWNERS
2007-149877-0017 AND UPON A CASHIER WHO LOOKED AFTER THE MONEY TAKEN IN FOR THE MOST PART HE LOUNGED ABOUT DRESSED IN EXCELLENT TAILORED SUITS OF IMPORTED GOODS A SOLITAIRE RING A FINE BLUE DIAMOND IN HIS TIE A STRIKING VEST OF SOME NEW PATTERN
2007-149877-0018 AND A WATCH CHAIN OF SOLID GOLD WHICH HELD A CHARM OF RICH DESIGN AND A WATCH OF THE LATEST MAKE AND ENGRAVING HE KNEW BY NAME AND COULD GREET PERSONALLY WITH A WELL OLD FELLOW
2007-149877-0019 HUNDREDS OF ACTORS MERCHANTS POLITICIANS AND THE GENERAL RUN OF SUCCESSFUL CHARACTERS ABOUT TOWN AND IT WAS PART OF HIS SUCCESS TO DO SO HE HAD A FINELY GRADUATED SCALE OF INFORMALITY AND FRIENDSHIP WHICH IMPROVED FROM THE HOW DO YOU DO
2007-149877-0020 WHO BY LONG FREQUENTING OF THE PLACE BECAME AWARE OF HIS POSITION TO THE WHY OLD MAN HOW ARE YOU WHICH HE ADDRESSED TO THOSE NOTED OR RICH INDIVIDUALS WHO KNEW HIM AND WERE INCLINED TO BE FRIENDLY THERE WAS A CLASS HOWEVER
2007-149877-0021 TOO RICH TOO FAMOUS OR TOO SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE COULD NOT ATTEMPT ANY FAMILIARITY OF ADDRESS AND WITH THESE HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY TACTFUL ASSUMING A GRAVE AND DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE PAYING THEM THE DEFERENCE WHICH WOULD WIN THEIR GOOD FEELING
2007-149877-0022 WITHOUT IN THE LEAST COMPROMISING HIS OWN BEARING AND OPINIONS THERE WERE IN THE LAST PLACE A FEW GOOD FOLLOWERS NEITHER RICH NOR POOR FAMOUS NOR YET REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE WAS FRIENDLY ON THE SCORE OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
2007-149877-0023 THESE WERE THE KIND OF MEN WITH WHOM HE WOULD CONVERSE LONGEST AND MOST SERIOUSLY
2007-149877-0024 TO GO TO THE RACES THE THEATRES THE SPORTING ENTERTAINMENTS AT SOME OF THE CLUBS HE KEPT A HORSE AND NEAT TRAP HAD HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE WELL ESTABLISHED IN A NEAT HOUSE ON THE NORTH SIDE NEAR LINCOLN PARK
2007-149877-0025 AND WAS ALTOGETHER A VERY ACCEPTABLE INDIVIDUAL OF OUR GREAT AMERICAN UPPER CLASS THE FIRST GRADE BELOW THE LUXURIOUSLY RICH
2007-149877-0026 THE LATTER'S GENIAL NATURE AND DRESSY APPEARANCE PLEASED HIM HE KNEW THAT DROUET WAS ONLY A TRAVELLING SALESMAN AND NOT ONE OF MANY YEARS AT THAT BUT THE FIRM OF BARTLETT CARYOE AND COMPANY
2007-149877-0027 HURSTWOOD KNEW CARYOE QUITE WELL HAVING DRUNK A GLASS NOW AND THEN WITH HIM IN COMPANY WITH SEVERAL OTHERS WHEN THE CONVERSATION WAS GENERAL
2007-149877-0028 A MODERATE SENSE OF HUMOUR AND COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WHEN THE OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD TALK RACES WITH HURSTWOOD
2007-149877-0029 AND REPORT THE STATE OF TRADE IN THE CITIES WHICH HE VISITED AND SO MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF ALMOST INVARIABLY AGREEABLE TO NIGHT HE WAS PARTICULARLY SO SINCE HIS REPORT TO THE COMPANY HAD BEEN FAVOURABLY COMMENTED UPON
2007-149877-0030 HIS NEW SAMPLES HAD BEEN SATISFACTORILY SELECTED AND HIS TRIP MARKED OUT FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS WHY HELLO CHARLIE OLD MAN
2007-149877-0031 HOW GOES IT THE ROOM WAS CROWDED DROUET SHOOK HANDS BEAMING GOOD NATURE AND THEY STROLLED TOWARDS THE BAR OH ALL RIGHT I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN SIX WEEKS WHEN DID YOU GET IN
2007-149877-0032 FRIDAY SAID DROUET HAD A FINE TRIP GLAD OF IT SAID HURSTWOOD HIS BLACK EYES LIT WITH A WARMTH WHICH HALF DISPLACED THE COLD MAKE BELIEVE THAT USUALLY DWELT IN THEM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HE ADDED AS THE BARKEEPER IN SNOWY JACKET AND TIE
2007-149877-0033 LEANED TOWARD THEM FROM BEHIND THE BAR OLD PEPPER SAID DROUET A LITTLE OF THE SAME FOR ME PUT IN HURSTWOOD HOW LONG ARE YOU IN TOWN THIS TIME INQUIRED HURSTWOOD ONLY UNTIL WEDNESDAY I'M GOING UP TO SAINT PAUL

2007-149877-0035 AS WAS CONSIDERED PROPER AND HURSTWOOD TAKING THE BAREST SUGGESTION OF WHISKEY AND MODIFYING IT WITH SELTZER WHAT'S BECOME OF CARYOE REMARKED HURSTWOOD I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AROUND HERE IN TWO WEEKS
2007-149877-0036 BARELY COMES DOWN TO THE OFFICE NOW JUST ONE BOY HASN'T HE ASKED HURSTWOOD YES AND A SWIFT PACER LAUGHED DROUET I
2007-149877-0037 NO HE CAN'T INJURE THAT ANY I GUESS HURSTWOOD WAS STANDING HIS COAT OPEN HIS THUMBS IN HIS POCKETS THE LIGHT ON HIS JEWELS AND RINGS RELIEVING THEM WITH AGREEABLE DISTINCTNESS HE WAS THE PICTURE OF FASTIDIOUS COMFORT
2007-149877-0038 TO ONE NOT INCLINED TO DRINK AND GIFTED WITH A MORE SERIOUS TURN OF MIND SUCH A BUBBLING CHATTERING GLITTERING CHAMBER MUST EVER SEEM AN ANOMALY A STRANGE COMMENTARY ON NATURE AND LIFE
2007-149877-0039 HERE COME THE MOTHS IN ENDLESS PROCESSION TO BASK IN THE LIGHT OF THE FLAME SUCH CONVERSATION AS ONE MAY HEAR WOULD NOT WARRANT A COMMENDATION OF THE SCENE UPON INTELLECTUAL GROUNDS
2007-149877-0040 IT SEEMS PLAIN THAT SCHEMERS WOULD CHOOSE MORE SEQUESTERED QUARTERS TO ARRANGE THEIR PLANS THAT POLITICIANS WOULD NOT GATHER HERE IN COMPANY TO DISCUSS ANYTHING SAVE FORMALITIES WHERE THE SHARP EARED MAY HEAR AND IT WOULD SCARCELY BE JUSTIFIED ON THE SCORE OF THIRST
2007-149877-0041 NEVERTHELESS THE FACT THAT HERE MEN GATHER HERE CHATTER HERE LOVE TO PASS AND RUB ELBOWS MUST BE EXPLAINED UPON SOME GROUNDS IT MUST BE THAT A STRANGE BUNDLE OF PASSIONS AND VAGUE DESIRES
2007-149877-0042 THE MANY FRIENDS HE MET HERE DROPPED IN BECAUSE THEY CRAVED
2007-149877-0043 THE COMPANY THE GLOW THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH THEY FOUND ONE MIGHT TAKE IT AFTER ALL AS AN AUGUR OF THE BETTER SOCIAL ORDER FOR THE THINGS WHICH THEY SATISFIED HERE THOUGH SENSORY WERE NOT EVIL
2007-149877-0044 NO EVIL COULD COME OUT OF THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN EXPENSIVELY DECORATED CHAMBER THE WORST EFFECT OF SUCH A THING WOULD BE PERHAPS TO STIR UP IN THE MATERIAL MINDED AN AMBITION TO ARRANGE THEIR LIVES UPON A SIMILARLY SPLENDID BASIS
2007-149877-0045 IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT WOULD SCARCELY BE CALLED THE FAULT OF THE DECORATIONS BUT RATHER OF THE INNATE TREND OF THE MIND THAT SUCH A SCENE MIGHT STIR THE LESS EXPENSIVELY DRESSED TO EMULATE THE MORE EXPENSIVELY DRESSED
2007-149877-0046 COULD SCARCELY BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF ANYTHING SAVE THE FALSE AMBITION OF THE MINDS OF THOSE SO AFFECTED REMOVE THE ELEMENT SO THOROUGHLY AND SOLELY COMPLAINED OF LIQUOR
2007-149877-0047 AND THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE TO GAINSAY THE QUALITIES OF BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM WHICH WOULD REMAIN THE PLEASED EYE WITH WHICH OUR MODERN RESTAURANTS OF FASHION ARE LOOKED UPON IS PROOF OF THIS ASSERTION YET HERE IS THE FACT OF THE LIGHTED CHAMBER
2007-149877-0048 THE DRESSY GREEDY COMPANY THE SMALL SELF INTERESTED PALAVER THE DISORGANIZED AIMLESS WANDERING MENTAL ACTION WHICH IT REPRESENTS THE LOVE OF LIGHT AND SHOW AND FINERY WHICH TO ONE OUTSIDE
2007-149877-0049 UNDER THE SERENE LIGHT OF THE ETERNAL STARS MUST SEEM A STRANGE AND SHINY THING UNDER THE STARS AND SWEEPING NIGHT WINDS WHAT A LAMP FLOWER IT MUST BLOOM A
2007-149877-0050 INSECT INFESTED ROSE OF PLEASURE SEE THAT FELLOW COMING IN THERE SAID HURSTWOOD GLANCING AT A GENTLEMAN JUST ENTERING ARRAYED IN A HIGH HAT AND PRINCE ALBERT COAT HIS FAT CHEEKS PUFFED AND RED AS WITH GOOD EATING

2007-149877-0053 DROUET FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES MUCH INTERESTED DOESN'T LOOK MUCH LIKE A MAN WHO SEES SPIRITS DOES HE SAID DROUET OH I
2007-149877-0054 RETURNED HURSTWOOD HE'S GOT THE MONEY ALL RIGHT AND A LITTLE TWINKLE PASSED OVER HIS EYES I DON'T GO MUCH ON THOSE THINGS DO YOU
2007-149877-0055 WELL YOU NEVER CAN TELL SAID HURSTWOOD THERE MAY BE SOMETHING TO IT I WOULDN'T BOTHER ABOUT IT MYSELF THOUGH BY THE WAY HE ADDED ARE YOU GOING ANYWHERE TO NIGHT THE HOLE IN THE GROUND
2007-149877-0056 SAID DROUET MENTIONING THE POPULAR FARCE OF THE TIME WELL YOU'D BETTER BE GOING IT'S HALF AFTER EIGHT ALREADY AND HE DREW OUT HIS WATCH THE CROWD WAS ALREADY THINNING OUT CONSIDERABLY
2007-149877-0057 SOME BOUND FOR THE THEATRES SOME TO THEIR CLUBS AND SOME TO THAT MOST FASCINATING OF ALL THE PLEASURES FOR THE TYPE OF MAN THERE REPRESENTED AT LEAST THE LADIES YES I WILL SAID DROUET
2007-149877-0058 COME AROUND AFTER THE SHOW I HAVE SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU SAID HURSTWOOD SURE SAID DROUET ELATED YOU HAVEN'T ANYTHING ON HAND FOR THE NIGHT HAVE YOU ADDED HURSTWOOD NOT A THING WELL COME ROUND THEN
2007-149877-0059 I STRUCK A LITTLE PEACH COMING IN ON THE TRAIN FRIDAY REMARKED DROUET BY WAY OF PARTING BY GEORGE THAT'S SO I MUST GO AND CALL ON HER BEFORE I GO AWAY OH NEVER MIND HER HURSTWOOD REMARKED
2007-149877-0060 SAY SHE WAS A LITTLE DANDY I TELL YOU
2007-149877-0061 TWELVE O'CLOCK SAID HURSTWOOD THAT'S RIGHT
2092-145706-0000 KLETKE THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A MAN AND WOMAN WHO HAD THREE FINE LOOKING SONS BUT THEY WERE SO POOR THAT THEY HAD HARDLY ENOUGH FOOD FOR THEMSELVES LET ALONE THEIR CHILDREN
2092-145706-0001 OF HER AND THEIR FATHER THE THREE SET FORTH ON THEIR TRAVELS THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE BROTHERS WHOSE NAME WAS FERKO WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WITH A SPLENDID FIGURE BLUE EYES FAIR HAIR
2092-145706-0002 AND A COMPLEXION LIKE MILK AND ROSES HIS TWO BROTHERS WERE AS JEALOUS OF HIM AS THEY COULD BE FOR THEY THOUGHT THAT WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS HE WOULD BE SURE TO BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN THEY WOULD EVER BE
2092-145706-0003 FOR THE SUN WAS HOT AND THEY WERE TIRED OF WALKING FERKO FELL FAST ASLEEP BUT THE OTHER TWO REMAINED AWAKE AND THE ELDEST SAID TO THE SECOND BROTHER WHAT DO YOU SAY TO DOING OUR BROTHER FERKO SOME HARM
2092-145706-0004 HE IS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT EVERYONE TAKES A FANCY TO HIM WHICH IS MORE THAN THEY DO TO US IF WE COULD ONLY GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY WE MIGHT SUCCEED BETTER I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU ANSWERED THE SECOND BROTHER
2092-145706-0005 AND MY ADVICE IS TO EAT UP HIS LOAF OF BREAD AND THEN TO REFUSE TO GIVE HIM A BIT OF OURS UNTIL HE HAS PROMISED TO LET US PUT OUT HIS EYES OR BREAK HIS LEGS HIS ELDEST BROTHER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS PROPOSAL
2092-145706-0006 AND THE TWO WICKED WRETCHES SEIZED FERKO'S LOAF AND ATE IT ALL UP WHILE THE POOR BOY WAS STILL ASLEEP WHEN HE DID AWAKE HE FELT VERY HUNGRY AND TURNED TO EAT HIS BREAD BUT HIS BROTHERS CRIED OUT
2092-145706-0007 YOU ATE YOUR LOAF IN YOUR SLEEP YOU GLUTTON AND YOU MAY STARVE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE BUT YOU WON'T GET A SCRAP OF OURS FERKO WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE EATEN IN HIS SLEEP BUT HE SAID NOTHING
2092-145706-0008 AND FASTED ALL THAT DAY AND THE NEXT NIGHT BUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE BURST INTO TEARS AND IMPLORED HIS BROTHERS TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR BREAD
2092-145706-0009 AND BREAK ONE OF YOUR LEGS THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU A BIT OF OUR BREAD AT THESE WORDS POOR FERKO WEPT MORE BITTERLY THAN BEFORE AND BORE THE TORMENTS OF HUNGER TILL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
2092-145706-0010 THEN HE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER AND HE CONSENTED TO ALLOW HIS LEFT EYE TO BE PUT OUT AND HIS LEFT LEG TO BE BROKEN WHEN THIS WAS DONE HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND EAGERLY FOR THE PIECE OF BREAD
2092-145706-0011 BUT HIS BROTHERS GAVE HIM SUCH A TINY SCRAP THAT THE STARVING YOUTH FINISHED IT IN A MOMENT AND BESOUGHT THEM FOR A SECOND BIT BUT THE MORE FERKO WEPT AND TOLD HIS BROTHERS THAT HE WAS DYING OF HUNGER
2092-145706-0012 THE MORE THEY LAUGHED AND SCOLDED HIM FOR HIS GREED SO HE ENDURED THE PANGS OF STARVATION ALL THAT DAY BUT WHEN NIGHT CAME HIS ENDURANCE GAVE WAY AND HE LET HIS RIGHT EYE BE PUT OUT
2092-145706-0013 AND HIS RIGHT LEG BROKEN FOR A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AFTER HIS BROTHERS HAD THUS SUCCESSFULLY MAIMED AND DISFIGURED HIM FOR LIFE THEY LEFT HIM GROANING ON THE GROUND AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT HIM
2092-145706-0014 POOR FERKO ATE UP THE SCRAP OF BREAD THEY HAD LEFT HIM AND WEPT BITTERLY BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM OR CAME TO HIS HELP NIGHT CAME ON AND THE POOR BLIND YOUTH HAD NO EYES TO CLOSE
2092-145706-0015 AND COULD ONLY CRAWL ALONG THE GROUND NOT KNOWING IN THE LEAST WHERE HE WAS GOING BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS ONCE MORE HIGH IN THE HEAVENS FERKO FELT THE BLAZING HEAT SCORCH HIM
2092-145706-0016 AND SOUGHT FOR SOME COOL SHADY PLACE TO REST HIS ACHING LIMBS HE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A HILL AND LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS AND AS HE THOUGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF A BIG TREE
2092-145706-0017 IS THERE ANYTHING THE LEAST WONDERFUL OR REMARKABLE ABOUT THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I SHOULD JUST THINK THERE WAS REPLIED THE OTHER MANY THINGS THAT DON'T EXIST ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
2092-145706-0018 THERE IS A LAKE DOWN THERE BELOW US AND ANYONE WHO BATHES IN IT THOUGH HE WERE AT DEATH'S DOOR BECOMES SOUND AND WELL ON THE SPOT AND THOSE WHO WASH THEIR EYES WITH THE DEW ON THIS HILL
2092-145706-0019 BECOME AS SHARP SIGHTED AS THE EAGLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN BLIND FROM THEIR YOUTH WELL ANSWERED THE FIRST RAVEN MY EYES ARE IN NO WANT OF THIS HEALING BATH FOR HEAVEN BE PRAISED
2092-145706-0020 THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THEY WERE BUT MY WING HAS BEEN VERY FEEBLE AND WEAK EVER SINCE IT WAS SHOT BY AN ARROW MANY YEARS AGO SO LET US FLY AT ONCE TO THE LAKE THAT I MAY BE RESTORED TO HEALTH AND STRENGTH AGAIN
2092-145706-0021 AND SO THEY FLEW AWAY THEIR WORDS REJOICED FERKO'S HEART AND HE WAITED IMPATIENTLY TILL EVENING SHOULD COME AND HE COULD RUB THE PRECIOUS DEW ON HIS SIGHTLESS EYES
2092-145706-0022 AT LAST IT BEGAN TO GROW DUSK AND THE SUN SANK BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS GRADUALLY IT BECAME COOLER ON THE HILL AND THE GRASS GREW WET WITH DEW THEN FERKO BURIED HIS FACE IN THE GROUND
2092-145706-0023 TILL HIS EYES WERE DAMP WITH DEWDROPS AND IN A MOMENT HE SAW CLEARER THAN HE HAD EVER DONE IN HIS LIFE BEFORE THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND LIGHTED HIM TO THE LAKE WHERE HE COULD BATHE HIS POOR BROKEN LEGS
2092-145706-0024 THEN FERKO CRAWLED TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE AND DIPPED HIS LIMBS IN THE WATER NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO
2092-145706-0025 HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE MET A WOLF WHO WAS LIMPING DISCONSOLATELY ALONG ON THREE LEGS AND WHO ON PERCEIVING FERKO BEGAN TO HOWL DISMALLY MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE YOUTH
2092-145706-0026 BE OF GOOD CHEER FOR I CAN SOON HEAL YOUR LEG AND WITH THESE WORDS HE POURED SOME OF THE PRECIOUS WATER OVER THE WOLF'S PAW AND IN A MINUTE THE ANIMAL WAS SPRINGING ABOUT SOUND AND WELL ON ALL FOURS
2092-145706-0027 THE GRATEFUL CREATURE THANKED HIS BENEFACTOR WARMLY AND PROMISED FERKO TO DO HIM A GOOD TURN IF HE SHOULD EVER NEED IT FERKO CONTINUED HIS WAY TILL HE CAME TO A PLOUGHED FIELD
2092-145706-0028 HERE HE NOTICED A LITTLE MOUSE CREEPING WEARILY ALONG ON ITS HIND PAWS FOR ITS FRONT PAWS HAD BOTH BEEN BROKEN IN A TRAP FERKO FELT SO SORRY FOR THE LITTLE BEAST
2092-145706-0029 THAT HE SPOKE TO IT IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER AND WASHED ITS SMALL PAWS WITH THE HEALING WATER IN A MOMENT THE MOUSE WAS SOUND AND WHOLE AND AFTER THANKING THE KIND PHYSICIAN IT SCAMPERED AWAY OVER THE PLOUGHED FURROWS
2092-145706-0030 FERKO AGAIN PROCEEDED ON HIS JOURNEY BUT HE HADN'T GONE FAR BEFORE A QUEEN BEE FLEW AGAINST HIM TRAILING ONE WING BEHIND HER WHICH HAD BEEN CRUELLY TORN IN TWO BY A BIG BIRD
2092-145706-0031 FERKO WAS NO LESS WILLING TO HELP HER THAN HE HAD BEEN TO HELP THE WOLF AND THE MOUSE SO HE POURED SOME HEALING DROPS OVER THE WOUNDED WING ON THE SPOT THE QUEEN BEE WAS CURED AND TURNING TO FERKO SHE SAID
2092-145706-0032 I AM MOST GRATEFUL FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND SHALL REWARD YOU SOME DAY AND WITH THESE WORDS SHE FLEW AWAY HUMMING GAILY THEN FERKO WANDERED ON FOR MANY A LONG DAY
2092-145706-0033 AND AT LENGTH REACHED A STRANGE KINGDOM HERE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF HE MIGHT AS WELL GO STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND OFFER HIS SERVICES TO THE KING OF THE COUNTRY FOR HE HAD HEARD THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER
2092-145706-0034 THEY HAD MANAGED TO OBTAIN PLACES IN THE KING'S SERVICE AND WHEN THEY RECOGNISED FERKO WITH HIS EYES AND LEGS SOUND AND WELL THEY WERE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH FOR THEY FEARED HE WOULD TELL THE KING OF THEIR CONDUCT
2092-145706-0035 FOR SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE SO HANDSOME IN HER LIFE BEFORE HIS BROTHERS NOTICED THIS AND ENVY AND JEALOUSY WERE ADDED TO THEIR FEAR SO MUCH SO THAT THEY DETERMINED ONCE MORE TO DESTROY HIM
2092-145706-0036 THEY WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THAT FERKO WAS A WICKED MAGICIAN WHO HAD COME TO THE PALACE WITH THE INTENTION OF CARRYING OFF THE PRINCESS THEN THE KING HAD FERKO BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND SAID
2092-145706-0037 YOU ARE ACCUSED OF BEING A MAGICIAN WHO WISHES TO ROB ME OF MY DAUGHTER AND I CONDEMN YOU TO DEATH BUT IF YOU CAN FULFIL THREE TASKS WHICH I SHALL SET YOU TO DO YOUR LIFE SHALL BE SPARED
2092-145706-0038 ON CONDITION YOU LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT IF YOU CANNOT PERFORM WHAT I DEMAND YOU SHALL BE HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE AND TURNING TO THE TWO WICKED BROTHERS HE SAID SUGGEST SOMETHING FOR HIM TO DO
2092-145706-0039 NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT HE MUST SUCCEED IN IT OR DIE THEY DID NOT THINK LONG BUT REPLIED LET HIM BUILD YOUR MAJESTY IN ONE DAY A MORE BEAUTIFUL PALACE THAN THIS AND IF HE FAILS IN THE ATTEMPT
2092-145706-0040 LET HIM BE HUNG THE KING WAS PLEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND COMMANDED FERKO TO SET TO WORK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE TWO BROTHERS WERE DELIGHTED FOR THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD NOW GOT RID OF FERKO FOR EVER
2092-145706-0041 AS HE WAS WANDERING DISCONSOLATELY ABOUT THE MEADOWS ROUND THE PALACE WONDERING HOW HE COULD ESCAPE BEING PUT TO DEATH A LITTLE BEE FLEW PAST AND SETTLING ON HIS SHOULDER WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
2092-145706-0042 WHAT IS TROUBLING YOU MY KIND BENEFACTOR CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU I AM THE BEE WHOSE WING YOU HEALED
2092-145706-0043 A PALACE SHALL BE BUILT UNLIKE ANY THAT KING HAS DWELT IN BEFORE JUST STAY HERE TILL I COME AGAIN AND TELL YOU THAT IT IS FINISHED HAVING SAID THIS SHE FLEW MERRILY AWAY AND FERKO
2092-145706-0044 BE OF GOOD CHEER AND LEAD THE KING TO THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS AND HUMMING GAILY SHE FLEW AWAY AGAIN FERKO WENT AT ONCE TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THE PALACE WAS FINISHED
2092-145706-0045 THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER AND THEIR ASTONISHMENT WAS GREAT AT THE SIGHT WHICH MET THEIR EYES A SPLENDID PALACE REARED ITSELF ON THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY MADE OF THE MOST EXQUISITE FLOWERS
2092-145706-0046 WITH SUNFLOWERS FOR KNOCKERS AND ALL ROUND HYACINTHS AND OTHER SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS BLOOMED IN MASSES SO THAT THE AIR WAS PERFUMED FAR AND NEAR AND ENCHANTED ALL WHO WERE PRESENT
2092-145706-0047 THIS SPLENDID PALACE HAD BEEN BUILT BY THE GRATEFUL QUEEN BEE WHO HAD SUMMONED ALL THE OTHER BEES IN THE KINGDOM TO HELP HER THE KING'S AMAZEMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND THE PRINCESS'S EYES BEAMED WITH DELIGHT
2092-145706-0048 ON THE DELIGHTED FERKO BUT THE TWO BROTHERS HAD GROWN QUITE GREEN WITH ENVY AND ONLY DECLARED THE MORE THAT FERKO WAS NOTHING BUT A WICKED MAGICIAN
2092-145706-0049 THE KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED AT THE WAY HIS COMMANDS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT WAS VERY VEXED
2092-145706-0050 AND TURNING TO THE TWO BROTHERS HE SAID HE HAS CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED THE FIRST TASK WITH THE AID NO DOUBT OF HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC BUT WHAT SHALL WE GIVE HIM TO DO NOW
2092-145706-0051 LET US MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE AND IF HE FAILS HE SHALL DIE THEN THE ELDEST BROTHER REPLIED THE CORN HAS ALL BEEN CUT BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO BARNS
2092-145706-0052 LET THE KNAVE COLLECT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM INTO ONE BIG HEAP BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS LEFT LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH
2092-145706-0053 THE PRINCESS GREW WHITE WITH TERROR WHEN SHE HEARD THESE WORDS BUT FERKO FELT MUCH MORE CHEERFUL THAN HE HAD DONE THE FIRST TIME AND WANDERED OUT INTO THE MEADOWS AGAIN
2092-145706-0054 BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY OF ESCAPE THE SUN SANK TO REST AND NIGHT CAME ON WHEN A LITTLE MOUSE STARTED OUT OF THE GRASS AT FERKO'S FEET AND SAID TO HIM I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
2092-145706-0055 MY KIND BENEFACTOR BUT WHY ARE YOU LOOKING SO SAD CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU AND THUS REPAY YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO ME THEN FERKO RECOGNISED THE MOUSE WHOSE FRONT PAWS HE HAD HEALED AND REPLIED
2092-145706-0056 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM HAS TO BE GATHERED INTO ONE BIG HEAP AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS WANTING I MUST PAY FOR IT WITH MY LIFE IS THAT ALL ANSWERED THE MOUSE
2092-145706-0057 THAT NEEDN'T DISTRESS YOU MUCH JUST TRUST IN ME AND BEFORE THE SUN SETS AGAIN YOU SHALL HEAR THAT YOUR TASK IS DONE AND WITH THESE WORDS THE LITTLE CREATURE SCAMPERED AWAY INTO THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0058 FERKO WHO NEVER DOUBTED THAT THE MOUSE WOULD BE AS GOOD AS ITS WORD LAY DOWN COMFORTED ON THE SOFT GRASS AND SLEPT SOUNDLY TILL NEXT MORNING THE DAY PASSED SLOWLY
2092-145706-0059 AND THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER
2092-145706-0060 FOR IN A HEAP HIGHER THAN THE KING'S PALACE LAY ALL THE GRAIN OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT A SINGLE STALK OF CORN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN ANY OF THE FIELDS AND HOW HAD ALL THIS BEEN DONE
2092-145706-0061 THE LITTLE MOUSE HAD SUMMONED EVERY OTHER MOUSE IN THE LAND TO ITS HELP AND TOGETHER THEY HAD COLLECTED ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM THE KING COULD NOT HIDE HIS AMAZEMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME HIS WRATH INCREASED
2092-145706-0062 AND HE WAS MORE READY THAN EVER TO BELIEVE THE TWO BROTHERS WHO KEPT ON REPEATING
2092-145706-0063 THAN A WICKED MAGICIAN ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS REJOICED OVER FERKO'S SUCCESS AND LOOKED ON HIM WITH FRIENDLY GLANCES WHICH THE YOUTH RETURNED THE MORE THE CRUEL KING GAZED ON THE WONDER BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0064 THE MORE ANGRY HE BECAME FOR HE COULD NOT IN THE FACE OF HIS PROMISE PUT THE STRANGER TO DEATH HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE TWO BROTHERS AND SAID HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC HAS HELPED HIM AGAIN
2092-145706-0065 BUT NOW WHAT THIRD TASK SHALL WE SET HIM TO DO NO MATTER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS HE MUST DO IT OR DIE THE ELDEST ANSWERED QUICKLY LET HIM DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THIS HILL
2092-145706-0066 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT IF HE DOES THIS HE MAY GO FREE IF NOT HE SHALL BE HUNG AS YOU HAVE SAID AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCESS BURST INTO TEARS
2092-145706-0067 AND WHEN THE KING SAW THIS HE ORDERED HER TO BE SHUT UP IN A HIGH TOWER AND CAREFULLY GUARDED TILL THE DANGEROUS MAGICIAN SHOULD EITHER HAVE LEFT THE KINGDOM OR BEEN HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE FERKO WANDERED OUT INTO THE FIELDS AGAIN
2092-145706-0068 AND SAT DOWN ON THE STUMP OF A TREE WONDERING WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT SUDDENLY A BIG WOLF RAN UP TO HIM AND STANDING STILL SAID I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MY KIND BENEFACTOR
2092-145706-0069 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT ALL ALONE BY YOURSELF IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANY WAY ONLY SAY THE WORD FOR I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PROOF OF MY GRATITUDE FERKO AT ONCE RECOGNISED THE WOLF
2092-145706-0070 WHOSE BROKEN LEG HE HAD HEALED AND TOLD HIM WHAT HE HAD TO DO THE FOLLOWING DAY IF HE WISHED TO ESCAPE WITH HIS LIFE BUT HOW IN THE WORLD HE ADDED AM I TO COLLECT ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THAT HILL OVER THERE
2092-145706-0071 IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT DONE ANSWERED THE WOLF YOU NEEDN'T WORRY YOURSELF I'LL UNDERTAKE THE TASK AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN BEFORE SUNSET TO MORROW
2092-145706-0072 AND WITH THESE WORDS HE TROTTED QUICKLY AWAY THEN THE YOUTH REJOICED GREATLY FOR NOW HE FELT THAT HIS LIFE WAS SAFE BUT HE GREW VERY SAD WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS
2092-145706-0073 AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN IF HE LEFT THE COUNTRY HE LAY DOWN ONCE MORE ON THE GRASS AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP ALL THE NEXT DAY HE SPENT WANDERING ABOUT THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0074 THEN RETURN AT ONCE TO ME AND GET ON MY BACK AND I WILL HELP YOU TO DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES TOGETHER THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND TOLD THE KING THAT HE WAS READY TO PERFORM THE THIRD TASK IF HE WOULD COME TO THE HILL AND SEE IT DONE
2092-145706-0075 FERKO HIMSELF RETURNED TO THE FIELDS AND MOUNTING ON THE WOLF'S BACK HE RODE TO THE WOOD CLOSE BY QUICK AS LIGHTNING THE WOLF FLEW ROUND THE WOOD AND IN A MINUTE MANY HUNDRED WOLVES ROSE UP BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0076 INCREASING IN NUMBER EVERY MOMENT TILL THEY COULD BE COUNTED BY THOUSANDS HE DROVE THEM ALL BEFORE HIM ON TO THE HILL WHERE THE KING AND HIS WHOLE COURT AND FERKO'S TWO BROTHERS WERE STANDING ONLY THE LOVELY PRINCESS WAS NOT PRESENT
2092-145706-0077 FOR SHE WAS SHUT UP IN HER TOWER WEEPING BITTERLY THE WICKED BROTHERS STAMPED AND FOAMED WITH RAGE WHEN THEY SAW THE FAILURE OF THEIR WICKED DESIGNS BUT THE KING WAS OVERCOME BY A SUDDEN TERROR
2092-145706-0078 WHEN HE SAW THE ENORMOUS PACK OF WOLVES APPROACHING NEARER AND NEARER AND CALLING OUT TO FERKO HE SAID ENOUGH ENOUGH WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BUT THE WOLF ON WHOSE BACK FERKO SAT SAID TO ITS RIDER
2092-145706-0079 GO ON GO ON AND AT THE SAME MOMENT MANY MORE WOLVES RAN UP THE HILL HOWLING HORRIBLY AND SHOWING THEIR WHITE TEETH THE KING IN HIS TERROR CALLED OUT STOP A MOMENT I WILL GIVE YOU HALF MY KINGDOM
2092-145706-0080 IF YOU WILL DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES AWAY BUT FERKO PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR AND DROVE SOME MORE THOUSANDS BEFORE HIM SO THAT EVERYONE QUAKED WITH HORROR AND FEAR THEN THE KING RAISED HIS VOICE AGAIN AND CALLED OUT
2092-145706-0081 STOP YOU SHALL HAVE MY WHOLE KINGDOM IF YOU WILL ONLY DRIVE THESE WOLVES BACK TO THE PLACES THEY CAME FROM BUT THE WOLF KEPT ON ENCOURAGING FERKO AND SAID GO ON GO ON SO HE LED THE WOLVES ON
2092-145706-0082 TILL AT LAST THEY FELL ON THE KING AND ON THE WICKED BROTHERS AND ATE THEM AND THE WHOLE COURT UP IN A MOMENT THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND SET THE PRINCESS FREE AND ON THE SAME DAY
2092-145706-0083 HE MARRIED HER AND WAS CROWNED KING OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WOLVES ALL WENT PEACEFULLY BACK TO THEIR OWN HOMES AND FERKO AND HIS BRIDE LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN PEACE AND HAPPINESS TOGETHER
2092-145709-0000 KLETKE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE PRINCESSES WHO WERE ALL THREE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL BUT THE YOUNGEST ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT FAIRER THAN THE OTHER TWO WAS THE MOST LOVEABLE OF THEM ALL
2092-145709-0001 ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE PALACE IN WHICH THEY LIVED THERE STOOD A CASTLE WHICH WAS UNINHABITED AND ALMOST A RUIN BUT THE GARDEN WHICH SURROUNDED IT WAS A MASS OF BLOOMING FLOWERS
2092-145709-0002 AND IN THIS GARDEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS USED OFTEN TO WALK ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS PACING TO AND FRO UNDER THE LIME TREES A BLACK CROW HOPPED OUT OF A ROSE BUSH IN FRONT OF HER
2092-145709-0003 THE POOR BEAST WAS ALL TORN AND BLEEDING AND THE KIND LITTLE PRINCESS WAS QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT WHEN THE CROW SAW THIS IT TURNED TO HER AND SAID I AM NOT REALLY A BLACK CROW
2092-145709-0004 BUT AN ENCHANTED PRINCE WHO HAS BEEN DOOMED TO SPEND HIS YOUTH IN MISERY IF YOU ONLY LIKED PRINCESS YOU COULD SAVE ME BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY GOOD BYE TO ALL YOUR OWN PEOPLE
2092-145709-0005 AND COME AND BE MY CONSTANT COMPANION IN THIS RUINED CASTLE THERE IS ONE HABITABLE ROOM IN IT IN WHICH THERE IS A GOLDEN BED THERE YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE ALL BY YOURSELF
2092-145709-0006 AND DON'T FORGET THAT WHATEVER YOU MAY SEE OR HEAR IN THE NIGHT YOU MUST NOT SCREAM OUT FOR IF YOU GIVE AS MUCH AS A SINGLE CRY MY SUFFERINGS WILL BE DOUBLED
2092-145709-0007 THE GOOD NATURED PRINCESS AT ONCE LEFT HER HOME AND HER FAMILY AND HURRIED TO THE RUINED CASTLE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ROOM WITH THE GOLDEN BED
2092-145709-0008 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED SHE LAY DOWN BUT THOUGH SHE SHUT HER EYES TIGHT SLEEP WOULD NOT COME AT MIDNIGHT SHE HEARD TO HER GREAT HORROR SOME ONE COMING ALONG THE PASSAGE AND IN A MINUTE
2092-145709-0009 HER DOOR WAS FLUNG WIDE OPEN AND A TROOP OF STRANGE BEINGS ENTERED THE ROOM THEY AT ONCE PROCEEDED TO LIGHT A FIRE IN THE HUGE FIREPLACE THEN THEY PLACED A GREAT CAULDRON OF BOILING WATER ON IT
2092-145709-0010 WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY APPROACHED THE BED ON WHICH THE TREMBLING GIRL LAY AND SCREAMING AND YELLING ALL THE TIME THEY DRAGGED HER TOWARDS THE CAULDRON SHE NEARLY DIED WITH FRIGHT
2092-145709-0011 BUT SHE NEVER UTTERED A SOUND THEN OF A SUDDEN THE COCK CREW AND ALL THE EVIL SPIRITS VANISHED AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CROW APPEARED AND HOPPED ALL ROUND THE ROOM WITH JOY
2092-145709-0012 IT THANKED THE PRINCESS MOST HEARTILY FOR HER GOODNESS AND SAID THAT ITS SUFFERINGS HAD ALREADY BEEN GREATLY LESSENED NOW ONE OF THE PRINCESS'S ELDER SISTERS WHO WAS VERY INQUISITIVE
2092-145709-0013 THAT AT LAST THE GOOD NATURED LITTLE PRINCESS CONSENTED BUT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN THE ODD FOLK APPEARED THE ELDER SISTER SCREAMED WITH TERROR AND FROM THIS TIME ON THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
2092-145709-0014 INSISTED ALWAYS ON KEEPING WATCH ALONE SO SHE LIVED IN SOLITUDE ALL THE DAYTIME AND AT NIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED HAD SHE NOT BEEN SO BRAVE BUT EVERY DAY
2092-145709-0015 THE CROW CAME AND THANKED HER FOR HER ENDURANCE AND ASSURED HER THAT HIS SUFFERINGS WERE FAR LESS THAN THEY HAD BEEN AND SO TWO YEARS PASSED AWAY WHEN ONE DAY THE CROW CAME TO THE PRINCESS AND SAID
2092-145709-0016 IN ANOTHER YEAR I SHALL BE FREED FROM THE SPELL I AM UNDER AT PRESENT BECAUSE THEN THE SEVEN YEARS WILL BE OVER BUT BEFORE I CAN RESUME MY NATURAL FORM
2092-145709-0017 AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE BELONGINGS OF MY FOREFATHERS YOU MUST GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TAKE SERVICE AS A MAIDSERVANT THE YOUNG PRINCESS CONSENTED AT ONCE AND FOR A WHOLE YEAR
2092-145709-0018 AND HAD WORKED HER LITTLE WHITE HANDS WEARY SHE HEARD A RUSTLING BESIDE HER AND A CRY OF JOY THEN SHE SAW A HANDSOME YOUTH STANDING BESIDE HER WHO KNELT DOWN AT HER FEET
2092-145709-0019 AND KISSED THE LITTLE WEARY WHITE HANDS I AM THE PRINCE HE SAID WHO YOU IN YOUR GOODNESS WHEN I WAS WANDERING ABOUT IN THE SHAPE OF A BLACK CROW FREED FROM THE MOST AWFUL TORMENTS
2092-145709-0020 COME NOW TO MY CASTLE WITH ME AND LET US LIVE THERE HAPPILY TOGETHER SO THEY WENT TO THE CASTLE WHERE THEY HAD BOTH ENDURED SO MUCH
2092-145709-0021 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE SAME FOR IT HAD ALL BEEN REBUILT AND DONE UP AGAIN
248-130644-0000 IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO BLAME THE RECTOR OF PENNICOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE LOOKED AT GWENDOLEN AS A GIRL LIKELY TO MAKE A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE
248-130644-0001 WHY SHOULD HE BE EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS MATTER AND WISH HIS NIECE A WORSE END OF HER CHARMING MAIDENHOOD THAN THEY WOULD APPROVE AS THE BEST POSSIBLE
248-130644-0002 IT IS RATHER TO BE SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT THAT HIS FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED AND IN CONSIDERING THE RELATION OF MEANS TO ENDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERE FOLLY TO HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE EXCEPTIONAL AND IDYLLIC
248-130644-0003 IN ORDER THAT A MARQUIS MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER OR TO HAVE INSISTED THAT SINCE A FAIR MAIDEN WAS TO BE SOUGHT SHE SHOULD KEEP HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY MISTER GASCOIGNE'S CALCULATIONS WERE OF THE KIND CALLED RATIONAL
248-130644-0004 AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
248-130644-0005 HER UNCLE'S INTENTION FELL IN PERFECTLY WITH GWENDOLEN'S OWN WISHES BUT LET NO ONE SUPPOSE THAT SHE ALSO CONTEMPLATED A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE AS THE DIRECT END OF HER WITCHING THE WORLD WITH HER GRACE ON HORSEBACK OR WITH ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT
248-130644-0006 THAT SHE WAS TO BE MARRIED SOME TIME OR OTHER SHE WOULD HAVE FELT OBLIGED TO ADMIT AND THAT HER MARRIAGE WOULD NOT BE OF A MIDDLING KIND SUCH AS MOST GIRLS WERE CONTENTED WITH SHE FELT QUIETLY UNARGUMENTATIVELY SURE
248-130644-0007 BUT HER THOUGHTS NEVER DWELT ON MARRIAGE AS THE FULFILLMENT OF HER AMBITION THE DRAMAS IN WHICH SHE IMAGINED HERSELF A HEROINE WERE NOT WROUGHT UP TO THAT CLOSE TO BE VERY MUCH SUED OR HOPELESSLY SIGHED FOR AS A BRIDE WAS INDEED
248-130644-0008 AN INDISPENSABLE AND AGREEABLE GUARANTEE OF WOMANLY POWER BUT TO BECOME A WIFE AND WEAR ALL THE DOMESTIC FETTERS OF THAT CONDITION WAS ON THE WHOLE A VEXATIOUS NECESSITY HER OBSERVATION OF MATRIMONY HAD INCLINED HER TO THINK IT RATHER A DREARY STATE
248-130644-0009 IN WHICH A WOMAN COULD NOT DO WHAT SHE LIKED HAD MORE CHILDREN THAN WERE DESIRABLE WAS CONSEQUENTLY DULL AND BECAME IRREVOCABLY IMMERSED IN HUMDRUM OF COURSE MARRIAGE WAS SOCIAL PROMOTION
248-130644-0010 SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD TO A SINGLE LIFE BUT PROMOTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES TO BE TAKEN WITH BITTER HERBS A PEERAGE WILL NOT QUITE DO INSTEAD OF LEADERSHIP TO THE MAN WHO MEANT TO LEAD AND THIS DELICATE LIMBED SYLPH OF TWENTY MEANT TO LEAD
248-130644-0011 FOR SUCH PASSIONS DWELL IN FEMININE BREASTS ALSO IN GWENDOLEN'S HOWEVER THEY DWELT AMONG STRICTLY FEMININE FURNITURE AND HAD NO DISTURBING REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING OR THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
248-130644-0012 HER KNOWLEDGE BEING SUCH AS WITH NO SORT OF STANDING ROOM OR LENGTH OF LEVER COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MOVE THE WORLD SHE MEANT TO DO WHAT WAS PLEASANT TO HERSELF IN A STRIKING MANNER
248-130644-0013 AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
248-130644-0014 BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
248-130644-0015 THE ARCHERY CLUB AND INVITATIONS TO DINE WITH THE ARROWPOINTS AS THE HIGHEST LIGHTS IN HER SCENERY WAS NOT A POSITION THAT SEEMED TO OFFER REMARKABLE CHANCES BUT GWENDOLEN'S CONFIDENCE LAY CHIEFLY IN HERSELF
248-130644-0016 SHE FELT WELL EQUIPPED FOR THE MASTERY OF LIFE WITH REGARD TO MUCH IN HER LOT HITHERTO SHE HELD HERSELF RATHER HARDLY DEALT WITH BUT AS TO HER EDUCATION SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD LEFT HER UNDER NO DISADVANTAGES
248-130644-0017 IN THE SCHOOL ROOM HER QUICK MIND HAD TAKEN READILY THAT STRONG STARCH OF UNEXPLAINED RULES AND DISCONNECTED FACTS WHICH SAVES IGNORANCE FROM ANY PAINFUL SENSE OF LIMPNESS
248-130644-0018 AND WHAT REMAINED OF ALL THINGS KNOWABLE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THROUGH NOVELS PLAYS AND POEMS ABOUT HER FRENCH AND MUSIC THE TWO JUSTIFYING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A YOUNG LADY SHE FELT NO GROUND FOR UNEASINESS
248-130644-0019 AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
248-130644-0020 WHO CAN WONDER IF GWENDOLEN FELT READY TO MANAGE HER OWN DESTINY THERE WERE MANY SUBJECTS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS THE MAJORITY IN WHICH SHE FELT NO INTEREST BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID
248-130644-0021 FOR SUBJECTS ARE APT TO APPEAR STUPID TO THE YOUNG AS LIGHT SEEMS DULL TO THE OLD BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AT ALL HELPLESS IN RELATION TO THEM IF THEY HAD TURNED UP IN CONVERSATION IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD DISPUTED HER POWER OR HER GENERAL SUPERIORITY
248-130644-0022 WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
248-130644-0023 IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
248-130644-0024 IF WHEN THEY WERE UNDER THE STRESS OF TRAVELING SHE DID NOT APPEAR AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE TILL EVERY ONE ELSE HAD FINISHED THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HOW GWENDOLEN'S COFFEE AND TOAST SHOULD STILL BE OF THE HOTTEST AND CRISPEST
248-130644-0025 IT WAS ALWAYS SHE HERSELF WHO HAD TO BE TOLERANT TO BEG THAT ALICE WHO SAT WAITING ON HER WOULD NOT STICK UP HER SHOULDERS IN THAT FRIGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT ISABEL INSTEAD OF PUSHING UP TO HER AND ASKING QUESTIONS WOULD GO AWAY TO MISS MERRY
248-130644-0026 ALWAYS SHE WAS THE PRINCESS IN EXILE WHO IN TIME OF FAMINE WAS TO HAVE HER BREAKFAST ROLL MADE OF THE FINEST BOLTED FLOUR FROM THE SEVEN THIN EARS OF WHEAT AND IN A GENERAL DECAMPMENT WAS TO HAVE HER SILVER FORK KEPT OUT OF THE BAGGAGE
248-130644-0027 HOW WAS THIS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE ANSWER MAY SEEM TO LIE QUITE ON THE SURFACE IN HER BEAUTY A CERTAIN UNUSUALNESS ABOUT HER
248-130644-0028 A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
248-130644-0029 THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUDDEN SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KEEPING UP THE FORMS OF LIFE AND EVEN THE WAITERS AT HOTELS SHOWED THE MORE ALACRITY IN DOING AWAY WITH CRUMBS AND CREASES AND DREGS WITH STRUGGLING FLIES IN THEM
248-130644-0030 THIS POTENT CHARM ADDED TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS THE ELDEST DAUGHTER TOWARD WHOM HER MAMMA HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN AN APOLOGETIC STATE OF MIND FOR THE EVILS BROUGHT ON HER BY A STEP FATHER MAY SEEM SO FULL A REASON FOR GWENDOLEN'S DOMESTIC EMPIRE
248-130644-0031 THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
248-130644-0032 WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
248-130644-0033 SOME OF THEM WERE A VERY COMMON SORT OF MEN AND THE ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE AMONG THEM ALL WAS A STRONG DETERMINATION TO HAVE WHAT WAS PLEASANT WITH A TOTAL FEARLESSNESS IN MAKING THEMSELVES DISAGREEABLE OR DANGEROUS WHEN THEY DID NOT GET IT
248-130644-0034 THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
248-130644-0035 FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
248-130644-0036 WE CANNOT KILL AND NOT KILL IN THE SAME MOMENT
248-130652-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
248-130652-0001 ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
248-130652-0002 THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
248-130652-0003 MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
248-130652-0004 GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
248-130652-0005 THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
248-130652-0006 HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
248-130652-0007 GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
248-130652-0008 WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
248-130652-0009 AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
248-130652-0010 THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
248-130652-0011 TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
248-130652-0012 SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
248-130652-0013 I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
248-130652-0014 SILENCE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GRANDCOURT SAID WHAT MEN ARE INVITED HERE WITH THEIR WIVES
248-130652-0015 THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
248-130652-0016 GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
248-130652-0017 AND ONE OF YOUR DAMNED MUSICIANS BUT NOT A COMIC FELLOW I WONDER IF KLESMER WOULD CONSENT TO COME TO US WHEN HE LEAVES QUETCHAM NOTHING BUT FIRST CLASS MUSIC WILL GO DOWN WITH MISS ARROWPOINT
248-130652-0018 LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS
248-130652-0019 WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
248-130652-0020 YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION
248-130652-0021 THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
248-130652-0022 AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
248-130652-0023 PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
248-130652-0024 AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
248-130652-0025 WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
248-130652-0026 HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
248-130652-0027 EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
248-130652-0028 HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
248-130652-0029 LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
248-130652-0030 CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
248-130652-0031 IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
248-130652-0032 WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
248-130652-0033 AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
248-130652-0034 SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
248-130652-0035 AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
248-130652-0036 BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
248-130652-0037 LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
248-130652-0038 SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
248-130652-0039 AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
248-130697-0000 ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
248-130697-0001 DEEDS ARE THE PULSE OF TIME HIS BEATING LIFE AND RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS BEING DONE MUST THROB IN AFTER THROBS TILL TIME ITSELF BE LAID IN DARKNESS
248-130697-0002 AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
248-130697-0003 AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
248-130697-0004 WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
248-130697-0005 AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
248-130697-0006 PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
248-130697-0007 BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
248-130697-0008 IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
248-130697-0009 THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
248-130697-0010 AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
248-130697-0011 SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE
248-130697-0012 THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
248-130697-0013 BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
248-130697-0014 THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF
248-130697-0015 IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
248-130697-0016 WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID
248-130697-0017 I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
248-130697-0018 AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
248-130697-0019 WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
248-130697-0020 I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
248-130697-0021 IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
248-130697-0022 AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
248-130697-0023 TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
248-130697-0024 AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
248-130697-0025 NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
248-130697-0026 GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
248-130697-0027 OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
248-130697-0028 WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
248-130697-0029 BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
248-130697-0030 SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
248-130697-0031 DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
248-130697-0032 WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
248-130697-0033 YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
248-130697-0034 IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME
248-130697-0035 HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
248-130697-0036 BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
2514-149482-0000 HE RECEIVED FROM MISSUS LOWDER ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS VISIT TO KATE THE TELEGRAPHIC EXPRESSION OF A HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE FREE TO DINE WITH THEM THAT EVENING AND HIS FREEDOM AFFECTED HIM AS FORTUNATE EVEN THOUGH IN SOME DEGREE QUALIFIED BY HER MISSIVE
2514-149482-0001 EXPECTING AMERICAN FRIENDS WHOM I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU KNOW HIS KNOWLEDGE OF AMERICAN FRIENDS WAS CLEARLY AN ACCIDENT OF WHICH HE WAS TO TASTE THE FRUIT TO THE LAST BITTERNESS THIS APPREHENSION HOWEVER WE HASTEN TO ADD
2514-149482-0002 ENJOYED FOR HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE EVENT A CERTAIN MERCIFUL SHRINKAGE THE IMMEDIATE EVENT BEING THAT AT LANCASTER GATE FIVE MINUTES AFTER HIS DUE ARRIVAL PRESCRIBED HIM FOR EIGHT THIRTY MISSUS STRINGHAM CAME IN ALONE
2514-149482-0003 THE LONG DAYLIGHT THE POSTPONED LAMPS THE HABIT OF THE HOUR MADE DINNERS LATE AND GUESTS STILL LATER SO THAT PUNCTUAL AS HE WAS HE HAD FOUND MISSUS LOWDER ALONE WITH KATE HERSELF NOT YET IN THE FIELD
2514-149482-0004 HE HAD THUS HAD WITH HER SEVERAL BEWILDERING MOMENTS BEWILDERING BY REASON FAIRLY OF THEIR TACIT INVITATION TO HIM TO BE SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLE THIS WAS EXACTLY GOODNESS KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO BE
2514-149482-0005 BUT HE HAD NEVER HAD IT SO LARGELY AND FREELY SO SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLY FOR THAT MATTER IMPUTED TO HIM AS OF EASY ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS A PARTICULAR IN WHICH AUNT MAUD APPEARED TO OFFER HERSELF AS AN EXAMPLE APPEARED TO SAY QUITE AGREEABLY
2514-149482-0006 WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
2514-149482-0007 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS WELL TO ASK HER HOW FEASIBLE SHE SUPPOSED IT FOR A POOR YOUNG MAN TO RESEMBLE HER AT ANY POINT BUT HE HAD AFTER ALL SOON ENOUGH PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AS SHE WISHED BY LETTING HIS WONDER SHOW
2514-149482-0008 JUST A LITTLE AS SILLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS MOREOVER OF A SMALL STRANGE DREAD OF THE RESULTS OF DISCUSSION WITH HER STRANGE TRULY BECAUSE IT WAS HER GOOD NATURE NOT HER ASPERITY THAT HE FEARED ASPERITY MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM ANGRY
2514-149482-0009 IN WHICH THERE WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT GOOD NATURE IN HIS CONDITIONS HAD A TENDENCY TO MAKE HIM ASHAMED WHICH AUNT MAUD INDEED WONDERFULLY LIKING HIM FOR HIMSELF QUITE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING GUESSED TO SPARE HIM THEREFORE SHE ALSO AVOIDED DISCUSSION
2514-149482-0010 SHE KEPT HIM DOWN BY REFUSING TO QUARREL WITH HIM THIS WAS WHAT SHE NOW PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENJOY AND HIS SECRET DISCOMFORT WAS HIS SENSE THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT HIM BEING KEPT DOWN WAS A BORE BUT
2514-149482-0011 HIS GREAT DREAD VERILY WAS OF BEING ASHAMED WHICH WAS A THING DISTINCT AND IT MATTERED BUT LITTLE THAT HE WAS ASHAMED OF THAT TOO IT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF HIS POSITION THAT IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS THE TABLES COULD ALWAYS BE TURNED ON HIM
2514-149482-0012 THE PLACE HOWEVER MUFFLED IN CONVENIENCE AND DECORUM CONSTANTLY HUMMED FOR HIM WITH THAT THICK IRONY
2514-149482-0013 AND HE HAD ALREADY SEEN HOW LITTLE AID CAME TO HIM FROM DENOUNCING THE BRIBES AS UGLY IN FORM THAT WAS WHAT THE PRECIOUS METALS THEY ALONE COULD AFFORD TO BE IT WAS VAIN ENOUGH FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY TO TRY TO IMPART A GLOSS TO HIS OWN COMPARATIVE BRUMMAGEM
2514-149482-0014 THE HUMILIATION OF THIS IMPOTENCE WAS PRECISELY WHAT AUNT MAUD SOUGHT TO MITIGATE FOR HIM BY KEEPING HIM DOWN AND AS HER EFFORT TO THAT END HAD DOUBTLESS NEVER YET BEEN SO VISIBLE HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER FELT SO DEFINITELY PLACED IN THE WORLD
2514-149482-0015 AS WHILE HE WAITED WITH HER FOR HER HALF DOZEN OTHER GUESTS SHE WELCOMED HIM GENIALLY BACK FROM THE STATES AS TO HIS VIEW OF WHICH HER FEW QUESTIONS THOUGH NOT COHERENT WERE COMPREHENSIVE
2514-149482-0016 AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
2514-149482-0017 THE IDEA OF A VISIT TO THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY HAD CLEARLY BUT JUST OCCURRED TO HER YET SHE WAS TALKING OF IT AT THE END OF A MINUTE AS HER FAVOURITE DREAM HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN IT BUT HE PRETENDED TO THIS HELPED HER AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE
2514-149482-0018 TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND
2514-149482-0019 FOR NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THE PERSON TO THE RELIEF OF WHOSE SHYNESS HER NIECE OSTENSIBLY CAME THE OSTENSIBLE IN KATE STRUCK HIM ALTOGETHER ON THIS OCCASION AS PRODIGIOUS
2514-149482-0020 WHILE SCARCELY LESS PRODIGIOUS FOR THAT MATTER WAS HIS OWN READING ON THE SPOT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN HIS COMPANIONS A RELATION LIGHTED FOR HIM BY THE STRAIGHT LOOK NOT EXACTLY LOVING NOR LINGERING YET SEARCHING AND SOFT
2514-149482-0021 THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY
2514-149482-0022 AND CONSUMMATELY RECKONED THAT WAS THE STORY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR HER BENEFICENT DRAGON UNDER ARMS LIVING UP EVERY HOUR BUT ESPECIALLY AT FESTAL HOURS TO THE VALUE MISSUS LOWDER HAD ATTACHED TO HER
2514-149482-0023 HIGH AND FIXED THIS ESTIMATE RULED ON EACH OCCASION AT LANCASTER GATE THE SOCIAL SCENE SO THAT HE NOW RECOGNISED IN IT SOMETHING LIKE THE ARTISTIC IDEA THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE IMPOSED BY TRADITION BY GENIUS BY CRITICISM
2514-149482-0024 IN RESPECT TO A GIVEN CHARACTER ON A DISTINGUISHED ACTRESS AS SUCH A PERSON WAS TO DRESS THE PART TO WALK TO LOOK TO SPEAK IN EVERY WAY TO EXPRESS THE PART SO ALL THIS WAS WHAT KATE WAS TO DO FOR THE CHARACTER SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN
2514-149482-0025 THINGS ALL PERFECTLY PONDERABLE TO CRITICISM AND THE WAY FOR HER TO MEET CRITICISM WAS EVIDENTLY AT THE START TO BE SURE HER MAKE UP HAD HAD THE LAST TOUCH AND THAT SHE LOOKED AT LEAST NO WORSE THAN USUAL
2514-149482-0026 AUNT MAUD'S APPRECIATION OF THAT TO NIGHT WAS INDEED MANAGERIAL AND THE PERFORMER'S OWN CONTRIBUTION FAIRLY THAT OF THE FAULTLESS SOLDIER ON PARADE DENSHER SAW HIMSELF FOR THE MOMENT AS IN HIS PURCHASED STALL AT THE PLAY
2514-149482-0027 THE WATCHFUL MANAGER WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF A BOX AND THE POOR ACTRESS IN THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT SHE PASSED THE POOR PERFORMER HE COULD SEE HOW SHE ALWAYS PASSED HER WIG HER PAINT HER JEWELS EVERY MARK OF HER EXPRESSION IMPECCABLE
2514-149482-0028 AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER
2514-149482-0029 TIME AMONG THEM FOR HIM TO FEEL ALMOST TOO SCARED TO TAKE PART IN THE OVATION HE STRUCK HIMSELF AS HAVING LOST FOR THE MINUTE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SO THAT IN ANY CASE HE ONLY STARED IN SILENCE AT THE OLDER WOMAN'S TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
2514-149482-0030 IT WAS AS IF THE DRAMA IT THUS CAME TO HIM FOR THE FACT OF A DRAMA THERE WAS NO BLINKING WAS BETWEEN THEM THEM QUITE PREPONDERANTLY WITH MERTON DENSHER RELEGATED TO MERE SPECTATORSHIP A PAYING PLACE IN FRONT AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE
2514-149482-0031 THIS WAS WHY HIS APPRECIATION HAD TURNED FOR THE INSTANT TO FEAR HAD JUST TURNED AS WE HAVE SAID TO SICKNESS
2514-149482-0032 THAT THE DISCIPLINED FACE DID OFFER HIM OVER THE FOOTLIGHTS AS HE BELIEVED THE SMALL GLEAM FINE FAINT BUT EXQUISITE OF A SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE SO MIGHT A PRACTISED PERFORMER EVEN WHEN RAKED BY DOUBLE BARRELLED GLASSES SEEM TO BE ALL IN HER PART
2514-149482-0033 AND YET CONVEY A SIGN TO THE PERSON IN THE HOUSE SHE LOVED BEST THE DRAMA AT ALL EVENTS AS DENSHER SAW IT MEANWHILE WENT ON AMPLIFIED SOON ENOUGH BY THE ADVENT OF TWO OTHER GUESTS STRAY GENTLEMEN BOTH STRAGGLERS IN THE ROUT OF THE SEASON
2514-149482-0034 WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE
2514-149482-0035 THAT EACH IN HIS WAY MADE ONE THE EXPANSIVE THE OTHER THE CONTRACTILE EFFECT OF THE PERFECT WHITE WAISTCOAT A SCRATCH COMPANY OF TWO INNOCUOUS YOUTHS AND A PACIFIED VETERAN WAS THEREFORE WHAT NOW OFFERED ITSELF TO MISSUS STRINGHAM
2514-149482-0036 HER COMPANION AT THE LAST MOMENT HAD BEEN INDISPOSED POSITIVELY NOT WELL ENOUGH AND SO HAD PACKED HER OFF INSISTENTLY WITH EXCUSES WITH WILD REGRETS
2514-149482-0037 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR CHARMING FRIEND'S ILLNESS WAS THE FIRST THING KATE TOOK UP WITH DENSHER ON THEIR BEING ABLE AFTER DINNER
2514-149482-0038 NATURALLY AS SHE CALLED IT WHICH WASN'T WHAT HE DID TOGETHER BUT IT WAS ALREADY AS IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD BY AN ODD IMPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
2514-149482-0039 MISSUS LOWDER HAD MADE DEAR MILLY THE TOPIC AND IT PROVED ON THE SPOT A TOPIC AS FAMILIAR TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNGER AS TO THE SAGACIOUS OLDER MAN ANY KNOWLEDGE THEY MIGHT LACK MISSUS LOWDER'S NIECE WAS MOREOVER ALERT TO SUPPLY
2514-149482-0040 WHILE DENSHER HIMSELF WAS FREELY APPEALED TO AS THE MOST PRIVILEGED AFTER ALL OF THE GROUP WASN'T IT HE WHO HAD IN A MANNER INVENTED THE WONDERFUL CREATURE THROUGH HAVING SEEN HER FIRST CAUGHT HER IN HER NATIVE JUNGLE HADN'T HE MORE OR LESS PAVED THE WAY
2514-149482-0041 FOR HER BY HIS PROMPT RECOGNITION OF HER RARITY BY PRECEDING HER IN A FRIENDLY SPIRIT AS HE HAD THE EAR OF SOCIETY WITH A SHARP FLASHLIGHT OR TWO HE MET POOR DENSHER THESE ENQUIRIES AS HE COULD
2514-149482-0042 LISTENING WITH INTEREST YET WITH DISCOMFORT WINCING IN PARTICULAR DRY JOURNALIST AS HE WAS TO FIND IT SEEMINGLY SUPPOSED OF HIM THAT HE HAD PUT HIS PEN OH HIS PEN AT THE SERVICE OF PRIVATE DISTINCTION THE EAR OF SOCIETY
2514-149482-0043 THEY WERE TALKING OR ALMOST AS IF HE HAD PUBLICLY PARAGRAPHED A MODEST YOUNG LADY THEY DREAMT DREAMS IN TRUTH HE APPEARED TO PERCEIVE THAT FAIRLY WAKED HIM UP AND HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS PLACE
2514-149482-0044 BOTH TO RESIST HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND TO CATCH THE FULL REVELATION HIS EMBARRASSMENT CAME NATURALLY FROM THE FACT THAT IF HE COULD CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR MISS THEALE'S SUCCESS SO NEITHER COULD HE GRACEFULLY INSIST ON HIS NOT HAVING BEEN CONCERNED WITH HER
2514-149482-0045 MISSUS LOWDER HAD WONDERS TO TELL OF IT THE TWO WEARERS OF THE WAISTCOAT EITHER WITH SINCERITY OR WITH HYPOCRISY PROFESSED IN THE MATTER AN EQUAL EXPERTNESS AND DENSHER AT LAST SEEMED TO KNOW HIMSELF IN PRESENCE OF A SOCIAL CASE
2514-149482-0046 IT WAS MISSUS STRINGHAM OBVIOUSLY WHOSE TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST INVOKED HADN'T SHE BEEN AS HER FRIEND'S REPRESENTATIVE RATHER CONFINED TO THE FUNCTION OF INHALING THE INCENSE SO THAT KATE
2514-149482-0047 WHO TREATED HER BEAUTIFULLY SMILING AT HER CHEERING AND CONSOLING HER ACROSS THE TABLE APPEARED BENEVOLENTLY BOTH TO SPEAK AND TO INTERPRET FOR HER KATE SPOKE AS IF SHE WOULDN'T PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THEIR WAY OF APPRECIATING MILLY
2514-149482-0048 BUT WOULD LET THEM NONE THE LESS IN JUSTICE TO THEIR GOOD WILL EXPRESS IT IN THEIR COARSER FASHION DENSHER HIMSELF WASN'T UNCONSCIOUS IN RESPECT TO THIS OF A CERTAIN BROAD BROTHERHOOD WITH MISSUS STRINGHAM WONDERING INDEED WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE TALK HOW
2514-149482-0049 IT MIGHT MOVE AMERICAN NERVES HE HAD ONLY HEARD OF THEM BEFORE BUT IN HIS RECENT TOUR HE HAD CAUGHT THEM IN THE REMARKABLE FACT AND THERE WAS NOW A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN IT CAME TO HIM THAT HE HAD PERHAPS AND NOT IN THE WAY OF AN ESCAPE
2514-149482-0050 TAKEN A LESSON FROM THEM THEY QUIVERED CLEARLY THEY HUMMED AND DRUMMED THEY LEAPED AND BOUNDED IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S TYPICAL ORGANISM THIS LADY STRIKING HIM AS BEFORE ALL THINGS EXCITED AS IN THE NATIVE PHRASE KEYED UP
2514-149482-0051 TO A PERCEPTION OF MORE ELEMENTS IN THE OCCASION THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ABLE TO COUNT SHE WAS ACCESSIBLE TO SIDES OF IT HE IMAGINED THAT WERE AS YET OBSCURE TO HIM FOR THOUGH SHE UNMISTAKEABLY REJOICED AND SOARED
2514-149482-0052 HER LITTLE DRY NEW ENGLAND BRIGHTNESS HE HAD SAMPLED ALL THE SHADES OF THE AMERICAN COMPLEXITY IF COMPLEXITY IT WERE HAD ITS ACTUAL REASONS FOR FINDING RELIEF MOST IN SILENCE
2514-149482-0053 SO THAT BEFORE THE SUBJECT WAS CHANGED HE PERCEIVED WITH SURPRISE AT THE OTHERS THAT THEY HAD GIVEN HER ENOUGH OF IT
2514-149482-0054 HAD REALLY NOT MADE IN HER OWN COUNTRY THE MARK SHE HAD CHALKED SO LARGE IN LONDON
2514-149482-0055 WHILE HE SCARCE KNEW IF HE WERE THE MORE IMPRESSED WITH HER LAUNCHING IT UNDER MISSUS STRINGHAM'S NOSE OR WITH HER HOPE THAT HE WOULD ALLOW TO LONDON THE HONOUR OF DISCOVERY THE LESS EXPANSIVE OF THE WHITE WAISTCOATS PROPOUNDED THE THEORY THAT THEY SAW IN LONDON
2514-149482-0056 FOR ALL THAT WAS SAID MUCH FURTHER THAN IN THE STATES IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HE URGED THAT THEY HAD TAUGHT THE AMERICANS TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FUNNY SOME NATIVE PRODUCT
2514-149482-0057 BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS
2514-149482-0058 THEY SOMETIMES SENT OUT BEAUTIES AND CELEBRITIES WHO LEFT THE BRITON COLD THE BRITON'S TEMPERATURE IN TRUTH WASN'T TO BE CALCULATED A FORMULATION OF THE MATTER THAT WAS NOT REACHED
2514-149482-0059 SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE POINT OF VIEW FOR A PROPER ADMIRATION OF HER YOUNG FRIEND HAD SEEMED TO FAIL A LITTLE IN NEW YORK THERE WAS NO MANNER OF DOUBT OF HER HAVING CARRIED BOSTON BY STORM
2514-149482-0060 IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING
2514-149482-0061 THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND
2514-149482-0062 HE HADN'T PRETENDED HE DID BUT THERE WAS A PURITY OF REPROACH IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S FACE AND TONE A PURITY CHARGED APPARENTLY WITH SOLEMN MEANINGS SO THAT FOR A LITTLE SMALL AS HAD BEEN HIS CLAIM HE COULDN'T BUT FEEL THAT SHE EXAGGERATED
2514-149482-0063 BUT WHILE DOING SO HE DEFENDED HIMSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ENORMOUSLY MUCH BEYOND HER HAVING BEEN MOST KIND TO ME IN NEW YORK AS A POOR BEWILDERED AND NEWLY LANDED ALIEN
2514-149482-0064 AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION
2514-149482-0065 THOUGH WHAT IT EXPRESSED HE FAILED AT THE TIME TO MAKE OUT YOU WEREN'T PRESENT THEN DEAREST MISSUS LOWDER RICHLY CONCURRED YOU DON'T KNOW SHE CONTINUED WITH MELLOW GAIETY HOW FAR THINGS MAY HAVE GONE
2514-149482-0066 IT MADE THE LITTLE WOMAN HE COULD SEE REALLY LOSE HER HEAD SHE HAD MORE THINGS IN THAT HEAD THAN ANY OF THEM IN ANY OTHER UNLESS PERHAPS IT WERE KATE WHOM HE FELT AS INDIRECTLY WATCHING HIM DURING THIS FOOLISH PASSAGE
2514-149482-0067 AND BECAUSE OF THE FOOLISHNESS NOT TO MEET HER EYES HE MET MISSUS STRINGHAM'S WHICH AFFECTED HIM WITH HER HE COULD ON OCCASION CLEAR IT UP A SENSE PRODUCED BY THE MUTE COMMUNION BETWEEN THEM AND
2514-149482-0068 REALLY THE BEGINNING AS THE EVENT WAS TO SHOW OF SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS EVEN ALREADY A LITTLE THE EFFECT OF THIS COMMUNION THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM PERCEPTIBLY FALTERED IN HER RETORT TO MISSUS LOWDER'S JOKE
2514-149482-0069 OH IT'S PRECISELY MY POINT THAT MISTER DENSHER CAN'T HAVE HAD VAST OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SHE SMILED AT HIM I WASN'T AWAY YOU KNOW LONG IT MADE EVERYTHING IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY RIGHT FOR HIM
2514-149482-0070 AND I WASN'T THERE LONG EITHER HE POSITIVELY SAW WITH IT THAT NOTHING FOR HIM SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED WOULD AGAIN BE WRONG SHE'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T SAY SHE'S EASY TO KNOW
2514-149482-0071 AS IF NOW TO KEEP WELL WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING BETTER SHE WAS OFF WITH YOU TO THESE PARTS BEFORE I KNEW IT I MYSELF WAS OFF TOO AWAY OFF TO WONDERFUL PARTS WHERE I HAD ENDLESSLY MORE TO SEE
2514-149482-0072 BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS
2514-149482-0073 SHE'LL THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR SAID MISSUS STRINGHAM WITH A FLUSHED FIRMNESS YET DOESN'T SILENCE IN SUCH A CASE AUNT MAUD BLANDLY ENQUIRED VERY OFTEN QUITE PROVE THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION
2514-149482-0074 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSED HADN'T HE BEEN SLIGHTLY DISPLEASED AT ALL THEY SEEMED DESIROUS TO FASTEN ON HIM WELL THE IMPRESSION WAS AS DEEP AS YOU LIKE BUT I REALLY WANT MISS THEALE TO KNOW HE PURSUED FOR MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT I DON'T FIGURE BY ANY CONSENT OF MY OWN
2514-149482-0075 KATE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE IF ASSISTANCE IT WAS BEFORE THEIR FRIEND HAD HAD TIME TO MEET THIS CHARGE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER NOT BEING EASY TO KNOW ONE SEES HER WITH INTENSITY SEES HER MORE THAN ONE SEES ALMOST ANY ONE BUT THEN ONE DISCOVERS
2514-149482-0076 THAT THAT ISN'T KNOWING HER AND THAT ONE MAY KNOW BETTER A PERSON WHOM ONE DOESN'T SEE AS I SAY HALF SO MUCH THE DISCRIMINATION WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE FACT OF HER SUCCESS AND IT WAS AT THAT COMPARATIVELY GROSS CIRCUMSTANCE
2514-149482-0077 NOW SO FULLY PLACED BEFORE THEM THAT MILLY'S ANXIOUS COMPANION SAT AND LOOKED LOOKED VERY MUCH AS SOME SPECTATOR IN AN OLD TIME CIRCUS MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ODDITY OF A CHRISTIAN MAIDEN IN THE ARENA MILDLY CARESSINGLY MARTYRED
2514-149482-0078 IT WAS THE NOSING AND FUMBLING NOT OF LIONS AND TIGERS BUT OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS LET LOOSE AS FOR THE JOKE EVEN THE JOKE MADE MISSUS STRINGHAM UNEASY AND HER MUTE COMMUNION WITH DENSHER TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED
2514-149482-0079 HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
2514-149482-0080 IF SHE ACTUALLY MISSED AT ANY RATE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S DISCOMFORT THAT BUT SHOWED HOW HER OWN IDEA HELD HER HER OWN IDEA WAS BY INSISTING ON THE FACT OF THE GIRL'S PROMINENCE AS A FEATURE OF THE SEASON'S END
2514-149482-0081 TO KEEP DENSHER IN RELATION FOR THE REST OF THEM BOTH TO PRESENT AND TO PAST IT'S EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT MAKES YOU NATURALLY A LITTLE SHY ABOUT HER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BUT WE DO WE'VE SEEN IT AND FOLLOWED IT
2514-149482-0082 WE'VE A LITTLE BEEN OF IT THE GREAT THING FOR HIM AT THIS AS KATE GAVE IT WAS IN FACT QUITE IRRESISTIBLY THAT THE CASE WAS A REAL ONE THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN ONE'S PATIENCE WAS SHORTER THAN ONE'S CURIOSITY
2514-149482-0083 ONE HAD VAGUELY TAKEN FOR POSSIBLE IN LONDON BUT IN WHICH ONE HAD NEVER BEEN EVEN TO THIS SMALL EXTENT CONCERNED THE LITTLE AMERICAN'S SUDDEN SOCIAL ADVENTURE HER HAPPY AND NO DOUBT HARMLESS FLOURISH
2514-149482-0084 HAD PROBABLY BEEN FAVOURED BY SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BUT IT HAD BEEN FAVOURED ABOVE ALL BY THE SIMPLE SPRING BOARD OF THE SCENE BY ONE OF THOSE COMMON CAPRICES OF THE NUMBERLESS FOOLISH FLOCK GREGARIOUS MOVEMENTS AS INSCRUTABLE
2514-149482-0085 AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY
2514-149482-0086 BUT THE GREAT REASON WAS PROBABLY THE ABSENCE AT THE MOMENT OF A LARGER LION THE BIGGER BEAST WOULD COME AND THE SMALLER WOULD THEN INCONTINENTLY VANISH IT WAS AT ALL EVENTS CHARACTERISTIC
2514-149482-0087 AND WHAT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF IT WAS GRIST TO HIS SCRIBBLING MILL MATTER FOR HIS JOURNALISING HAND THAT HAND ALREADY IN INTENTION PLAYED OVER IT THE MOTIVE AS A SIGN OF THE SEASON A FEATURE OF THE TIME OF THE PURELY EXPEDITIOUS
2514-149482-0088 AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
2514-149482-0089 THE AUTHOR OF THE ROTTEN BOOK THE BEAUTY WHO WAS NO BEAUTY THE HEIRESS WHO WAS ONLY THAT THE STRANGER WHO WAS FOR THE MOST PART SAVED FROM BEING INCONVENIENTLY STRANGE BUT BY BEING INCONVENIENTLY FAMILIAR
2514-149482-0090 THE CREATURE IN FINE AS TO WHOM SPANGLES OR SPOTS OF ANY SUFFICIENTLY MARKED AND EXHIBITED SORT COULD BE LOUDLY ENOUGH PREDICATED
2514-149482-0091 AND THE TONE OF SOCIETY WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE HIM TAKE UP AGAIN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF CIVILISED BUT IF THIS WAS CIVILISATION ONE COULD SMOKE ONE'S PIPE OUTSIDE WHEN TWADDLE WAS WITHIN
2514-149482-0092 HE HAD RATHER AVOIDED AS WE HAVE REMARKED KATE'S EYES BUT THERE CAME A MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD FAIRLY HAVE LIKED TO PUT IT ACROSS THE TABLE TO HER I SAY LIGHT OF MY LIFE IS THIS THE GREAT WORLD
2514-149482-0093 THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
2514-149482-0094 NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS
2514-149482-0095 SHE ENUNCIATED TO RELIEVE HIS BEWILDERMENT THE OBVIOUS TRUTH THAT YOU COULDN'T LEAVE LONDON FOR THREE MONTHS AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AND COME BACK TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS JUST WHERE THEY WERE AS THEY HAD OF COURSE BEEN JIGGING AWAY
2514-149482-0096 THEY MIGHT WELL BE SO RED IN THE FACE THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEM SHE RECONCILED IN FINE HIS DISCLAIMER ABOUT MILLY WITH THAT HONOUR OF HAVING DISCOVERED HER WHICH IT WAS VAIN FOR HIM MODESTLY TO SHIRK HE HAD UNEARTHED HER
2514-149482-0097 BUT IT WAS THEY ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WHO HAD DEVELOPED HER SHE WAS ALWAYS A CHARMER ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SEEN BUT SHE WASN'T THE PERSON HE HAD BACKED
2514-149482-0098 DENSHER WAS TO FEEL SURE AFTERWARDS THAT KATE HAD HAD IN THESE PLEASANTRIES NO CONSCIOUS ABOVE ALL NO INSOLENT PURPOSE OF MAKING LIGHT OF POOR SUSAN SHEPHERD'S PROPERTY IN THEIR YOUNG FRIEND WHICH PROPERTY BY SUCH REMARKS
2514-149482-0099 WAS VERY MUCH PUSHED TO THE WALL BUT HE WAS ALSO TO KNOW THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM HAD SECRETLY RESENTED THEM MISSUS STRINGHAM HOLDING THE OPINION OF WHICH HE WAS ULTIMATELY TO HAVE A GLIMPSE THAT ALL THE KATE CROYS IN CHRISTENDOM WERE BUT DUST FOR THE FEET OF HER MILLY
2514-149482-0100 THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL
2514-149482-0101 SHE SLIPPED IN THE OBSERVATION THAT HER MILLY WAS INCAPABLE OF CHANGE WAS JUST EXACTLY ON THE CONTRARY
2514-149482-0102 SHE WAS PERFECTLY KIND TO SUSIE IT WAS AS IF SHE POSITIVELY KNEW HER AS HANDICAPPED FOR ANY DISAGREEMENT BY FEELING THAT SHE KATE HAD TYPE AND BY BEING COMMITTED TO ADMIRATION OF TYPE
2514-149482-0103 KATE HAD OCCASION SUBSEQUENTLY SHE FOUND IT SOMEHOW TO MENTION TO OUR YOUNG MAN MILLY'S HAVING SPOKEN TO HER OF THIS VIEW ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART SHE WOULD LIKE MILLY HAD HAD IT FROM HER TO PUT KATE CROY IN A BOOK AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SO DO WITH HER
2514-149482-0104 CHOP ME UP FINE OR SERVE ME WHOLE IT WAS A WAY OF BEING GOT AT THAT KATE PROFESSED SHE DREADED IT WOULD BE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S HOWEVER SHE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE MISSUS STRINGHAM ODDLY FELT
2514-149482-0105 THAT WITH SUCH STUFF AS THE STRANGE ENGLISH GIRL WAS MADE OF STUFF THAT IN SPITE OF MAUD MANNINGHAM WHO WAS FULL OF SENTIMENT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN THERE WAS NONE OTHER TO BE EMPLOYED THESE THINGS WERE OF LATER EVIDENCE
2514-149482-0106 YET DENSHER MIGHT EVEN THEN HAVE FELT THEM IN THE AIR THEY WERE PRACTICALLY IN IT ALREADY WHEN KATE WAIVING THE QUESTION OF HER FRIEND'S CHEMICAL CHANGE WOUND UP WITH THE COMPARATIVELY UNOBJECTIONABLE PROPOSITION THAT HE MUST NOW HAVING MISSED SO MUCH
2514-149482-0107 TAKE THEM ALL UP ON TRUST FURTHER ON HE MET IT PEACEFULLY A LITTLE PERHAPS AS AN EXAMPLE TO MISSUS STRINGHAM OH AS FAR ON AS YOU LIKE THIS EVEN HAD ITS EFFECT MISSUS STRINGHAM APPROPRIATED AS MUCH OF IT AS MIGHT BE MEANT FOR HERSELF
302-123504-0000 A FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDS THE THING WHICH MORE NEARLY RESEMBLED OUR EARTHLY MEN THAN IT DID THE MARTIANS I HAD SEEN HELD ME PINIONED TO THE GROUND WITH ONE HUGE FOOT
302-123504-0001 WHILE IT JABBERED AND GESTICULATED AT SOME ANSWERING CREATURE BEHIND ME THIS OTHER WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY ITS MATE SOON CAME TOWARD US BEARING A MIGHTY STONE CUDGEL
302-123504-0002 WITH WHICH IT EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO BRAIN ME THE CREATURES WERE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET TALL STANDING ERECT AND HAD LIKE THE GREEN MARTIANS AN INTERMEDIARY SET OF ARMS OR LEGS
302-123504-0003 MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS THEIR EYES WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND NON PROTRUDING THEIR EARS WERE HIGH SET BUT MORE LATERALLY LOCATED THAN THOSE OF THE MARTIANS
302-123504-0004 WHEN A BOLT OF MYRIAD LEGGED HORROR HURLED ITSELF THROUGH THE DOORWAY FULL UPON THE BREAST OF MY EXECUTIONER WITH A SHRIEK OF FEAR THE APE WHICH HELD ME LEAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW BUT ITS MATE CLOSED IN A TERRIFIC
302-123504-0005 DEATH STRUGGLE WITH MY PRESERVER WHICH WAS NOTHING LESS THAN MY FAITHFUL WATCH THING I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL SO HIDEOUS A CREATURE A DOG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I GAINED MY FEET AND BACKING AGAINST THE WALL I WITNESSED SUCH A
302-123504-0006 BATTLE AS IT IS VOUCHSAFED FEW BEINGS TO SEE THE STRENGTH AGILITY AND BLIND FEROCITY OF THESE TWO CREATURES IS APPROACHED BY NOTHING KNOWN TO EARTHLY MAN
302-123504-0007 MY BEAST HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS FIRST HOLD HAVING SUNK HIS MIGHTY FANGS FAR INTO THE BREAST OF HIS ADVERSARY BUT THE GREAT ARMS AND PAWS OF THE APE
302-123504-0008 BACKED BY MUSCLES FAR TRANSCENDING THOSE OF THE MARTIAN MEN I HAD SEEN HAD LOCKED THE THROAT OF MY GUARDIAN AND SLOWLY WERE CHOKING OUT HIS LIFE AND BENDING BACK HIS HEAD AND NECK UPON HIS BODY
302-123504-0009 WHERE I MOMENTARILY EXPECTED THE FORMER TO FALL LIMP AT THE END OF A BROKEN NECK IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS THE APE WAS TEARING AWAY THE ENTIRE FRONT OF ITS BREAST WHICH WAS HELD IN THE VISE LIKE GRIP OF THE POWERFUL JAWS
302-123504-0010 BACK AND FORTH UPON THE FLOOR THEY ROLLED NEITHER ONE EMITTING A SOUND OF FEAR OR PAIN PRESENTLY I SAW THE GREAT EYES OF MY BEAST BULGING COMPLETELY FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND BLOOD FLOWING FROM ITS NOSTRILS
302-123504-0011 BUT SO ALSO WAS THE APE WHOSE STRUGGLES WERE GROWING MOMENTARILY LESS SUDDENLY I CAME TO MYSELF
302-123504-0012 I SEIZED THE CUDGEL WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE BATTLE AND SWINGING IT WITH ALL THE POWER OF MY EARTHLY ARMS I CRASHED IT FULL UPON THE HEAD OF THE APE CRUSHING HIS SKULL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN EGGSHELL
302-123504-0013 SCARCELY HAD THE BLOW DESCENDED WHEN I WAS CONFRONTED WITH A NEW DANGER THE APE'S MATE RECOVERED FROM ITS FIRST SHOCK OF TERROR HAD RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF THE ENCOUNTER BY WAY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING
302-123504-0014 I GLIMPSED HIM JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOORWAY AND THE SIGHT OF HIM NOW ROARING AS HE PERCEIVED HIS LIFELESS FELLOW STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS RAGE FILLED ME I MUST CONFESS
302-123504-0015 WITH DIRE FOREBODINGS I AM EVER WILLING TO STAND AND FIGHT WHEN THE ODDS ARE NOT TOO OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I PERCEIVED NEITHER GLORY NOR PROFIT
302-123504-0016 AGAINST THE IRON MUSCLES AND BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THIS ENRAGED DENIZEN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN FACT THE ONLY OUTCOME OF SUCH AN ENCOUNTER SO FAR AS I MIGHT BE CONCERNED SEEMED SUDDEN DEATH
302-123504-0017 I WAS STANDING NEAR THE WINDOW AND I KNEW THAT ONCE IN THE STREET I MIGHT GAIN THE PLAZA AND SAFETY BEFORE THE CREATURE COULD OVERTAKE ME AT LEAST THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
302-123504-0018 AGAINST ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH SHOULD I REMAIN AND FIGHT HOWEVER DESPERATELY IT IS TRUE I HELD THE CUDGEL BUT WHAT COULD I DO WITH IT AGAINST HIS FOUR GREAT ARMS
302-123504-0019 EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
302-123504-0020 IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
302-123504-0021 HIS GREAT EYES FASTENED UPON ME IN WHAT SEEMED A PITIFUL APPEAL FOR PROTECTION I COULD NOT WITHSTAND THAT LOOK NOR COULD I ON SECOND THOUGHT HAVE DESERTED MY RESCUER WITHOUT GIVING AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF IN HIS BEHALF
302-123504-0022 AS HE HAD IN MINE WITHOUT MORE ADO THEREFORE I TURNED TO MEET THE CHARGE OF THE INFURIATED BULL APE HE WAS NOW TOO CLOSE UPON ME FOR THE CUDGEL TO PROVE OF ANY EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE
302-123504-0023 SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
302-123504-0024 WITH ARMS WIDE STRETCHED TO EASE HIS FALL AGAIN AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY I HAD RECOURSE TO EARTHLY TACTICS AND SWINGING MY RIGHT FIST FULL UPON THE POINT OF HIS CHIN
302-123504-0025 I BEHELD TARS TARKAS SOLA AND THREE OR FOUR WARRIORS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE CHAMBER AS MY EYES MET THEIRS I WAS FOR THE SECOND TIME THE RECIPIENT OF THEIR ZEALOUSLY GUARDED APPLAUSE
302-123504-0026 MY ABSENCE HAD BEEN NOTED BY SOLA ON HER AWAKENING AND SHE HAD QUICKLY INFORMED TARS TARKAS WHO HAD SET OUT IMMEDIATELY WITH A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS TO SEARCH FOR ME AS THEY HAD APPROACHED THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
302-123504-0027 THIS ENCOUNTER TOGETHER WITH MY SET TO WITH THE MARTIAN WARRIOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND MY FEATS OF JUMPING PLACED ME UPON A HIGH PINNACLE IN THEIR REGARD EVIDENTLY DEVOID OF ALL THE FINER SENTIMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP
302-123504-0028 LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
302-123504-0029 STRENGTH AND COURAGE SOLA WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED THE SEARCHING PARTY OF HER OWN VOLITION WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MARTIANS WHOSE FACE HAD NOT BEEN TWISTED IN LAUGHTER AS I BATTLED FOR MY LIFE SHE ON THE CONTRARY
302-123504-0030 WAS SOBER WITH APPARENT SOLICITUDE AND AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE MONSTER RUSHED TO ME AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED MY BODY FOR POSSIBLE WOUNDS OR INJURIES SATISFYING HERSELF THAT I HAD COME OFF UNSCATHED SHE SMILED QUIETLY
302-123504-0031 AND TAKING MY HAND STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER TARS TARKAS AND THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD ENTERED AND WERE STANDING OVER THE NOW RAPIDLY REVIVING BRUTE WHICH HAD SAVED MY LIFE
302-123504-0032 THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
302-123504-0033 AND TURNED TO FOLLOW US FROM THE ROOM THERE SEEMED SOMETHING MENACING IN THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD MY BEAST AND I HESITATED TO LEAVE UNTIL I HAD LEARNED THE OUTCOME IT WAS WELL I DID SO FOR THE WARRIOR DREW AN
302-123504-0034 EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
302-123504-0035 BLOWING A HOLE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WOOD AND MASONRY I THEN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE FEARSOME LOOKING THING AND RAISING IT TO ITS FEET MOTIONED FOR IT TO FOLLOW ME
302-123504-0036 AND SOLA GRASPING ME TIGHTLY BY THE ARM I HAD AT LEAST TWO FRIENDS ON MARS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WATCHED OVER ME WITH MOTHERLY SOLICITUDE AND A DUMB BRUTE WHICH AS I LATER CAME TO KNOW
302-123504-0037 HELD IN ITS POOR UGLY CARCASS MORE LOVE MORE LOYALTY MORE GRATITUDE
302-123516-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHAINED IN WARHOON IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
302-123516-0001 AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
302-123516-0002 RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
302-123516-0003 HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
302-123516-0004 AND DEPENDING FROM THESE A NUMBER OF DRIED HUMAN HANDS HIS REFERENCE TO THE GREAT GAMES OF WHICH I HAD HEARD SO MUCH WHILE AMONG THE THARKS CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD BUT JUMPED FROM PURGATORY INTO GEHENNA
302-123516-0005 AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH THE FEMALE DURING WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOW FULLY FIT TO TRAVEL THE JED ORDERED THAT WE MOUNT AND RIDE AFTER THE MAIN COLUMN
302-123516-0006 I WAS STRAPPED SECURELY TO AS WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE A THOAT AS I HAD EVER SEEN AND WITH A MOUNTED WARRIOR ON EITHER SIDE TO PREVENT THE BEAST FROM BOLTING
302-123516-0007 WE RODE FORTH AT A FURIOUS PACE IN PURSUIT OF THE COLUMN MY WOUNDS GAVE ME BUT LITTLE PAIN SO WONDERFULLY AND RAPIDLY HAD THE APPLICATIONS AND INJECTIONS OF THE FEMALE EXERCISED THEIR THERAPEUTIC POWERS
302-123516-0008 WHO PROVED TO BE THE JEDDAK OF THE HORDES OF WARHOON LIKE THE JED WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY SCARRED AND ALSO DECORATED WITH THE BREASTPLATE OF HUMAN SKULLS AND DRIED DEAD HANDS
302-123516-0009 WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
302-123516-0010 WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
302-123516-0011 HE ENTIRELY OMITTED THE USUAL FORMAL SALUTATION AS WE ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE JEDDAK AND AS HE PUSHED ME ROUGHLY BEFORE THE RULER HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD AND MENACING VOICE
302-123516-0012 I HAVE BROUGHT A STRANGE CREATURE WEARING THE METAL OF A THARK WHOM IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAVE BATTLE WITH A WILD THOAT AT THE GREAT GAMES HE WILL DIE AS BAR COMAS YOUR JEDDAK SEES FIT IF AT ALL
302-123516-0013 WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
302-123516-0014 RATHER THAN BY A WATER HEARTED WEAKLING FROM WHOM EVEN OLD DAK KOVA COULD TEAR THE METAL WITH HIS BARE HANDS BAR COMAS EYED THE DEFIANT AND INSUBORDINATE CHIEFTAIN FOR AN INSTANT HIS EXPRESSION ONE OF HAUGHTY
302-123516-0015 FEARLESS CONTEMPT AND HATE AND THEN WITHOUT DRAWING A WEAPON AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE HURLED HIMSELF AT THE THROAT OF HIS DEFAMER
302-123516-0016 I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN TWO GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS BATTLE WITH NATURE'S WEAPONS AND THE EXHIBITION OF ANIMAL FEROCITY WHICH ENSUED WAS AS FEARFUL A THING AS THE MOST DISORDERED IMAGINATION COULD PICTURE
302-123516-0017 BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
302-123516-0018 BREAKING AWAY FROM A CLINCH IT WAS THE ONE LITTLE OPENING THAT DAK KOVA NEEDED AND HURLING HIMSELF AT THE BODY OF HIS ADVERSARY
302-123516-0019 AND WITH A LAST POWERFUL EFFORT RIPPED THE YOUNG JEDDAK WIDE OPEN THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BODY THE GREAT TUSK
302-123516-0020 VICTOR AND VANQUISHED ROLLED LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE MOSS A HUGE MASS OF TORN AND BLOODY FLESH
302-123516-0021 BAR COMAS WAS STONE DEAD AND ONLY THE MOST HERCULEAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF DAK KOVA'S FEMALES SAVED HIM FROM THE FATE HE DESERVED THREE DAYS LATER HE WALKED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO THE BODY OF BAR COMAS WHICH
302-123516-0022 BY CUSTOM HAD NOT BEEN MOVED FROM WHERE IT FELL AND PLACING HIS FOOT UPON THE NECK OF HIS ERSTWHILE RULER HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF JEDDAK OF WARHOON
302-123516-0023 THE INJURIES TO DAK KOVA HAD DELAYED THE MARCH SO GREATLY THAT IT WAS DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHICH WAS A RAID UPON A SMALL THARK COMMUNITY IN RETALIATION FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INCUBATOR UNTIL AFTER THE GREAT GAMES
302-123516-0024 THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
302-123516-0025 FOOD WAS BROUGHT ME AT INTERVALS BUT OWING TO THE UTTER DARKNESS OF THE PLACE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I LAY THERE DAYS OR WEEKS OR MONTHS IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF ALL MY LIFE
302-123516-0026 AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
302-123516-0027 AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
302-123516-0028 ALTHOUGH I AT FIRST BOMBARDED HIM WITH QUESTIONS FINALLY ALL THE HATRED AND MANIACAL LOATHING FOR THESE AWFUL CREATURES WHO HAD PLACED ME IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WAS CENTERED BY MY TOTTERING REASON UPON THIS SINGLE EMISSARY
302-123516-0029 WHO REPRESENTED TO ME THE ENTIRE HORDE OF WARHOONS I HAD NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS ADVANCED WITH HIS DIM TORCH TO WHERE HE COULD PLACE THE FOOD WITHIN MY REACH AND AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE IT UPON THE FLOOR
302-123516-0030 SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
302-123516-0031 I WAITED HIS COMING CROUCHING LIKE SOME BEAST OF PREY AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE MY FOOD UPON THE GROUND I SWUNG THE CHAIN ABOVE MY HEAD AND CRASHED THE LINKS WITH ALL MY STRENGTH UPON HIS SKULL WITHOUT A SOUND
302-123516-0032 HE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR STONE DEAD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING LIKE THE IDIOT I WAS FAST BECOMING
302-123516-0033 NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
302-123516-0034 BACK INTO MY CORNER I CROUCHED
302-123516-0035 AND STEALTHILY ON CAME THE AWFUL EYES UNTIL THEY REACHED THE DEAD BODY AT MY FEET THEN SLOWLY THEY RETREATED BUT THIS TIME WITH A STRANGE GRATING SOUND
302-123523-0000 THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
302-123523-0001 WHICH I NEGOTIATED EASILY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE ONCE INSIDE HOWEVER THE GATE GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
302-123523-0002 AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS
302-123523-0003 THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
302-123523-0004 AND SO I CAME CLOSE AND PEERED WITHIN AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS SAT THAN KOSIS AND HIS CONSORT
302-123523-0005 SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
302-123523-0006 THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
302-123523-0007 AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
302-123523-0008 TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
302-123523-0009 THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
302-123523-0010 FOR IT WAS SAB THAN PRINCE OF ZODANGA WHO STOOD REVEALED BEFORE ME THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS AND PLACED ONE OF THE COLLARS OF GOLD ABOUT HIS SON'S NECK
302-123523-0011 SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
302-123523-0012 BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
302-123523-0013 I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
302-123523-0014 RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0015 WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
302-123523-0016 BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0017 AND AGAIN WE FACED EACH OTHER HE WAS SOON JOINED BY A QUARTET OF OFFICERS AND WITH MY BACK AGAINST A GOLDEN THRONE I FOUGHT ONCE AGAIN FOR DEJAH THORIS I WAS HARD PRESSED TO DEFEND MYSELF
302-123523-0018 AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN
302-123523-0019 WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
302-123523-0020 CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
302-123523-0021 THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
302-123523-0022 WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET
302-123523-0023 NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
302-123523-0024 AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
302-123523-0025 AND LEAVING DEJAH THORIS IN CHARGE OF TARS TARKAS I TOOK A DOZEN WARRIORS AND HASTENED TO THE DUNGEONS BENEATH THE PALACE THE JAILERS HAD ALL LEFT TO JOIN THE FIGHTERS IN THE THRONE ROOM SO WE SEARCHED THE LABYRINTHINE PRISON WITHOUT OPPOSITION
302-123523-0026 I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
302-123523-0027 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
302-123523-0028 SO THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN SAB THAN WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT AWAY THE BARS AND CHAINS WHICH HELD HIM PRISONER SO AT HIS SUGGESTION
302-123523-0029 FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
302-123523-0030 AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
302-123523-0031 CAN IT BE THAT ALL EARTH MEN ARE AS YOU ALONE A STRANGER HUNTED THREATENED PERSECUTED YOU HAVE DONE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS WHAT IN ALL THE PAST AGES OF BARSOOM NO MAN HAS EVER DONE
302-123523-0032 JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
302-123523-0033 LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
302-123523-0034 FOR I AM FREE AND MORE STILL I HAVE TO SAY ERE IT IS AGAIN TOO LATE I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED
302-123523-0035 BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF FOR NEVER HAD I DREAMED THAT IN ALL THE UNIVERSE DWELT SUCH A WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM
302-123523-0036 BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME DOUBT MY SANITY AS I ASK YOU MY PRINCESS TO BE MINE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ABASHED WHO SO WELL KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS PLEA
302-123523-0037 BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
302-123523-0038 WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
3240-131231-0000 ATTEMPTS TO PRESERVE THE SYSTEM THAT SMALL FROGS AND TOADS FOR INSTANCE NEVER HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY BUT WERE ON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE OR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH FALLS UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
3240-131231-0001 WERE THERE SOME ESPECIALLY FROGGY PLACE NEAR EUROPE AS THERE IS AN ESPECIALLY SANDY PLACE THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION WOULD OF COURSE BE THAT ALL SMALL FROGS FALLING FROM THE SKY IN EUROPE COME FROM THAT CENTER OF FROGEITY TO START WITH
3240-131231-0002 I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT I AM PERMITTED TO SEE BECAUSE I AM STILL PRIMITIVE OR INTELLIGENT OR IN A STATE OF MALADJUSTMENT
3240-131231-0003 OF A FALL OF TADPOLES FROM THE SKY AS TO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0004 THE WRITER SAYS THAT ALL OBSERVERS WERE MISTAKEN THAT THE FROGS OR TOADS MUST HAVE FALLEN FROM TREES OR OTHER PLACES OVERHEAD TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF LITTLE TOADS ONE OR TWO MONTHS OLD
3240-131231-0005 THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM A GREAT THICK CLOUD THAT APPEARED SUDDENLY IN A SKY THAT HAD BEEN CLOUDLESS AUGUST EIGHTEEN O FOUR NEAR TOULOUSE FRANCE ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM PROFESSOR PONTUS TO M ARAGO
3240-131231-0006 MANY INSTANCES OF FROGS THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0007 AS TO HAVING BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0008 JULY THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0009 LITTLE TOADS FOUND IN A DESERT AFTER A RAINFALL NOTES AND QUERIES
3240-131231-0010 TO START WITH I DO NOT DENY POSITIVELY THE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION OF UP AND DOWN I THINK THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SUCH OCCURRENCES I OMIT MANY NOTES THAT I HAVE UPON INDISTINGUISHABLES
3240-131231-0011 IN THE LONDON TIMES JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF A SHOWER OF TWIGS AND LEAVES AND TINY TOADS IN A STORM UPON THE SLOPES OF THE APENNINES THESE MAY HAVE BEEN THE EJECTAMENTA OF A WHIRLWIND I ADD HOWEVER
3240-131231-0012 THAT I HAVE NOTES UPON TWO OTHER FALLS OF TINY TOADS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE ONE IN FRANCE AND ONE IN TAHITI ALSO OF FISH IN SCOTLAND BUT IN THE PHENOMENON OF THE APENNINES THE MIXTURE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF THE PRODUCTS OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0013 THE OTHER INSTANCES SEEM TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF SOMETHING LIKE MIGRATION THEIR GREAT NUMBERS AND THEIR HOMOGENEITY OVER AND OVER IN THESE ANNALS OF THE DAMNED OCCURS THE DATUM OF SEGREGATION
3240-131231-0014 BUT A WHIRLWIND IS THOUGHT OF AS A CONDITION OF CHAOS QUASI CHAOS
3240-131231-0015 MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JULY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE A SMALL POND IN THE TRACK OF THE CLOUD WAS SUCKED DRY THE WATER BEING CARRIED OVER THE ADJOINING FIELDS TOGETHER WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF SOFT MUD WHICH WAS SCATTERED OVER THE GROUND FOR HALF A MILE AROUND
3240-131231-0016 BUT HERE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SCOOP IN THE EXCLUSIONIST IMAGINATION THERE IS NO REGARD FOR MUD DEBRIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF A POND FLOATING VEGETATION LOOSE THINGS FROM THE SHORES BUT A PRECISE PICKING OUT OF FROGS ONLY
3240-131231-0017 OF ALL INSTANCES I HAVE THAT ATTRIBUTE THE FALL OF SMALL FROGS OR TOADS TO WHIRLWINDS ONLY ONE DEFINITELY IDENTIFIES OR PLACES THE WHIRLWIND ALSO AS HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE A POND GOING UP WOULD BE QUITE AS INTERESTING AS FROGS COMING DOWN
3240-131231-0018 WHIRLWINDS WE READ OF OVER AND OVER BUT WHERE AND WHAT WHIRLWIND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANYBODY WHO HAD LOST A POND WOULD BE HEARD FROM IN SYMONS METEOROLOGICAL MAGAZINE
3240-131231-0019 A FALL OF SMALL FROGS NEAR BIRMINGHAM ENGLAND JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO IS ATTRIBUTED TO A SPECIFIC WHIRLWIND BUT NOT A WORD AS TO ANY SPECIAL POND THAT HAD CONTRIBUTED
3240-131231-0020 AND SOMETHING THAT STRIKES MY ATTENTION HERE IS THAT THESE FROGS ARE DESCRIBED AS ALMOST WHITE I'M AFRAID THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR US WE SHALL HAVE TO GIVE TO CIVILIZATION UPON THIS EARTH SOME NEW WORLDS PLACES WITH WHITE FROGS IN THEM
3240-131231-0021 IN SPITE OF ALL WE THINK WE KNOW OF THE ACCELERATIVE VELOCITY OF FALLING BODIES AND HAVE PROPAGATED WHY THE EXOTIC BECOMES THE INDIGENOUS OR FROM THE STRANGEST OF PLACES WE'D EXPECT THE FAMILIAR OR
3240-131231-0022 IF HOSTS OF LIVING FROGS HAVE COME HERE FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE EVERY LIVING THING UPON THIS EARTH MAY ANCESTRALLY HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE I FIND THAT I HAVE ANOTHER NOTE UPON A SPECIFIC HURRICANE
3240-131231-0023 AFTER ONE OF THE GREATEST HURRICANES IN THE HISTORY OF IRELAND SOME FISH WERE FOUND AS FAR AS FIFTEEN YARDS FROM THE EDGE OF A LAKE HAVE ANOTHER THIS IS A GOOD ONE FOR THE EXCLUSIONISTS FALL OF FISH IN PARIS SAID THAT A NEIGHBORING POND HAD BEEN BLOWN DRY
3240-131231-0024 DATE NOT GIVEN BUT I HAVE SEEN IT RECORDED SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BEST KNOWN FALL OF FISHES FROM THE SKY IS THAT WHICH OCCURRED AT MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0025 FEBRUARY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE THE EDITOR OF THE ZOOLOGIST
3240-131231-0026 HAVING PUBLISHED A REPORT OF A FALL OF FISHES WRITES I AM CONTINUALLY RECEIVING SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF FROGS AND FISHES BUT IN ALL THE VOLUMES OF THE ZOOLOGIST I CAN FIND ONLY TWO REPORTS OF SUCH FALLS THERE IS NOTHING TO CONCLUDE
3240-131231-0027 OTHER THAN THAT HOSTS OF DATA HAVE BEEN LOST BECAUSE ORTHODOXY DOES NOT LOOK FAVORABLY UPON SUCH REPORTS THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW RECORDS SEVERAL FALLS OF FISHES IN THE UNITED STATES
3240-131231-0028 NEVERTHELESS THE TREATMENT BY THE ZOOLOGIST OF THE FALL REPORTED FROM MOUNTAIN ASH IS FAIR FIRST APPEARS
3240-131231-0029 VICAR OF ABEDARE ASSERTING THAT THE FALL HAD OCCURRED CHIEFLY UPON THE PROPERTY OF MISTER NIXON OF MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0030 OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BRISTLING WITH EXCLUSIONISM WRITES THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM ALIVE WERE VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HE SAYS ON READING THE EVIDENCE IT SEEMS TO ME MOST PROBABLY ONLY A PRACTICAL JOKE
3240-131231-0031 THE EDITOR SAYS THAT ONE WAS A MINNOW AND THAT THE REST WERE STICKLEBACKS HE SAYS THAT DOCTOR GRAY'S EXPLANATION IS NO DOUBT RIGHT BUT
3240-131231-0032 HE PUBLISHES A LETTER FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT WHO APOLOGIZES FOR OPPOSING SO HIGH AN AUTHORITY AS DOCTOR GRAY BUT SAYS THAT HE HAD OBTAINED SOME OF THESE FISHES FROM PERSONS WHO LIVED AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE APART
3240-131231-0033 OR CONSIDERABLY OUT OF RANGE OF THE PLAYFUL PAIL OF WATER ACCORDING TO THE ANNUAL REGISTER
3240-131231-0034 THE FISHES THEMSELVES HAD FALLEN BY PAILFULS IF THESE FISHES WERE NOT UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE WE BASE OUR OBJECTIONS TO THE WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION UPON TWO DATA THAT THEY FELL IN NO SUCH DISTRIBUTION AS ONE COULD ATTRIBUTE TO THE DISCHARGE OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0035 THAT TEN MINUTES LATER ANOTHER FALL OF FISHES OCCURRED UPON THIS SAME NARROW STRIP OF LAND EVEN ARGUING THAT A WHIRLWIND MAY STAND STILL AXIALLY IT DISCHARGES TANGENTIALLY WHEREVER THE FISHES CAME FROM IT DOES NOT SEEM THINKABLE
3240-131231-0036 THAT SOME COULD HAVE FALLEN AND THAT OTHERS COULD HAVE WHIRLED EVEN A TENTH OF A MINUTE THEN FALLING DIRECTLY AFTER THE FIRST TO FALL BECAUSE OF THESE EVIL CIRCUMSTANCES THE BEST ADAPTATION WAS TO LAUGH THE WHOLE THING OFF
3240-131231-0037 VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HAD BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH SECOND EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE IS A LETTER FROM MISTER AARON ROBERTS CURATE OF SAINT PETER'S CARMATHON IN THIS LETTER
3240-131231-0038 BUT THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF SPECIES I THINK MYSELF THAT THEY WERE MINNOWS AND STICKLEBACKS SOME PERSONS THINKING THEM TO BE SEA FISHES PLACED THEM IN SALT WATER ACCORDING TO MISTER ROBERTS
3240-131231-0039 SOME WERE PLACED IN FRESH WATER THESE SEEMED TO THRIVE WELL AS TO NARROW DISTRIBUTION WE ARE TOLD THAT THE FISHES FELL IN AND ABOUT THE PREMISES OF MISTER NIXON IT WAS NOT OBSERVED AT THE TIME THAT ANY FISH FELL IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
3240-131231-0040 SAVE IN THE PARTICULAR SPOT MENTIONED IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE VICAR GRIFFITH WRITES AN ACCOUNT THE ROOFS OF SOME HOUSES WERE COVERED WITH THEM
3240-131231-0041 IN THIS LETTER IT IS SAID THAT THE LARGEST FISHES WERE FIVE INCHES LONG AND THAT THESE DID NOT SURVIVE THE FALL REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION
3240-131231-0042 THE EVIDENCE OF THE FALL OF FISH ON THIS OCCASION WAS VERY CONCLUSIVE A SPECIMEN OF THE FISH WAS EXHIBITED
3240-131231-0043 LEIRUS GASTEROSTEUS IS THE STICKLEBACK ALTOGETHER I THINK WE HAVE NOT A SENSE OF TOTAL PERDITION
3240-131231-0044 IN WHICH WERE THOUSANDS OF FISHES FOUR OR FIVE INCHES LONG SOME OF WHICH COVERED ROOFS OF HOUSES AND SOME OF WHICH REMAINED TEN MINUTES IN THE AIR BY WAY OF CONTRAST WE OFFER OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE THAT THE BOTTOM OF A SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL POND HAD DROPPED OUT
3240-131231-0045 I HAVE A GREAT MANY NOTES UPON THE FALL OF FISHES DESPITE THE DIFFICULTY THESE RECORDS HAVE IN GETTING THEMSELVES PUBLISHED BUT I PICK OUT THE INSTANCES THAT ESPECIALLY RELATE TO OUR SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL ACCEPTANCES
3240-131231-0046 THAT HAVE FALLEN WITH A DISTRIBUTION NARROWER THAN IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A WHIRLWIND THAT HAVE FALLEN FOR A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME UPON THE SAME NARROW AREA OF LAND THESE THREE FACTORS INDICATE SOMEWHERE NOT FAR ALOFT
3240-131231-0047 A REGION OF INERTNESS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION OF COURSE HOWEVER A REGION THAT BY THE FLUX AND VARIATION OF ALL THINGS MUST AT TIMES BE SUSCEPTIBLE BUT AFTERWARD OUR HERESY WILL BIFURCATE
3240-131231-0048 IN AMIABLE ACCOMMODATION TO THE CRUCIFIXION IT'LL GET I THINK BUT SO IMPRESSED ARE WE WITH THE DATUM THAT THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF SMALL FROGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0049 THAT TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ANOTHER ADJUSTMENT MUST BE MADE APART FROM OUR THREE FACTORS OF INDICATION AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVATION IS THE FALL OF LIVING THINGS WITHOUT INJURY TO THEM
3240-131231-0050 SOMETHING ELSE APART FROM OUR THREE MAIN INTERESTS IS A PHENOMENON THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL AN ALTERNATING SERIES OF FALLS OF FISHES WHATEVER THE SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE
3240-131231-0051 JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0052 FIFESHIRE SCOTLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR
3240-131231-0053 MORADABAD INDIA JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0054 ROSS SHIRE SCOTLAND EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0055 MORADABAD INDIA JULY TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE
3240-131231-0056 FERIDPOOR INDIA FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY
3240-131231-0057 DISREGARDING SERIAL SIGNIFICANCE OR MECHANICAL UNINTELLIGENT REPULSIVE REFLEX IS THAT THE FISHES OF INDIA DID NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY WERE FOUND UPON THE GROUND AFTER TORRENTIAL RAINS BECAUSE STREAMS HAD OVERFLOWED AND HAD THEN RECEDED
3240-131231-0058 IN THE REGION OF INERTNESS THAT WE THINK WE CAN CONCEIVE OF OR A ZONE THAT IS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION VERY MUCH LIKE THE NEUTRAL ZONE OF A MAGNET'S ATTRACTION WE ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE BODIES OF WATER AND ALSO CLEAR SPACES BOTTOMS OF PONDS DROPPING OUT
3240-131231-0059 REMAIN AND DRY OR EVEN PUTREFY THEN SOMETIMES FALLING BY ATMOSPHERIC DISLODGMENT AFTER A TREMENDOUS DELUGE OF RAIN ONE OF THE HEAVIEST FALLS ON RECORD
3240-131231-0060 JULY TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY
3240-131231-0061 THE WORD FOUND IS AGREEABLE TO THE REPULSIONS OF THE CONVENTIONALISTS AND THEIR CONCEPT OF AN OVERFLOWING STREAM BUT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE FOUND ON THE TOPS OF HAYSTACKS FERREL
3240-131231-0062 TELLS OF A FALL OF LIVING FISHES SOME OF THEM HAVING BEEN PLACED IN A TANK WHERE THEY SURVIVED THAT OCCURRED IN INDIA ABOUT TWENTY MILES SOUTH OF CALCUTTA SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE A WITNESS OF THIS FALL SAYS
3240-131231-0063 THE MOST STRANGE THING WHICH EVER STRUCK ME WAS THAT THE FISH DID NOT FALL HELTER SKELTER OR HERE AND THERE BUT THEY FELL IN A STRAIGHT LINE NOT MORE THAN A CUBIT IN BREADTH
3240-131231-0064 THAT ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY TAKEN BEFORE A MAGISTRATE A FALL OCCURRED FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NEAR FERIDPOOR INDIA OF MANY FISHES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME WHOLE AND FRESH AND OTHERS MUTILATED AND PUTREFYING
3240-131231-0065 OR TO THOSE WHO HOLD OUT FOR SEGREGATION IN A WHIRLWIND OR THAT OBJECTS SAY TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE LIGHTER WE POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS IN THE JOURNAL OF THE ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL
3240-131231-0066 SOME OF THE FISH WERE FRESH BUT OTHERS WERE ROTTEN AND WITHOUT HEADS AMONG THE NUMBER WHICH I GOT FIVE WERE FRESH AND THE REST STINKING AND HEADLESS THEY REMIND US OF HIS GRACE'S OBSERVATION OF SOME PAGES BACK
3240-131231-0067 ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WEIGHED ONE AND A HALF POUNDS EACH AND OTHERS THREE POUNDS A FALL OF FISHES AT FUTTEPOOR INDIA MAY SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE THEY WERE ALL DEAD AND DRY
3240-131231-0068 A CORRESPONDENT WRITES FROM THE DOVE MARINE LABORATORY CUTTERCOATS ENGLAND THAT AT HINDON A SUBURB OF SUNDERLAND AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS OF SMALL FISHES IDENTIFIED AS SAND EELS HAD FALLEN
3240-131231-0069 AGAIN THE SMALL AREA ABOUT SIXTY BY THIRTY YARDS THE FALL OCCURRED DURING A HEAVY RAIN THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER
3240-131231-0070 BUT BY NO VISIBLE LIGHTNING THE SEA IS CLOSE TO HINDON BUT IF YOU TRY TO THINK OF THESE FISHES HAVING DESCRIBED A TRAJECTORY IN A WHIRLWIND FROM THE OCEAN CONSIDER THIS REMARKABLE DATUM THAT
3240-131231-0071 ACCORDING TO WITNESSES THE FALL UPON THIS SMALL AREA OCCUPIED TEN MINUTES I CANNOT THINK OF A CLEARER INDICATION OF A DIRECT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND
3240-131231-0072 THE FISH WERE ALL DEAD AND INDEED STIFF AND HARD WHEN PICKED UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OCCURRENCE BY ALL OF WHICH I MEAN THAT WE HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO PILE UP OUR DATA OF THINGS THAT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE OVERHEAD
3240-131231-0073 WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP THE SUBJECT FROM MANY APPROACHES BEFORE OUR ACCEPTANCE WHICH SEEMS QUITE AS RIGOROUSLY ARRIVED AT AS EVER HAS BEEN A BELIEF CAN EMERGE FROM THE ACCURSED I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE HORSE AND THE BARN WILL HELP US TO EMERGE
3240-131231-0074 BUT IF EVER ANYTHING DID GO UP FROM THIS EARTH'S SURFACE AND STAY UP THOSE DAMNED THINGS MAY HAVE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN A TORNADO IN WISCONSIN MAY TWENTY THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0075 A BARN AND A HORSE WERE CARRIED COMPLETELY AWAY AND NEITHER HORSE NOR BARN NOR ANY PORTION OF EITHER HAVE SINCE BEEN FOUND AFTER THAT WHICH WOULD BE A LITTLE STRONG WERE IT NOT FOR A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN OUR DIGESTIONS THAT I NOTE AS WE GO ALONG
3240-131231-0076 THERE IS LITTLE OF THE BIZARRE OR THE UNASSIMILABLE IN THE TURTLE THAT HOVERED SIX MONTHS OR SO OVER A SMALL TOWN IN MISSISSIPPI MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131231-0077 FELL A SMALL PIECE OF ALABASTER THAT AT BOVINA EIGHT MILES FROM VICKSBURG FELL A GOPHER TURTLE THEY FELL IN A HAILSTORM THIS ITEM WAS WIDELY COPIED AT THE TIME FOR INSTANCE NATURE
3240-131231-0078 AS TO DISCUSSION NOT A WORD OR SCIENCE AND ITS CONTINUITY WITH PRESBYTERIANISM DATA LIKE THIS ARE DAMNED AT BIRTH THE WEATHER REVIEW DOES SPRINKLE OR BAPTIZE OR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THIS INFANT
3240-131231-0079 BUT IN ALL THE METEOROLOGICAL LITERATURE THAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH AFTER THAT DATE NOT A WORD EXCEPT MENTION ONCE OR TWICE THE EDITOR OF THE REVIEW SAYS
3240-131231-0080 AN EXAMINATION OF THE WEATHER MAP SHOWS THAT THESE HAILSTORMS OCCUR ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF A REGION OF COLD NORTHERLY WINDS AND WERE BUT A SMALL PART OF A SERIES OF SIMILAR STORMS
3240-131231-0081 OF ALL INCREDIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM I GIVE FIRST PLACE TO A NOTION OF A WHIRLWIND POUNCING UPON A REGION
3240-131231-0082 THIS TIME THE OTHER MECHANICAL THING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE CANNOT RISE IN RESPONSE TO ITS STIMULUS IT IS RESISTED IN THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE COATED WITH ICE MONTH OF MAY IN A SOUTHERN STATE IF A WHIRLWIND AT ALL
3240-131231-0083 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED SELECTION THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE FALL OF OTHER OBJECTS BUT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT IN THE REVIEW TO SPECIFY A WHIRLWIND THESE STRANGELY ASSOCIATED THINGS WERE REMARKABLY SEPARATED THEY FELL EIGHT MILES APART
3240-131231-0084 THEN AS IF THERE WERE REAL REASONING THEY MUST HAVE BEEN HIGH TO FALL WITH SUCH DIVERGENCE OR ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED PARTLY HORIZONTALLY EIGHT MILES FARTHER THAN THE OTHER BUT EITHER SUPPOSITION ARGUES FOR POWER MORE THAN THAT OF A LOCAL WHIRL OR GUST
3240-131231-0085 OR ARGUES FOR A GREAT SPECIFIC DISTURBANCE OF WHICH THERE IS NO RECORD FOR THE MONTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131232-0000 THEN I THINK OF A HURRICANE THAT OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WEEKS OR MONTHS BEFORE MAY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR NO I DON'T LOOK FOR IT AND INEVITABLY FIND IT OR THAT THINGS CAN GO UP SO HIGH IN HURRICANES THAT THEY STAY UP INDEFINITELY
3240-131232-0001 BUT MAY AFTER A WHILE BE SHAKEN DOWN BY STORMS
3240-131232-0002 SO THEN THAT THE TURTLE AND THE PIECE OF ALABASTER MAY HAVE HAD FAR DIFFERENT ORIGINS FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS PERHAPS HAVE ENTERED A REGION OF SUSPENSION OVER THIS EARTH WAFTING NEAR EACH OTHER LONG DURATION
3240-131232-0003 FINAL PRECIPITATION BY ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WITH HAIL OR THAT HAILSTONES TOO WHEN LARGE ARE PHENOMENA OF SUSPENSION OF LONG DURATION THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE VERY LARGE ONES COULD BECOME SO GREAT ONLY IN FALLING FROM THE CLOUDS
3240-131232-0004 LONG DURATION OTHER INDICATIONS OF LONG DURATION I THINK OF A REGION SOMEWHERE ABOVE THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN WHICH GRAVITATION IS INOPERATIVE AND IS NOT GOVERNED BY THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE
3240-131232-0005 QUITE AS MAGNETISM IS NEGLIGIBLE AT A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FROM A MAGNET THEORETICALLY THE ATTRACTION OF A MAGNET SHOULD DECREASE WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BUT THE FALLING OFF IS FOUND TO BE ALMOST ABRUPT AT A SHORT DISTANCE
3240-131232-0006 HORSES AND BARNS AND ELEPHANTS AND FLIES AND DODOES MOAS AND PTERODACTYLS LEAVES FROM MODERN TREES AND LEAVES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS ERA ALL HOWEVER TENDING TO DISINTEGRATE INTO HOMOGENEOUS LOOKING MUDS OR DUSTS
3240-131232-0007 RED OR BLACK OR YELLOW TREASURE TROVES FOR THE PALAEONTOLOGISTS AND FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ACCUMULATIONS OF CENTURIES CYCLONES OF EGYPT GREECE AND ASSYRIA FISHES DRIED AND HARD THERE A SHORT TIME OTHERS THERE LONG ENOUGH TO PUTREFY
3240-131232-0008 BUT THE OMNIPRESENCE OF HETEROGENEITY OR LIVING FISHES ALSO PONDS OF FRESH WATER OCEANS OF SALT WATER AS TO THE LAW OF GRAVITATION I PREFER TO TAKE ONE SIMPLE STAND
3240-131232-0009 ORTHODOXY ACCEPTS THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES GRAVITATION IS ONE OF THESE FORCES ALL OTHER FORCES HAVE PHENOMENA OF REPULSION AND OF INERTNESS IRRESPECTIVE OF DISTANCE AS WELL AS OF ATTRACTION
3240-131232-0010 BUT NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION ADMITS ATTRACTION ONLY THEN NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION CAN BE ONLY ONE THIRD ACCEPTABLE EVEN TO THE ORTHODOX OR THERE IS DENIAL OF THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES OR STILL SIMPLER HERE ARE THE DATA
3240-131232-0011 THOUGH IT HARMONIZES WITH DATA OF FISHES THAT FALL AS IF FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND OF COURSE WITH OTHER DATA TOO IS INADEQUATE TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO PECULIARITIES OF THE FALLS OF FROGS THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF TADPOLES BEEN REPORTED
3240-131232-0012 THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF FULL GROWN FROGS BEEN REPORTED ALWAYS FROGS A FEW MONTHS OLD IT SOUNDS POSITIVE BUT IF THERE BE SUCH REPORTS THEY ARE SOMEWHERE OUT OF MY RANGE OF READING BUT TADPOLES WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SKY THAN WOULD FROGS
3240-131232-0013 LITTLE OR BIG IF SUCH FALLS BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHIRLWINDS AND MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA IF THOUGH VERY TENTATIVELY AND PROVISIONALLY WE ACCEPT THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA
3240-131232-0014 BEFORE WE TAKE UP AN ESPECIAL EXPRESSION UPON THE FALL OF IMMATURE AND LARVAL FORMS OF LIFE TO THIS EARTH AND THE NECESSITY THEN OF CONCEIVING OF SOME FACTOR BESIDES MERE STATIONARINESS OR SUSPENSION OR STAGNATION
3240-131232-0015 THERE ARE OTHER DATA THAT ARE SIMILAR TO DATA OF FALLS OF FISHES SCIENCE GOSSIP
3240-131232-0016 THAT SMALL SNAILS OF A LAND SPECIES HAD FALLEN NEAR REDRUTH CORNWALL JULY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX DURING A HEAVY THUNDERSTORM ROADS AND FIELDS STREWN WITH THEM SO THAT THEY WERE GATHERED UP BY THE HATFUL
3240-131232-0017 NONE SEEN TO FALL BY THE WRITER OF THIS ACCOUNT SNAILS SAID TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT TO ANY PREVIOUSLY KNOWN IN THIS DISTRICT
3240-131232-0018 OF GREAT AND DESERVED REPUTE I THOUGHT I SHOULD FOR ONCE LIKE TO TRACE THE ORIGIN OF ONE OF THESE FABULOUS TALES OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE IS THAT JUSTICE CANNOT BE IN AN INTERMEDIATE EXISTENCE
3240-131232-0019 IN WHICH THERE CAN BE APPROXIMATION ONLY TO JUSTICE OR TO INJUSTICE THAT TO BE FAIR IS TO HAVE NO OPINION AT ALL THAT TO BE HONEST IS TO BE UNINTERESTED THAT TO INVESTIGATE IS TO ADMIT PREJUDICE THAT NOBODY HAS EVER REALLY INVESTIGATED ANYTHING
3240-131232-0020 BUT HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT POSITIVELY TO PROVE OR TO DISPROVE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONCEIVED OF OR SUSPECTED IN ADVANCE AS I SUSPECTED SAYS THIS CORRESPONDENT I FOUND THAT THE SNAILS WERE OF A FAMILIAR LAND SPECIES THAT THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND
3240-131232-0021 IN THE FIRST PLACE HE FOUND THAT THE SNAILS HAD APPEARED AFTER THE RAIN THAT ASTONISHED RUSTICS HAD JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY HAD FALLEN HE MET ONE PERSON WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN THE SNAILS FALL THIS WAS HIS ERROR SAYS THE INVESTIGATOR
3240-131232-0022 IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT THEY WERE SHOVELED UP IT IS SAID THAT THE SNAILS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A LOCAL SPECIES
3240-131232-0023 AND THAT IN HIS OPINION THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME UNUSUAL CONDITION ALOFT COMES OUT IN HIS OBSERVATION UPON THE CURIOUS AZURE BLUE APPEARANCE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME
3240-131232-0024 THAT ACCORDING TO DAS WETTER DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO UPON AUGUST NINTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A YELLOW CLOUD APPEARED OVER PADERBORN GERMANY FROM THIS CLOUD FELL A TORRENTIAL RAIN IN WHICH WERE HUNDREDS OF MUSSELS
3240-131232-0025 THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE NOR OF A WHIRLWIND LIZARDS
3240-131232-0026 THAT DURING A HEAVY SHOWER JULY THIRD EIGHTEEN SIXTY HE HEARD A PECULIAR SOUND AT HIS FEET AND LOOKING DOWN SAW A SNAKE LYING AS IF STUNNED BY A FALL IT THEN CAME TO LIFE GRAY SNAKE ABOUT A FOOT LONG
3240-131232-0027 THESE DATA HAVE ANY MEANING OR LACK OF MEANING OR DEGREE OF DAMNATION YOU PLEASE BUT IN THE MATTER OF THE FALL THAT OCCURRED AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE OCCUR SOME STRONG SIGNIFICANCES
3240-131232-0028 OUR QUASI REASONING UPON THIS SUBJECT APPLIES TO ALL SEGREGATIONS SO FAR CONSIDERED MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT
3240-131232-0029 RATHER STRICTLY LOCALIZED OR IN A SPACE OF TWO BLOCKS AND AFTER A VIOLENT STORM IN WHICH THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS SNAKES WERE FOUND THEY WERE CRAWLING ON SIDEWALKS IN YARDS AND IN STREETS AND IN MASSES
3240-131232-0030 BUT NONE WERE FOUND ON ROOFS OR ANY OTHER ELEVATION ABOVE GROUND AND NONE WERE SEEN TO FALL IF YOU PREFER TO BELIEVE THAT THE SNAKES HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE OR HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THAT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO CALL SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEM
3240-131232-0031 IN THE STREETS OF MEMPHIS JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHY THAT'S SENSIBLE THAT'S THE COMMON SENSE THAT HAS BEEN AGAINST US FROM THE FIRST IT IS NOT SAID WHETHER THE SNAKES WERE OF A KNOWN SPECIES OR NOT
3240-131232-0032 AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE STREETS CRAWLING LOOSE OR IN THICK TANGLED MASSES IN THE FIRST PLACE IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT THESE SNAKES HAD BEEN RAISED FROM SOME OTHER PART OF THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN A WHIRLWIND IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT A WHIRLWIND COULD SEGREGATE THEM
3240-131232-0033 STONES FENCE RAILS LIMBS OF TREES SAY THAT THE SNAKES OCCUPIED THE NEXT GRADATION AND WOULD BE THE NEXT TO FALL
3240-131232-0034 AGAIN OURS IS THE OBJECTION AGAINST SUCH SELECTIVENESS BY A WHIRLWIND CONCEIVABLY A WHIRLWIND COULD SCOOP OUT A DEN OF HIBERNATING SNAKES WITH STONES AND EARTH AND AN INFINITUDE OF OTHER DEBRIS SNATCHING UP DOZENS OF SNAKES
3240-131232-0035 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TO A DEN HUNDREDS MAYBE BUT ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THIS OCCURRENCE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM ALIVE FROM ONE FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN LENGTH
3240-131232-0036 RECORDS THE FALL AND SAYS THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM THE USUAL WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION IS GIVEN BUT IN WHAT LOCALITY SNAKES EXIST IN SUCH ABUNDANCE IS YET A MYSTERY THIS MATTER OF ENORMOUSNESS OF NUMBERS
3240-131232-0037 SUGGESTS TO ME SOMETHING OF A MIGRATORY NATURE BUT THAT SNAKES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT MIGRATE IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IF EVER AS TO FALLS OR FLUTTERINGS OF WINGED INSECTS FROM THE SKY PREVAILING NOTIONS OF SWARMING WOULD SEEM EXPLANATORY ENOUGH
3240-131232-0038 FALL OF FISHES JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN HOLLAND ANTS AUGUST FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE STRASBOURG LITTLE TOADS AUGUST SECOND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE SAVOY
3240-131232-0039 FALL OF ANTS CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR SOME WERE WINGLESS
3240-131232-0040 ENORMOUS FALL OF ANTS NANCY FRANCE JULY TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MOST OF THEM WERE WINGLESS
328-129766-0000 AND SO MIGHT MARRY AGAIN WHEN HE WOULD
328-129766-0001 AND TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT ME AS LONG AS I LIVED AND THAT IF HE DIED BEFORE ME HE WOULD LEAVE SUFFICIENT TO HIS MOTHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME STILL IN THE NAME OF A SISTER AND HE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS CAREFUL OF ME WHEN HE HEARD OF ME
328-129766-0002 AS YOU SHALL HEAR IN ITS TIME I CAME AWAY FOR ENGLAND IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST AFTER I HAD BEEN EIGHT YEARS IN THAT COUNTRY AND NOW A NEW SCENE OF MISFORTUNES ATTENDED ME WHICH PERHAPS FEW WOMEN HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LIFE OF
328-129766-0003 WE HAD AN INDIFFERENT GOOD VOYAGE TILL WE CAME JUST UPON THE COAST OF ENGLAND AND WHERE WE ARRIVED IN TWO AND THIRTY DAYS BUT WERE THEN RUFFLED WITH TWO OR THREE STORMS
328-129766-0004 GOT SOME REFRESHMENT ON SHORE AND PUT TO SEA AGAIN THOUGH WE MET WITH VERY BAD WEATHER AGAIN IN WHICH THE SHIP SPRUNG HER MAINMAST AS THEY CALLED IT FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT THEY MEANT BUT WE GOT AT LAST INTO MILFORD HAVEN IN WALES
328-129766-0005 WHERE THOUGH IT WAS REMOTE FROM OUR PORT
328-129766-0006 THE ISLE OF BRITAIN I RESOLVED TO VENTURE IT NO MORE UPON THE WATERS WHICH HAD BEEN SO TERRIBLE TO ME SO GETTING MY CLOTHES AND MONEY ON SHORE WITH MY BILLS OF LOADING AND OTHER PAPERS I RESOLVED TO COME FOR LONDON
328-129766-0007 THE PORT WHITHER SHE WAS BOUND WAS TO BRISTOL WHERE MY BROTHER'S CHIEF CORRESPONDENT LIVED I GOT TO LONDON IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS WHERE I HEARD A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THAT THE SHIP WAS ARRIVED IN BRISTOL
328-129766-0008 THE BREAKING OF HER MAINMAST SHE HAD GREAT DAMAGE ON BOARD AND THAT A GREAT PART OF HER CARGO WAS SPOILED I HAD NOW A NEW SCENE OF LIFE UPON MY HANDS AND A DREADFUL APPEARANCE IT HAD I WAS COME AWAY WITH A KIND OF FINAL FAREWELL
328-129766-0009 WHAT I BROUGHT WITH ME WAS INDEED CONSIDERABLE HAD IT COME SAFE AND BY THE HELP OF IT I MIGHT HAVE MARRIED AGAIN TOLERABLY WELL BUT AS IT WAS I WAS REDUCED TO BETWEEN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN THE WHOLE AND THIS WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF RECRUIT
328-129766-0010 I WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT FRIENDS NAY EVEN SO MUCH AS WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCE
328-129766-0011 THAT SET ME UP FORMERLY FOR A FORTUNE SHE WAS DEAD AND HER HUSBAND ALSO AS I WAS INFORMED UPON SENDING A PERSON UNKNOWN TO INQUIRE THE LOOKING AFTER MY CARGO OF GOODS SOON AFTER OBLIGED ME TO TAKE A JOURNEY TO BRISTOL AND DURING MY ATTENDANCE UPON THAT AFFAIR
328-129766-0012 I TOOK THE DIVERSION OF GOING TO THE BATH FOR AS I WAS STILL FAR FROM BEING OLD SO MY HUMOUR WHICH WAS ALWAYS GAY CONTINUED SO TO AN EXTREME AND BEING NOW AS IT WERE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE THOUGH I WAS A WOMAN WITHOUT A FORTUNE
328-129766-0013 AS HAD BEEN MY CASE BEFORE THE BATH IS A PLACE OF GALLANTRY ENOUGH EXPENSIVE AND FULL OF SNARES I WENT THITHER INDEED
328-129766-0014 BUT I MUST DO MYSELF JUSTICE AS TO PROTEST I KNEW NOTHING AMISS I MEANT NOTHING BUT IN AN HONEST WAY NOR HAD I ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT ME AT FIRST THAT LOOKED THE WAY WHICH AFTERWARDS I SUFFERED THEM TO BE GUIDED
328-129766-0015 AS IT IS CALLED THERE AND CONTRACTED SOME UNHAPPY ACQUAINTANCES WHICH RATHER PROMPTED THE FOLLIES I FELL AFTERWARDS INTO THAN FORTIFIED ME AGAINST THEM I LIVED PLEASANTLY ENOUGH KEPT GOOD COMPANY THAT IS TO SAY GAY FINE COMPANY
328-129766-0016 BUT HAD THE DISCOURAGEMENT TO FIND THIS WAY OF LIVING SUNK ME EXCEEDINGLY AND THAT AS I HAD NO SETTLED INCOME SO SPENDING UPON THE MAIN STOCK WAS BUT A CERTAIN KIND OF BLEEDING TO DEATH AND THIS GAVE ME MANY SAD REFLECTIONS IN THE INTERVAL OF MY OTHER THOUGHTS
328-129766-0017 HOWEVER I SHOOK THEM OFF
328-129766-0018 BUT I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR IT I WAS NOT NOW AT REDRIFF WHERE IF I HAD SET MYSELF TOLERABLY UP SOME HONEST SEA CAPTAIN OR OTHER MIGHT HAVE TALKED WITH ME UPON THE HONOURABLE TERMS OF MATRIMONY BUT I WAS AT THE BATH
328-129766-0019 WHERE MEN FIND A MISTRESS SOMETIMES BUT VERY RARELY LOOK FOR A WIFE AND CONSEQUENTLY ALL THE PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCES A WOMAN CAN EXPECT TO MAKE THERE MUST HAVE SOME TENDENCY THAT WAY I HAD SPENT THE FIRST SEASON WELL ENOUGH
328-129766-0020 FOR THOUGH I HAD CONTRACTED SOME ACQUAINTANCE WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO CAME TO THE BATH FOR HIS DIVERSION
328-129766-0021 AS IT MIGHT BE CALLED I HAD RESISTED SOME CASUAL OFFERS OF GALLANTRY AND HAD MANAGED THAT WAY WELL ENOUGH I WAS NOT WICKED ENOUGH TO COME INTO THE CRIME FOR THE MERE VICE OF IT AND I HAD NO EXTRAORDINARY OFFERS MADE ME THAT TEMPTED ME WITH THE MAIN THING WHICH I WANTED
328-129766-0022 I CONTRACTED AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED WHO THOUGH SHE DID NOT KEEP AN ILL HOUSE AS WE CALL IT YET HAD NONE OF THE BEST PRINCIPLES IN HERSELF I HAD ON ALL OCCASIONS BEHAVED MYSELF SO WELL
328-129766-0023 AS NOT TO GET THE LEAST SLUR UPON MY REPUTATION ON ANY ACCOUNT WHATEVER AND ALL THE MEN THAT I HAD CONVERSED WITH WERE OF SO GOOD REPUTATION THAT I HAD NOT GIVEN THE LEAST REFLECTION BY CONVERSING WITH THEM
328-129766-0024 FOR A WICKED CORRESPONDENCE IF THEY HAD ANY OF THEM OFFERED IT YET THERE WAS ONE GENTLEMAN AS ABOVE WHO ALWAYS SINGLED ME OUT FOR THE DIVERSION OF MY COMPANY AS HE CALLED IT WHICH AS HE WAS PLEASED TO SAY WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HIM BUT AT THAT TIME
328-129766-0025 THERE WAS NO MORE IN IT I HAD MANY MELANCHOLY HOURS AT THE BATH AFTER THE COMPANY WAS GONE
328-129766-0026 AND FOR RECRUITS OF MONEY YET I CHOSE TO COME BACK TO BATH FOR MY RESIDENCE BECAUSE BEING ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED IN THE SUMMER I FOUND THAT DURING THE WINTER I LIVED RATHER CHEAPER THERE
328-129766-0027 HERE I SAY I PASSED THE WINTER AS HEAVILY AS I HAD PASSED THE AUTUMN CHEERFULLY
328-129766-0028 OF WHAT LAY HARDEST UPON MY MIND AND PARTICULARLY THE NARROWNESS OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE LOSS OF MY FORTUNE BY THE DAMAGE OF MY GOODS AT SEA I TOLD HER ALSO THAT I HAD A MOTHER AND A BROTHER IN VIRGINIA IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0029 AND AS I HAD REALLY WRITTEN BACK TO MY MOTHER IN PARTICULAR TO REPRESENT MY CONDITION AND THE GREAT LOSS I HAD RECEIVED
328-129766-0030 SO I DID NOT FAIL TO LET MY NEW FRIEND KNOW THAT I EXPECTED A SUPPLY FROM THENCE AND SO INDEED I DID AND AS THE SHIPS WENT FROM BRISTOL TO YORK RIVER IN VIRGINIA AND BACK AGAIN GENERALLY IN LESS TIME FROM LONDON
328-129766-0031 AND THAT MY BROTHER CORRESPONDED CHIEFLY AT BRISTOL I THOUGHT IT WAS MUCH BETTER FOR ME TO WAIT HERE FOR MY RETURNS THAN TO GO TO LONDON WHERE ALSO I HAD NOT THE LEAST ACQUAINTANCE MY NEW FRIEND APPEARED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH MY CONDITION
328-129766-0032 AND INDEED WAS SO VERY KIND AS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF MY LIVING WITH HER TO SO LOW A PRICE DURING THE WINTER THAT SHE CONVINCED ME SHE GOT NOTHING BY ME AND AS FOR LODGING DURING THE WINTER I PAID NOTHING AT ALL
328-129766-0033 TILL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO DO OTHERWISE SHE HAD SOME PERSONS OF CHARACTER THAT FREQUENTLY LODGED IN HER HOUSE AND IN PARTICULAR THE GENTLEMAN WHO AS I SAID SINGLED ME OUT FOR HIS COMPANION
328-129766-0034 THE WINTER BEFORE AND HE CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN HIS COMPANY AND TWO SERVANTS AND LODGED IN THE SAME HOUSE
328-129766-0035 LETTING HIM KNOW THAT I WAS STILL WITH HER BUT SHE DENIED IT AND PROTESTED TO ME THAT SHE DID NOT AND HE SAID THE SAME IN A WORD THIS GENTLEMAN CAME DOWN AND CONTINUED TO SINGLE ME OUT FOR HIS PECULIAR CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS CONVERSATION
328-129766-0036 IF I MIGHT BELIEVE HIM WAS TO HIM
328-129766-0037 AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
328-129766-0038 AND THAT I WAITED AT BATH TILL THE NEXT VIRGINIA FLEET SHOULD ARRIVE BY WHICH I EXPECTED CONSIDERABLE EFFECTS I UNDERSTOOD BY HIM AND BY OTHERS OF HIM THAT HE HAD A WIFE BUT THAT THE LADY WAS DISTEMPERED IN HER HEAD AND WAS UNDER THE CONDUCT
328-129766-0039 OF HER OWN RELATIONS WHICH HE CONSENTED TO TO AVOID ANY REFLECTIONS THAT MIGHT AS WAS NOT UNUSUAL IN SUCH CASES BE CAST ON HIM FOR MISMANAGING HER CURE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE CAME TO THE BATH TO DIVERT HIS THOUGHTS
328-129766-0040 FROM THE DISTURBANCE OF SUCH A MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE AS THAT WAS MY LANDLADY WHO OF HER OWN ACCORD ENCOURAGED THE CORRESPONDENCE ON ALL OCCASIONS GAVE ME AN ADVANTAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HIM
328-129766-0041 AS A MAN OF HONOUR AND OF VIRTUE AS WELL AS OF GREAT ESTATE AND INDEED I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF REASON TO SAY SO OF HIM TOO FOR THOUGH WE LODGED BOTH ON A FLOOR AND HE HAD FREQUENTLY COME INTO MY CHAMBER EVEN WHEN I WAS IN BED
328-129766-0042 AND I ALSO INTO HIS WHEN HE WAS IN BED YET HE NEVER OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME FURTHER THAN A KISS OR SO MUCH AS SOLICITED ME TO ANYTHING TILL LONG AFTER AS YOU SHALL HEAR
328-129766-0043 AND SHE AGAIN USED TO TELL ME SHE BELIEVED IT WAS SO FROM THE BEGINNING HOWEVER SHE USED TO TELL ME THAT SHE THOUGHT I OUGHT TO EXPECT SOME GRATIFICATION FROM HIM FOR MY COMPANY FOR INDEED HE DID AS IT WERE ENGROSS ME AND I WAS SELDOM FROM HIM
328-129766-0044 I TOLD HER I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM THE LEAST OCCASION TO THINK I WANTED IT
328-129766-0045 AND SHE DID SO AND MANAGED IT SO DEXTEROUSLY
328-129766-0046 AND SO I PUT OFF ALL ROOM FOR ANY OFFER FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ATTACKED ME AGAIN
328-129766-0047 WHICH HE WAS SORRY FOR ASSURING ME THAT HE INQUIRED INTO IT WITH NO DESIGN TO SATISFY HIS OWN CURIOSITY BUT MERELY TO ASSIST ME IF THERE WAS ANY OCCASION BUT SINCE I
328-129766-0048 IN NEED OF ANY ASSISTANCE HE HAD BUT ONE THING MORE TO DESIRE OF ME AND THAT WAS THAT I WOULD PROMISE HIM THAT WHEN I WAS ANY WAY STRAITENED OR LIKE TO BE SO I WOULD FRANKLY TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I WOULD MAKE USE OF HIM WITH THE SAME FREEDOM THAT HE MADE THE OFFER
328-129766-0049 ADDING THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS FIND I HAD A TRUE FRIEND THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS AFRAID TO TRUST HIM I OMITTED NOTHING THAT WAS FIT TO BE SAID BY ONE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I HAD A DUE SENSE OF HIS KINDNESS
328-129766-0050 AND INDEED FROM THAT TIME I DID NOT APPEAR SO MUCH RESERVED TO HIM AS I HAD DONE BEFORE THOUGH STILL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF THE STRICTEST VIRTUE ON BOTH SIDES BUT HOW FREE SOEVER OUR CONVERSATION WAS I COULD NOT ARRIVE TO THAT SORT OF FREEDOM
328-129766-0051 THOUGH I WAS SECRETLY VERY GLAD OF HIS OFFER SOME WEEKS PASSED AFTER THIS AND STILL I NEVER ASKED HIM FOR MONEY WHEN MY LANDLADY A CUNNING CREATURE WHO HAD OFTEN PRESSED ME TO IT BUT FOUND THAT I COULD NOT DO IT
328-129766-0052 MAKES A STORY OF HER OWN INVENTING AND COMES IN
328-129766-0053 OH WIDOW SAYS SHE I HAVE BAD NEWS TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING WHAT IS THAT SAID I ARE THE VIRGINIA SHIPS TAKEN BY THE FRENCH FOR THAT WAS MY FEAR NO NO SAYS SHE
328-129766-0054 BUT THE MAN YOU SENT TO BRISTOL YESTERDAY FOR MONEY IS COME BACK AND SAYS HE HAS BROUGHT NONE NOW I COULD BY NO MEANS LIKE HER PROJECT
328-129766-0055 WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT WANT AND I CLEARLY SAW THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY BEING BACKWARD TO ASK SO I TOOK HER UP SHORT
328-129766-0056 SAID I FOR I ASSURE YOU HE BROUGHT ME ALL THE MONEY I SENT HIM FOR AND HERE IT IS SAID I PULLING OUT MY PURSE WITH ABOUT TWELVE GUINEAS IN IT AND ADDED I INTEND YOU SHALL HAVE MOST OF IT BY AND BY HE SEEMED DISTASTED A LITTLE AT HER TALKING
328-129766-0057 AS SHE DID AT FIRST AS WELL AS I TAKING IT AS I FANCIED HE WOULD AS SOMETHING FORWARD OF HER BUT WHEN HE SAW ME GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER HE CAME IMMEDIATELY TO HIMSELF AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING WE TALKED OF IT AGAIN WHEN I FOUND HE WAS FULLY SATISFIED
328-129766-0058 AND SMILING SAID HE HOPED I WOULD NOT WANT MONEY AND NOT TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I HAD PROMISED HIM OTHERWISE I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED AT MY LANDLADY'S TALKING SO PUBLICLY THE DAY BEFORE OF WHAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
328-129766-0059 BUT I SUPPOSED SHE WANTED WHAT I OWED HER WHICH WAS ABOUT EIGHT GUINEAS WHICH I HAD RESOLVED TO GIVE HER AND HAD ACCORDINGLY
328-129766-0060 HE WAS IN A MIGHT GOOD HUMOUR WHEN HE HEARD ME SAY I HAD PAID HER AND IT WENT OFF INTO SOME OTHER DISCOURSE AT THAT TIME BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE HAVING HEARD ME UP ABOUT MY ROOM BEFORE HIM HE CALLED TO ME AND I ANSWERING HE ASKED ME TO COME INTO HIS CHAMBER
328-129766-0061 FOR HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME WHICH WAS OF SOME MOMENT AFTER SOME VERY KIND EXPRESSIONS HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE VERY HONEST TO HIM AND GIVE A SINCERE ANSWER TO ONE THING HE WOULD DESIRE OF ME
328-129766-0062 AT THE WORD SINCERE AND ASKING HIM IF I HAD EVER GIVEN HIM ANY ANSWERS WHICH WERE NOT SINCERE I PROMISED HIM I WOULD WHY THEN HIS REQUEST WAS HE SAID TO LET HIM SEE MY PURSE
328-129766-0063 I IMMEDIATELY PUT MY HAND INTO MY POCKET AND LAUGHING TO HIM PULLED IT OUT AND THERE WAS IN IT THREE GUINEAS AND A HALF
328-129766-0064 NOT BY A GREAT DEAL WELL THEN HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE ME PROMISE TO GO AND FETCH HIM ALL THE MONEY I HAD EVERY FARTHING I TOLD HIM I WOULD AND I WENT INTO MY CHAMBER AND FETCHED HIM A LITTLE PRIVATE DRAWER
328-129766-0065 WHERE I HAD ABOUT SIX GUINEAS MORE AND SOME SILVER AND THREW IT ALL DOWN UPON THE BED AND TOLD HIM THERE WAS ALL MY WEALTH HONESTLY TO A SHILLING HE LOOKED A LITTLE AT IT BUT DID NOT TELL IT
328-129766-0066 AND THEN REACHING HIS POCKET PULLED OUT A KEY AND BADE ME OPEN A LITTLE WALNUT TREE BOX HE HAD UPON THE TABLE AND BRING HIM SUCH A DRAWER WHICH I DID IN WHICH DRAWER THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN GOLD I BELIEVE NEAR TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
328-129766-0067 BUT I KNEW NOT HOW MUCH HE TOOK THE DRAWER AND TAKING MY HAND MADE ME PUT IT IN AND TAKE A WHOLE HANDFUL I WAS BACKWARD AT THAT BUT HE HELD MY HAND HARD IN HIS HAND
328-129766-0068 WHEN I HAD DONE SO HE MADE ME PUT THEM INTO MY LAP AND TOOK MY LITTLE DRAWER
328-129766-0069 AND CARRY IT ALL HOME INTO MY OWN CHAMBER I RELATE THIS STORY THE MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE GOOD HUMOUR THERE WAS IN IT AND TO SHOW THE TEMPER WITH WHICH WE CONVERSED
328-129766-0070 AND IN A WORD PRESSED ME TO BUY BETTER
328-129766-0071 FOR I LOVED NOTHING IN THE WORLD BETTER THAN FINE CLOTHES I TOLD HIM I MUST HOUSEWIFE THE MONEY HE HAD LENT ME OR ELSE I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY HIM AGAIN HE THEN TOLD ME IN A FEW WORDS THAT AS HE HAD A SINCERE RESPECT FOR ME AND KNEW MY CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0072 AND THAT HE THOUGHT I HAD MERITED IT FROM HIM BY GIVING HIM MY COMPANY SO ENTIRELY AS I HAD DONE AFTER THIS HE MADE ME TAKE A MAID AND KEEP HOUSE
328-129766-0073 WHICH I DID VERY WILLINGLY BELIEVING AS IT APPEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY IT NOR DID THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE FAIL TO FIND HER ACCOUNT IN IT TOO WE HAD LIVED THUS NEAR THREE MONTHS WHEN
328-129766-0074 THE COMPANY BEGINNING TO WEAR AWAY AT THE BATH HE TALKED OF GOING AWAY
328-129766-0075 I WAS NOT VERY EASY IN THAT PROPOSAL NOT KNOWING WHAT POSTURE I WAS TO LIVE IN THERE OR HOW HE MIGHT USE ME BUT WHILE THIS WAS IN DEBATE
328-129766-0076 CALLED SHEPTON WHERE HE HAD SOME BUSINESS AND WAS THERE TAKEN VERY ILL AND SO ILL THAT HE COULD NOT TRAVEL SO HE SENT HIS MAN BACK TO BATH TO BEG ME THAT I WOULD HIRE A COACH AND COME OVER TO HIM BEFORE HE WENT
328-129766-0077 HE HAD LEFT ALL HIS MONEY AND OTHER THINGS OF VALUE WITH ME AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM I DID NOT KNOW BUT I SECURED THEM AS WELL AS I COULD AND LOCKED UP THE LODGINGS AND WENT TO HIM WHERE I FOUND HIM VERY ILL INDEED HOWEVER I PERSUADED HIM TO BE CARRIED
328-129766-0078 IN A LITTER TO THE BATH WHERE THERE WAS MORE HELP AND BETTER ADVICE TO BE HAD HE CONSENTED AND I BROUGHT HIM TO THE BATH WHICH WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES AS I REMEMBER HERE HE CONTINUED VERY ILL OF A FEVER
328-129766-0079 AND KEPT HIS BED FIVE WEEKS ALL WHICH TIME I NURSED HIM AND TENDED HIM MYSELF
328-129766-0080 INDEED IF I HAD BEEN HIS WIFE I COULD NOT HAVE DONE MORE I SAT UP WITH HIM SO MUCH AND SO OFTEN THAT AT LAST INDEED HE WOULD NOT LET ME SIT UP ANY LONGER AND THEN I GOT A PALLET BED INTO HIS ROOM AND LAY IN IT JUST AT HIS BED'S FEET
328-129766-0081 I WAS INDEED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH HIS CONDITION AND WITH THE APPREHENSION OF LOSING SUCH A FRIEND AS HE WAS AND WAS LIKE TO BE TO ME AND I USED TO SIT AND CRY BY HIM MANY HOURS TOGETHER
328-129766-0082 HOWEVER AT LAST HE GREW BETTER AND GAVE HOPES THAT HE WOULD RECOVER AS INDEED HE DID THOUGH VERY SLOWLY WERE IT OTHERWISE THAN WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY I SHOULD NOT BE BACKWARD TO DISCLOSE IT
328-129766-0083 AS IT IS APPARENT I HAVE DONE IN OTHER CASES IN THIS ACCOUNT BUT I AFFIRM THAT THROUGH ALL THIS CONVERSATION ABATING THE FREEDOM OF COMING INTO THE CHAMBER WHEN I OR HE WAS IN BED AND ABATING THE NECESSARY OFFICES
328-129766-0084 OF ATTENDING HIM NIGHT AND DAY WHEN HE WAS SICK THERE HAD NOT PASSED THE LEAST IMMODEST WORD OR ACTION BETWEEN US OH THAT IT HAD BEEN SO TO THE LAST AFTER SOME TIME HE GATHERED STRENGTH AND GREW WELL APACE
328-129766-0085 AND I WOULD HAVE REMOVED MY PALLET BED BUT HE WOULD NOT LET ME TILL HE WAS ABLE TO VENTURE HIMSELF WITHOUT ANYBODY TO SIT UP WITH HIM AND THEN I REMOVED TO MY OWN CHAMBER
328-129766-0086 AND WHEN HE GREW QUITE WELL HE MADE ME A PRESENT OF FIFTY GUINEAS FOR MY CARE AND AS HE CALLED IT FOR HAZARDING MY LIFE TO SAVE HIS AND NOW HE MADE DEEP PROTESTATIONS OF A SINCERE INVIOLABLE AFFECTION FOR ME
328-129766-0087 BUT ALL ALONG ATTESTED IT TO BE WITH THE UTMOST RESERVE FOR MY VIRTUE AND HIS OWN I TOLD HIM I WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF IT HE CARRIED IT THAT LENGTH THAT HE PROTESTED TO ME THAT IF HE WAS NAKED IN BED WITH ME
328-129766-0088 AS HE WOULD DEFEND IT IF I WAS ASSAULTED BY A RAVISHER I BELIEVED HIM AND TOLD HIM I DID SO BUT THIS DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WOULD HE SAID
328-129766-0089 WAS A GREAT WHILE AFTER THIS THAT I HAD OCCASION ON MY OWN BUSINESS TO GO TO BRISTOL UPON WHICH HE HIRED ME A COACH AND WOULD GO WITH ME AND DID SO AND NOW INDEED OUR INTIMACY INCREASED
328-129766-0090 TO HAVE NO LODGING IN THE INN BUT IN ONE LARGE CHAMBER WITH TWO BEDS IN IT
328-129766-0091 AND COMING INTO THAT ROOM SAID VERY FRANKLY TO HIM SIR IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE LADY BE YOUR SPOUSE OR NO
328-129766-0092 WHICH DREW QUITE ACROSS THE ROOM AND EFFECTUALLY DIVIDED THE BEDS WELL SAYS MY FRIEND VERY READILY THESE BEDS WILL DO AND AS FOR THE REST WE ARE TOO NEAR AKIN TO LIE TOGETHER THOUGH WE MAY LODGE NEAR ONE ANOTHER
328-129766-0093 HE DECENTLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TILL I WAS IN BED AND THEN WENT TO BED IN THE BED ON HIS OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT LAY THERE TALKING TO ME A GREAT WHILE AT LAST REPEATING HIS USUAL SAYING THAT HE COULD LIE NAKED IN THE BED WITH ME AND NOT OFFER ME THE LEAST INJURY
328-129766-0094 HE STARTS OUT OF HIS BED AND NOW MY DEAR SAYS HE YOU SHALL SEE HOW JUST I WILL BE TO YOU AND THAT I CAN KEEP MY WORD AND AWAY HE COMES TO MY BED I RESISTED A LITTLE BUT I MUST CONFESS I SHOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED HIM MUCH
328-129766-0095 IF HE HAD NOT MADE THOSE PROMISES AT ALL SO AFTER A LITTLE STRUGGLE AS I SAID I LAY STILL AND LET HIM COME TO BED WHEN HE WAS THERE HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND SO I LAY ALL NIGHT WITH HIM BUT HE HAD NO MORE TO DO WITH ME OR OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME
328-129766-0096 OTHER THAN EMBRACING ME AS I SAY IN HIS ARMS NO NOT THE WHOLE NIGHT BUT ROSE UP AND DRESSED HIM IN THE MORNING AND LEFT ME AS INNOCENT FOR HIM AS I WAS THE DAY I WAS BORN THIS WAS A SURPRISING THING TO ME
328-129766-0097 AND PERHAPS MAY BE SO TO OTHERS WHO KNOW HOW THE LAWS OF NATURE WORK FOR HE WAS A STRONG VIGOROUS BRISK PERSON NOR DID HE ACT THUS ON A PRINCIPLE OF RELIGION AT ALL BUT OF MERE AFFECTION INSISTING ON IT
328-129766-0098 THAT THOUGH I WAS TO HIM TO MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN IN THE WORLD YET BECAUSE HE LOVED ME HE COULD NOT INJURE ME
332-128985-0000 WE WILL PASS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REGULAR OUT AND OUT PIRATE ONE FROM WHOSE MAST HEAD WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE BLACK FLAG WITH ITS SKULL AND CROSS BONES IF THAT EMBLEMATIC PIECE OF BUNTING HAD BEEN IN USE BY THE PIRATES OF THE PERIOD
332-128985-0001 AND HIS OWN WAS UNKNOWN AND THE BRAZILIAN BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN BRAZIL THOUGH OF DUTCH PARENTS UNLIKE MOST OF HIS FELLOW PRACTITIONERS HE DID NOT GRADUALLY BECOME A PIRATE FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH
332-128985-0002 HE NEVER HAD AN INTENTION OF BEING ANYTHING ELSE AS SOON AS HE GREW TO BE A MAN HE BECAME A BLOODY BUCCANEER AND AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY HE JOINED A PIRATE CREW AND HAD MADE BUT A FEW VOYAGES WHEN IT WAS PERCEIVED BY HIS COMPANIONS
332-128985-0003 THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGES
332-128985-0004 HE FELL IN WITH A SPANISH SHIP LOADED WITH SILVER BULLION HAVING CAPTURED THIS HE SAILED WITH HIS PRIZE TO JAMAICA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GREAT RESORTS OF THE ENGLISH BUCCANEERS THERE HIS SUCCESS DELIGHTED THE COMMUNITY
332-128985-0005 HIS TALENTS FOR THE CONDUCT OF GREAT PIRATICAL OPERATIONS SOON BECAME APPARENT AND HE WAS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE HEAD PIRATE OF THE WEST INDIES HE WAS NOW LOOKED UPON AS A HERO EVEN BY THOSE COLONISTS
332-128985-0006 WHO HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH PIRATES AND AS FOR ESQUEMELING HE SIMPLY WORSHIPPED THE GREAT BRAZILIAN DESPERADO IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT JULIUS CAESAR OR MISTER GLADSTONE
332-128985-0007 HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC IN HIS PRAISES AND AS IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS THE ROC IS DESCRIBED AS THE GREATEST OF BIRDS SO IN THE EYES OF THE BUCCANEER BIOGRAPHER THIS ROC WAS THE GREATEST OF PIRATES
332-128985-0008 THAT ROC NOW BECAME FAMOUS THE BETTER HE BECAME KNOWN THE MORE GENERAL WAS THE FEAR AND RESPECT FELT FOR HIM AND WE ARE TOLD THAT THE MOTHERS OF THE ISLANDS USED TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN TO SLEEP BY THREATENING THEM WITH THE TERRIBLE ROC IF THEY DID NOT CLOSE THEIR EYES
332-128985-0009 THIS STORY HOWEVER I REGARD WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DOUBT
332-128985-0010 BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS AN EASY THING TO FRIGHTEN A CHILD INTO GOING TO SLEEP IF I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A YOUNGSTER TAKE A NAP I SHOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN CUBA OR OF THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE ARMENIANS
332-128985-0011 THIS RENOWNED PIRATE FROM BRAZIL MUST HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE FELLOW TO LOOK AT HE WAS STRONG AND BRAWNY HIS FACE WAS SHORT AND VERY WIDE WITH HIGH CHEEK BONES AND HIS EXPRESSION PROBABLY RESEMBLED THAT OF A PUG DOG
332-128985-0012 HIS EYEBROWS WERE ENORMOUSLY LARGE AND BUSHY AND FROM UNDER THEM HE GLARED AT HIS MUNDANE SURROUNDINGS HE WAS NOT A MAN WHOSE SPIRIT COULD BE QUELLED BY LOOKING HIM STEADFASTLY IN THE EYE IT WAS HIS CUSTOM IN THE DAYTIME TO WALK ABOUT
332-128985-0013 CARRYING A DRAWN CUTLASS RESTING EASILY UPON HIS ARM EDGE UP VERY MUCH AS A FINE GENTLEMAN CARRIES HIS HIGH SILK HAT AND ANY ONE WHO SHOULD IMPERTINENTLY STARE OR ENDEAVOR TO QUELL HIS HIGH SPIRITS IN ANY OTHER WAY
332-128985-0014 WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
332-128985-0015 BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO STRICT AND EXACTING DURING THE BUSINESS SESSIONS OF HIS PIRATICAL YEAR BY WHICH I MEAN WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND AFTER PRIZES HE WAS VERY MUCH MORE DISAGREEABLE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A VACATION
332-128985-0016 ON HIS RETURN TO JAMAICA AFTER ONE OF HIS EXPEDITIONS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GIVE HIMSELF SOME RELAXATION AFTER THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO ROC TO GET HIMSELF THOROUGHLY DRUNK
332-128985-0017 WITH HIS CUTLASS WAVING HIGH IN THE AIR HE WOULD RUSH OUT INTO THE STREET AND TAKE A WHACK AT EVERY ONE WHOM HE MET AS FAR AS WAS POSSIBLE THE CITIZENS ALLOWED HIM TO HAVE THE STREET TO HIMSELF AND IT WAS NOT AT ALL LIKELY
332-128985-0018 THAT HIS VISITS TO JAMAICA WERE LOOKED FORWARD TO WITH ANY EAGER ANTICIPATIONS ROC IT MAY BE SAID WAS NOT ONLY A BLOODY PIRATE BUT A BLOODED ONE HE WAS THOROUGHBRED
332-128985-0019 FROM THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSERT HIS INDIVIDUALITY HE HAD BEEN A PIRATE AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EVER REFORM HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING ELSE THERE WERE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CASE
332-128985-0020 IN HIS NATURE THERE WAS NO ALLOY NOR MODERATION NOR FORBEARANCE THE APPRECIATIVE ESQUEMELING WHO MIGHT BE CALLED THE BOSWELL OF THE BUCCANEERS COULD NEVER HAVE MET HIS HERO ROC
332-128985-0021 WHEN THAT BUSHY BEARDED PIRATE WAS RUNNING AMUCK IN THE STREETS BUT IF HE HAD IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HE ASSURES US THAT WHEN ROC WAS NOT DRUNK HE WAS ESTEEMED BUT AT THE SAME TIME FEARED
332-128985-0022 BUT THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF GAINING ESTEEM AND ROC'S METHOD CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED VERY WELL IN THE CASE OF HIS LITERARY ASSOCIATE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE HATRED OF THE SPANIARDS BY THE BUCCANEERS BEGAN VERY EARLY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WEST INDIES
332-128985-0023 BUT IN ALL THE INSTANCES OF FEROCIOUS ENMITY TOWARD THE SPANIARDS THERE HAS BEEN NOTHING TO EQUAL THE FEELINGS OF ROC THE BRAZILIAN UPON THAT SUBJECT HIS DISLIKE TO EVERYTHING SPANISH AROSE HE DECLARED
332-128985-0024 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO BAD FOR A SPANIARD THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE WAS TO WAGE BITTER WAR AGAINST SPANISH SHIPS AND SPANISH SETTLEMENTS HE SELDOM GAVE ANY QUARTER TO HIS PRISONERS
332-128985-0025 THEN THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO BUT TO GO ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS AND PUT OUT TO SEA IN SEARCH OF SOME FRESH PRIZE SO FAR ROC'S CAREER HAD BEEN VERY MUCH LIKE THAT OF MANY OTHER COMPANIONS OF THE COAST
332-128985-0026 DIFFERING FROM THEM ONLY IN RESPECT TO INTENSITY AND FORCE BUT HE WAS A CLEVER MAN WITH IDEAS
332-128985-0027 HE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURING
332-128985-0028 AND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE ANY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE BAY WHICH WERE WELL LADEN AND WHICH WERE LIKELY SOON TO COME OUT SO WITH A SMALL BOAT FILLED WITH SOME OF HIS TRUSTY MEN HE ROWED QUIETLY INTO THE PORT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD DISCOVER
332-128985-0029 AND HAD SENT THAT MILD MANNERED OBSERVER INTO THE HARBOR TO INVESTIGATE INTO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS
332-128985-0030 BUT HE CHOSE TO GO HIMSELF AND HE CAME TO GRIEF NO SOONER DID THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIPS LYING IN THE HARBOR BEHOLD A BOAT APPROACHING WITH A BIG BROWED BROAD JAWED MARINER SITTING IN THE STERN
332-128985-0031 AND WITH A GOOD MANY MORE BROAD BACKED HAIRY MARINERS THAN WERE NECESSARY PULLING AT THE OARS THAN THEY GAVE THE ALARM
332-128985-0032 ROC MUST HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN HIS OWN POWERS OR PERHAPS HE RELIED SOMEWHAT UPON THE FEAR WHICH HIS VERY PRESENCE EVOKED BUT HE MADE A MISTAKE THIS TIME HE HAD RUN INTO THE LION'S JAW AND THE LION HAD CLOSED HIS TEETH UPON HIM
332-128985-0033 WHEN THE PIRATE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF PUTTING THEM TO TRIAL BUCCANEERS WERE OUTLAWED BY THE SPANISH
332-128985-0034 AND WERE CONSIDERED AS WILD BEASTS TO BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WHEREVER CAUGHT CONSEQUENTLY ROC AND HIS MEN WERE THROWN INTO A DUNGEON AND CONDEMNED TO BE EXECUTED IF HOWEVER THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIMSELF
332-128985-0035 DURING THE TIME THAT PREPARATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR MAKING EXAMPLES OF THESE IMPERTINENT PIRATES
332-128985-0036 THIS WAS A BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH A CAPABLE PIRATE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PROFICIENT IF HE COULD NOT GET HIMSELF OUT OF SCRAPES HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CUTTING DOWN SENTINELS
332-128985-0037 OR JUMPING OVERBOARD WITH A COUPLE OF WINE JARS FOR A LIFE PRESERVER OR OF DOING ANY OF THOSE ORDINARY THINGS WHICH PIRATES WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHEN ESCAPING FROM THEIR CAPTORS
332-128985-0038 INSIDE OF A FORTRESS AND IF THEY ESCAPED FROM THIS THEY WOULD FIND THEMSELVES UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF A BODY OF SPANISH SOLDIERS THEIR STOUT ARMS AND THEIR STOUT HEARTS WERE OF NO USE TO THEM NOW
332-128985-0039 AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVE
332-128985-0040 WHO CAME IN TO BRING HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND BY THE MEANS OF THIS MAN THE PIRATE HOPED TO PLAY A TRICK UPON THE GOVERNOR HE PROMISED THE SLAVE THAT IF HE WOULD HELP HIM AND HE TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO SO
332-128985-0041 HE WOULD GIVE HIM MONEY ENOUGH TO BUY HIS FREEDOM AND TO RETURN TO HIS FRIENDS AND THIS OF COURSE WAS A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO THE POOR FELLOW WHO MAY HAVE BEEN AN ENGLISHMAN OR A FRENCHMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES AT HOME THE SLAVE AGREED TO THE PROPOSALS
332-128985-0042 AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO BRING SOME WRITING MATERIALS TO ROC WHO THEREUPON BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF A LETTER
332-128985-0043 WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN
332-128985-0044 BY THE HAND OF ROC WENT ON TO SAY THAT IF ANY HARM SHOULD COME TO THESE BRAVE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AND IMPRISONED WHEN THEY WERE DOING NO HARM TO ANYBODY HE WOULD SWEAR IN HIS MOST SOLEMN MANNER THAT NEVER
332-128985-0045 FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WOULD HE GIVE QUARTER TO ANY SPANIARD WHO MIGHT FALL INTO HIS HANDS AND HE MOREOVER THREATENED THAT ANY KIND OF VENGEANCE WHICH SHOULD BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THE BUCCANEERS AND FRENCH UNITED TO INFLICT UPON THE SPANISH SHIPS
332-128985-0046 OR UPON THE TOWN OF CAMPEACHY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER HE SHOULD HEAR OF ANY INJURY THAT MIGHT BE INFLICTED UPON THE UNFORTUNATE MEN WHO WERE THEN LYING IMPRISONED IN THE FORTRESS WHEN THE SLAVE CAME BACK TO ROC
332-128985-0047 THE LETTER WAS GIVEN TO HIM WITH VERY PARTICULAR DIRECTIONS AS TO WHAT HE WAS TO DO WITH IT HE WAS TO DISGUISE HIMSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE PLACE AND THEN IN THE NIGHT HE WAS TO MAKE HIS WAY OUT OF THE TOWN
332-128985-0048 AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS TO RETURN AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR WHEN HE WAS TO STATE THAT HE HAD BEEN PUT ON SHORE FROM THE FRENCH VESSEL IN THE OFFING WITH A LETTER WHICH HE WAS TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR THE SLAVE PERFORMED HIS PART OF THE BUSINESS VERY WELL
332-128985-0049 THE NEXT DAY WET AND BEDRAGGLED FROM MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEEDS AND MUD OF THE COAST HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE FORTRESS WITH HIS LETTER AND WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR NO ONE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A PERSON EMPLOYED ABOUT THE PLACE
332-128985-0050 HAVING FULFILLED HIS MISSION HE DEPARTED AND WHEN SEEN AGAIN HE WAS THE SAME SERVANT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO CARRY FOOD TO THE PRISONERS THE GOVERNOR READ THE LETTER WITH A DISQUIETED MIND
332-128985-0051 HE KNEW THAT THE FRENCH SHIP WHICH WAS LYING OUTSIDE THE HARBOR WAS A POWERFUL VESSEL AND HE DID NOT LIKE FRENCH SHIPS ANYWAY THE TOWN HAD ONCE BEEN TAKEN AND VERY BADLY TREATED BY A LITTLE FLEET OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUCCANEERS
332-128985-0052 AND HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO GREAT SPANISH FORCE IN THE HARBOR AT THAT TIME AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUCCANEERING VESSELS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER TOGETHER IN THE BAY
332-128985-0053 IF IT SHOULD BECOME KNOWN THAT THE GREAT PIRATE ROC HAD BEEN PUT TO DEATH IN CAMPEACHY IT WAS AN UNUSUAL THING FOR A PRISONER TO HAVE SUCH POWERFUL FRIENDS SO NEAR BY AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK ROC'S CASE INTO MOST EARNEST CONSIDERATION
332-128985-0054 AND HE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE FELT HIMSELF IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO HAS STOLEN A BABY BEAR AND WHO HEARS THE ROAR OF AN APPROACHING PARENT THROUGH THE WOODS
332-128985-0055 TO THROW AWAY THE CUB AND WALK OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY BEARS IN THAT FOREST WOULD BE THE INCLINATION OF A MAN SO SITUATED AND TO GET RID OF THE GREAT PIRATE WITHOUT PROVOKING THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
332-128985-0056 WAS THE NATURAL INCLINATION OF THE GOVERNOR NOW ROC AND HIS MEN WERE TREATED WELL AND HAVING BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR WERE TOLD THAT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR HAVING COMMITTED NO OVERT ACT OF DISORDER THEY WOULD BE SET AT LIBERTY AND SHIPPED TO ENGLAND
332-128985-0057 UPON THE SINGLE CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD ABANDON PIRACY AND AGREE TO BECOME QUIET CITIZENS IN WHATEVER RESPECTABLE VOCATION THEY MIGHT SELECT TO THESE TERMS ROC AND HIS MEN AGREED WITHOUT ARGUMENT
332-128985-0058 THEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RETIRE FROM THE BUCCANEERING BUSINESS AND THAT NOTHING WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF CIVILIZATION AND VIRTUE THERE WAS A SHIP ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SPAIN AND ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GAVE ROC AND HIS MEN FREE PASSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN
332-128985-0059 THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OUR BUCCANEERS WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED TO HAVE BEEN PUT ON BOARD THE FRENCH VESSEL BUT AS THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD STARTED HIS PRISONERS ON THE ROAD TO REFORM HE DID NOT WISH TO THROW THEM INTO THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
332-128985-0060 BY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT
332-128985-0061 ON THE VOYAGE TO SPAIN ROC WAS ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO BEHAVE VERY WELL WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NO DOUBT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY DULL DAYS ON BOARD SHIP
332-128985-0062 WHEN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN DELIGHTED TO GAMBLE TO GET DRUNK AND TO RUN AMUCK UP AND DOWN THE DECK BUT HE CAREFULLY ABSTAINED FROM ALL THESE RECREATIONS AND SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE SUCH AN ABLE BODIED AND WILLING SAILOR
332-128985-0063 THAT THE CAPTAIN ALLOWED HIM TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE CREW ROC KNEW HOW TO DO A GREAT MANY THINGS NOT ONLY COULD HE MURDER AND ROB BUT HE KNEW HOW TO TURN AN HONEST PENNY WHEN THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF FILLING HIS PURSE HE HAD LEARNED AMONG THE INDIANS
332-128985-0064 HOW TO SHOOT FISH WITH BOW AND ARROWS AND ON THIS VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HE OCCUPIED ALL HIS SPARE TIME IN SITTING IN THE RIGGING AND SHOOTING THE FISH WHICH DISPORTED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE VESSEL
332-128985-0065 THESE FISH HE SOLD TO THE OFFICERS AND WE ARE TOLD THAT IN THIS WAY HE EARNED NO LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED CROWNS PERHAPS THAT MANY DOLLARS IF THIS ACCOUNT IS TRUE FISH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY COSTLY IN THOSE DAYS
332-128985-0066 IN EVERY WAY ROC BEHAVED SO WELL THAT FOR HIS SAKE ALL HIS MEN WERE TREATED KINDLY AND ALLOWED MANY PRIVILEGES BUT WHEN THIS PARTY OF REFORMED PIRATES REACHED SPAIN AND WERE ALLOWED TO GO WHERE THEY PLEASED
332-128985-0067 THEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE OATHS THEY HAD TAKEN TO ABANDON PIRACY THAN THEY THOUGHT OF THE OATHS WHICH THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING RIGHT AND LEFT
332-128985-0068 BUT AS SOON AS THEY COULD MANAGE IT THEY SAILED BACK TO THE WEST INDIES AND EVENTUALLY FOUND THEMSELVES IN JAMAICA
332-128985-0069 NOT ONLY DID ROC CAST FROM HIM EVERY THOUGHT OF REFORMATION AND A RESPECTABLE LIFE BUT HE DETERMINED TO BEGIN THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY ON A GRANDER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE HE MADE A COMPACT WITH AN OLD FRENCH BUCCANEER
332-128985-0070 AND WITH A LARGE COMPANY OF BUCCANEERS HE ACTUALLY SET OUT TO TAKE A TOWN HAVING LOST EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND HAVING PASSED SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYMENT MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF SHOOTING FISH WITH A BOW AND ARROWS
332-128985-0071 OUR DOUGHTY PIRATE NOW DESIRED TO MAKE A GRAND STRIKE AND IF HE COULD TAKE A TOWN AND PILLAGE IT OF EVERYTHING VALUABLE IT CONTAINED HE WOULD MAKE A VERY GOOD FORTUNE IN A VERY SHORT TIME AND MIGHT RETIRE IF HE CHOSE
332-128985-0072 FROM THE ACTIVE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION
332-128985-0073 IN YUCATAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A BOLD AND RASH UNDERTAKING THE TWO PIRATES WERE BOLD AND RASH ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ROC HAD BEEN A PRISONER IN MERIDA AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOWN HE BELIEVED THAT HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS COULD LAND UPON THE COAST
332-128985-0074 IF THEY COULD DO THIS IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER TO RUSH UPON THE UNSUSPECTING GARRISON AND HAVING ANNIHILATED THESE MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE TOWN BUT THEIR PLANS DID NOT WORK VERY WELL THEY WERE DISCOVERED BY SOME INDIANS
332-128985-0075 AFTER THEY HAD LANDED WHO HURRIED TO MERIDA AND GAVE NOTICE OF THE APPROACH OF THE BUCCANEERS CONSEQUENTLY WHEN ROC AND HIS COMPANIONS REACHED THE TOWN THEY FOUND THE GARRISON PREPARED FOR THEM CANNONS LOADED AND ALL THE APPROACHES GUARDED
332-128985-0076 STILL THE PIRATES DID NOT HESITATE THEY ADVANCED FIERCELY TO THE ATTACK JUST AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE BOARDING A SPANISH VESSEL BUT THEY SOON FOUND THAT FIGHTING ON LAND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING AT SEA
332-128985-0077 IN A MARINE COMBAT IT IS SELDOM THAT A PARTY OF BOARDERS IS ATTACKED IN THE REAR BY THE ENEMY ALTHOUGH ON LAND SUCH METHODS OF WARFARE MAY ALWAYS BE EXPECTED
332-128985-0078 AND THEY WERE THEREFORE GREATLY DISMAYED WHEN A PARTY OF HORSEMEN FROM THE TOWN WHO HAD MADE A WIDE DETOUR THROUGH THE WOODS SUDDENLY CHARGED UPON THEIR REAR
332-128985-0079 TRIBUTOR AND A GREAT MANY OF THE PIRATES WERE KILLED OR TAKEN AND ROC THE BRAZILIAN HAD A TERRIBLE FALL THIS MOST MEMORABLE FALL OCCURRED IN THE ESTIMATION OF JOHN ESQUEMELING
332-128985-0080 WHO KNEW ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK ON MERIDA AND WHO WROTE THE ACCOUNT OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO BE CALLED UPON TO RECORD THAT HIS GREAT HERO ROC THE BRAZILIAN SAVED HIS LIFE AFTER THE UTTER DEFEAT OF HIMSELF AND HIS COMPANIONS
332-128985-0081 BY IGNOMINIOUSLY RUNNING AWAY THE LOYAL CHRONICLER HAD AS FIRM A BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE INABILITY OF HIS HERO TO FLY FROM DANGER AS WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTTISH DOUGLAS WHEN HE STOOD
332-128985-0082 COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
332-128985-0083 WHO WOULD EVEN SURRENDER TO SAY NOTHING OF RUNNING AWAY THAT ESQUEMELING COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THAT ROC HAD RETREATED FROM HIS ENEMIES DESERTED HIS FRIENDS AND TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE PRINCIPLES WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS SO TRUCULENTLY PROCLAIMED
332-128985-0084 BUT THIS DOWNFALL OF A HERO SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ESQUEMELING ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PIRATICAL BODY AND WAS PROUD TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A BUCCANEER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF A PIRATE UNDER THE BRUTALITY
332-128985-0085 THE CRUELTY THE DISHONESTY AND THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE SEA ROBBERS OF THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS MEANNESS AND COWARDICE ROC AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SKETCH WAS A TYPICAL PIRATE
332-128985-0086 UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED HIMSELF TO HAVE ALL THOSE BRAVE AND SAVAGE QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING ESTEEMED AND REVERED AND UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES HE SHOWED THOSE OTHER QUALITIES WHICH ESQUEMELING DESPISED
332-128985-0087 BUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE TRUE CHARACTER OF A PIRATE THE HISTORIAN JOHN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH CUT UP BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS FAVORITE HERO HAD ROUNDED OFF HIS PIRATICAL CAREER
332-128985-0088 AND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLES
3486-166424-0000 AS I GAZED UPON THEM I WONDERED TO WHAT SECRET PLACE WITHIN THEIR BROODING IMMENSITIES THE LITTLE METAL MYSTERIES HAD FLED AND TO WHAT MYRIADS IT MIGHT BE OF THEIR KIND
3486-166424-0001 OF WHAT POWERS SMALL LIKE THESE OR OR QUICK ON THE SCREEN OF MY MIND FLASHED TWO PICTURES SIDE BY SIDE
3486-166424-0002 THE LITTLE FOUR RAYED PRINT IN THE GREAT DUST OF THE CRUMBLING RUIN AND ITS COLOSSAL TWIN ON THE BREAST OF THE POPPIED VALLEY I TURNED ASIDE CREPT THROUGH THE SHATTERED PORTAL AND LOOKED OVER THE HAUNTED HOLLOW UNBELIEVING I RUBBED MY EYES
3486-166424-0003 THEN LEAPED TO THE VERY BRIM OF THE BOWL A LARK HAD RISEN FROM THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE SHATTERED HEAPS AND HAD FLOWN CAROLING UP INTO THE SHADOWY SKY A FLOCK OF THE LITTLE WILLOW WARBLERS FLUNG THEMSELVES ACROSS THE VALLEY SCOLDING AND GOSSIPING
3486-166424-0004 A HARE SAT UPRIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANCIENT ROADWAY THE VALLEY ITSELF LAY SERENELY UNDER THE AMBERING LIGHT SMILING PEACEFUL EMPTIED OF HORROR
3486-166424-0005 I DROPPED OVER THE SIDE WALKED CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE ROAD UP WHICH BUT AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE WE HAD STRUGGLED SO DESPERATELY PACED FARTHER AND FARTHER WITH AN INCREASING CONFIDENCE AND A GROWING WONDER
3486-166424-0006 GONE WAS THAT SOUL OF LONELINESS VANISHED THE WHIRLPOOL OF DESPAIR THAT HAD STRIVEN TO DRAG US DOWN TO DEATH THE BOWL WAS NOTHING BUT A QUIET SMILING LOVELY LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE HILLS I LOOKED BACK
3486-166424-0007 EVEN THE RUINS HAD LOST THEIR SINISTER SHAPE WERE TIME WORN CRUMBLING PILES NOTHING MORE
3486-166424-0008 A RIFLE SHOT RANG OUT ABOVE US ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FROM THE PORTAL SCAMPERED CHIU MING HIS ROBE TUCKED UP ABOUT HIS KNEES THEY COME HE GASPED THEY COME
3486-166424-0009 DOWN IT WAS POURING AN AVALANCHE OF MEN I CAUGHT THE GLINT OF HELMETS AND CORSELETS THOSE IN THE VAN WERE MOUNTED GALLOPING TWO ABREAST UPON SURE FOOTED MOUNTAIN PONIES THEIR SHORT SWORDS LIFTED HIGH FLICKERED
3486-166424-0010 AFTER THE HORSEMEN SWARMED FOOT SOLDIERS A FOREST OF SHINING POINTS AND DULLY GLEAMING PIKES ABOVE THEM CLEARLY TO US CAME THEIR BATTLECRIES AGAIN VENTNOR'S RIFLE CRACKED ONE OF THE FOREMOST RIDERS WENT DOWN ANOTHER STUMBLED OVER HIM FELL
3486-166424-0011 THE RUSH WAS CHECKED FOR AN INSTANT MILLING UPON THE ROAD DICK I CRIED RUSH RUTH OVER TO THE TUNNEL MOUTH WE'LL FOLLOW WE CAN HOLD THEM THERE I'LL GET MARTIN CHIU MING AFTER THE PONY QUICK I PUSHED THE TWO OVER THE RIM OF THE HOLLOW
3486-166424-0012 QUICK MART I SHOUTED UP THE SHATTERED STAIRWAY WE CAN GET THROUGH THE HOLLOW RUTH AND DRAKE ARE ON THEIR WAY TO THE BREAK WE CAME THROUGH HURRY ALL RIGHT JUST A MINUTE HE CALLED I HEARD HIM EMPTY HIS MAGAZINE WITH ALMOST MACHINE GUN QUICKNESS
3486-166424-0013 ALL MY AMMUNITION IS ON HIM CHIU MING'S TAKING CARE OF THAT I GASPED WE DARTED OUT OF THE GATEWAY A GOOD FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY WERE RUTH AND DRAKE RUNNING STRAIGHT TO THE GREEN TUNNEL'S MOUTH BETWEEN THEM AND US WAS CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY
3486-166424-0014 AS WE SPED AFTER HIM I LOOKED BACK THE HORSEMEN HAD RECOVERED WERE NOW A SCANT HALF MILE FROM WHERE THE ROAD SWEPT PAST THE FORTRESS I SAW THAT WITH THEIR SWORDS THE HORSEMEN BORE GREAT BOWS A LITTLE CLOUD OF ARROWS SPARKLED FROM THEM
3486-166424-0015 FELL FAR SHORT DON'T LOOK BACK GRUNTED VENTNOR STRETCH YOURSELF WALTER THERE'S A SURPRISE COMING HOPE TO GOD I JUDGED THE TIME RIGHT WE TURNED OFF THE RUINED WAY
3486-166424-0016 HE REACHED OUT TOUCHED ME YOU'RE RIGHT WALTER HE GRINNED IT DOES SEEM LIKE CARRYING COALS TO NEWCASTLE
3486-166424-0017 SCATTERED PRONE AMONG THESE WERE MEN AND HORSES OTHERS STAGGERED SCREAMING ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF THIS STONY DIKE OUR PURSUERS WERE HELD LIKE RUSHING WATERS BEHIND A SUDDEN FALLEN TREE TIMED TO A SECOND CRIED VENTNOR HOLD EM FOR A WHILE
3486-166424-0018 AND HOLDING RUTH BY THE HAND RACE BACK TOWARD US EVEN AS HE TURNED THE VINE SCREENED ENTRANCE THROUGH WHICH WE HAD COME THROUGH WHICH WE HAD THOUGHT LAY SAFETY STREAMED OTHER ARMORED MEN WE WERE OUTFLANKED TO THE FISSURE SHOUTED VENTNOR
3486-166424-0019 DRAKE HEARD FOR HE CHANGED HIS COURSE TO THE CREVICE AT WHOSE MOUTH RUTH HAD SAID THE LITTLE THINGS HAD LAIN AFTER HIM STREAKED CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY SHOUTING OUT OF THE TUNNEL DOWN OVER THE LIP OF THE BOWL LEAPED THE SOLDIERS
3486-166424-0020 WE DROPPED UPON OUR KNEES SENT SHOT AFTER SHOT INTO THEM THEY FELL BACK HESITATED WE SPRANG UP SPED ON ALL TOO SHORT WAS THE CHECK BUT ONCE MORE WE HELD THEM AND AGAIN NOW RUTH AND DICK WERE A SCANT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE CREVICE I SAW HIM STOP
3486-166424-0021 PUSH HER FROM HIM TOWARD IT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NOW CHIU MING WAS WITH THEM RUTH SPRANG TO THE PONY LIFTED FROM ITS BACK A RIFLE THEN INTO THE MASS OF THEIR PURSUERS DRAKE AND SHE POURED A FUSILLADE THEY HUDDLED WAVERED BROKE FOR COVER
3486-166424-0022 A CHANCE GASPED VENTNOR BEHIND US WAS A WOLFLIKE YELPING THE FIRST PACK HAD RE FORMED HAD CROSSED THE BARRICADE THE DYNAMITE HAD MADE WAS RUSHING UPON US I RAN AS I HAD NEVER KNOWN I COULD
3486-166424-0023 OVER US WHINED THE BULLETS FROM THE COVERING GUNS CLOSE WERE WE NOW TO THE MOUTH OF THE FISSURE IF WE COULD BUT REACH IT CLOSE CLOSE WERE OUR PURSUERS TOO THE ARROWS CLOSER NO USE SAID VENTNOR
3486-166424-0024 NATURE'S SUMMONING OF EVERY RESERVE TO MEET THAT PERIL MY EYES TOOK THEM IN WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC NICETY THE LINKED MAIL LACQUERED BLUE AND SCARLET OF THE HORSEMEN BROWN PADDED ARMOR OF THE FOOTMEN
3486-166424-0025 THEIR BOWS AND JAVELINS AND SHORT BRONZE SWORDS THEIR PIKES AND SHIELDS AND UNDER THEIR ROUND HELMETS THEIR CRUEL BEARDED FACES WHITE AS OUR OWN WHERE THE BLACK BEARDS DID NOT COVER THEM THEIR FIERCE AND MOCKING EYES
3486-166424-0026 IN THIS WORLD OF OURS TWENTY CENTURIES BEYOND THEIR TIME SWIFTLY ACCURATELY EVEN AS I SCANNED THEM WE HAD BEEN DRILLING INTO THEM THEY ADVANCED DELIBERATELY HEEDLESS OF THEIR FALLEN THEIR ARROWS HAD CEASED TO FLY
3486-166424-0027 I WONDERED WHY FOR NOW WE WERE WELL WITHIN THEIR RANGE
3486-166424-0028 WE'VE SAVED RUTH ANYWAY HE SAID DRAKE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THAT HOLE IN THE WALL HE'S GOT LOTS OF AMMUNITION ON THE PONY BUT THEY'VE GOT US ANOTHER WILD SHOUTING DOWN SWEPT THE PACK
3486-166424-0029 WE LEAPED TO OUR FEET SENT OUR LAST BULLETS INTO THEM STOOD READY RIFLES CLUBBED TO MEET THE RUSH I HEARD RUTH SCREAM WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE ARMORED MEN WHY HAD THEY HALTED
3486-166424-0030 WHAT WAS IT AT WHICH THEY WERE GLARING OVER OUR HEADS AND WHY HAD THE RIFLE FIRE OF RUTH AND DRAKE CEASED SO ABRUPTLY SIMULTANEOUSLY WE TURNED WITHIN THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF THE FISSURE STOOD A SHAPE AN APPARITION
3486-166424-0031 A WOMAN BEAUTIFUL AWESOME INCREDIBLE SHE WAS TALL STANDING THERE SWATHED FROM CHIN TO FEET IN CLINGING VEILS OF PALE AMBER SHE SEEMED TALLER EVEN THAN TALL DRAKE
3486-166424-0032 YET IT WAS NOT HER HEIGHT THAT SENT THROUGH ME THE THRILL OF AWE OF HALF INCREDULOUS TERROR WHICH RELAXING MY GRIP LET MY SMOKING RIFLE DROP TO EARTH NOR WAS IT THAT ABOUT HER PROUD HEAD A CLOUD OF SHINING TRESSES SWIRLED AND PENNONED
3486-166424-0033 LIKE A MISTY BANNER OF WOVEN COPPER FLAMES NO NOR THAT THROUGH HER VEILS HER BODY GLEAMED FAINT RADIANCE IT WAS HER EYES HER GREAT WIDE EYES WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS WERE LIKE POOLS OF LIVING STAR FIRES
3486-166424-0034 THEY SHONE FROM HER WHITE FACE NOT PHOSPHORESCENT NOT MERELY LUCENT AND LIGHT REFLECTING BUT AS THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES WERE SOURCES OF THE COLD WHITE FLAMES OF FAR STARS AND AS CALM AS THOSE STARS THEMSELVES
3486-166424-0035 AND IN THAT FACE ALTHOUGH AS YET I COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT THE EYES I SENSED SOMETHING UNEARTHLY GOD WHISPERED VENTNOR WHAT IS SHE
3486-166424-0036 THE WOMAN STEPPED FROM THE CREVICE NOT FIFTY FEET FROM HER WERE RUTH AND DRAKE AND CHIU MING THEIR RIGID ATTITUDES REVEALING THE SAME SHOCK OF AWE THAT HAD MOMENTARILY PARALYZED ME SHE LOOKED AT THEM BECKONED THEM
3486-166424-0037 I SAW THE TWO WALK TOWARD HER CHIU MING HANG BACK THE GREAT EYES FELL UPON VENTNOR AND MYSELF SHE RAISED A HAND MOTIONED US TO APPROACH I TURNED THERE STOOD THE HOST THAT HAD POURED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ROAD
3486-166424-0038 HORSEMEN SPEARSMEN PIKEMEN A FULL THOUSAND OF THEM AT MY RIGHT WERE THE SCATTERED COMPANY THAT HAD COME FROM THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE THREESCORE OR MORE THERE SEEMED A SPELL UPON THEM
3486-166424-0039 THEY STOOD IN SILENCE LIKE AUTOMATONS ONLY THEIR FIERCELY STARING EYES SHOWING THAT THEY WERE ALIVE QUICK BREATHED VENTNOR WE RAN TOWARD HER WHO HAD CHECKED DEATH EVEN WHILE ITS JAWS WERE CLOSING UPON US
3486-166424-0040 BEFORE WE HAD GONE HALF WAY AS THOUGH OUR FLIGHT HAD BROKEN WHATEVER BONDS HAD BOUND THEM A CLAMOR AROSE FROM THE HOST A WILD SHOUTING A CLANGING OF SWORDS ON SHIELDS I SHOT A GLANCE BEHIND THEY WERE IN MOTION ADVANCING SLOWLY
3486-166424-0041 HESITATINGLY AS YET BUT I KNEW THAT SOON THAT HESITATION WOULD PASS THAT THEY WOULD SWEEP DOWN UPON US ENGULF US TO THE CREVICE I SHOUTED TO DRAKE HE PAID NO HEED TO ME NOR DID RUTH
3486-166424-0042 THEIR GAZE FASTENED UPON THE SWATHED WOMAN VENTNOR'S HAND SHOT OUT GRIPPED MY SHOULDER HALTED ME SHE HAD THROWN UP HER HEAD
3486-166424-0043 FROM THE LIFTED THROAT CAME A LOW A VIBRANT CRY HARMONIOUS WEIRDLY DISQUIETING GOLDEN AND SWEET AND LADEN WITH THE EERY MINOR WAILINGS OF THE BLUE VALLEY'S NIGHT THE DRAGONED CHAMBER
3486-166424-0044 BEFORE THE CRY HAD CEASED THERE POURED WITH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS OUT OF THE CREVICE SCORE UPON SCORE OF THE METAL THINGS THE FISSURES VOMITED THEM
3486-166424-0045 GLOBES AND CUBES AND PYRAMIDS NOT SMALL LIKE THOSE OF THE RUINS BUT SHAPES ALL OF FOUR FEET HIGH DULLY LUSTROUS AND DEEP WITHIN THAT LUSTER THE MYRIADS OF TINY POINTS OF LIGHT LIKE UNWINKING STARING EYES
3486-166424-0046 THEY SWIRLED EDDIED AND FORMED A BARRICADE BETWEEN US AND THE ARMORED MEN DOWN UPON THEM POURED A SHOWER OF ARROWS FROM THE SOLDIERS I HEARD THE SHOUTS OF THEIR CAPTAINS THEY RUSHED THEY HAD COURAGE THOSE MEN YES AGAIN CAME THE WOMAN'S CRY
3486-166424-0047 UP FROM THEM THRUST A THICK RECTANGULAR COLUMN
3486-166424-0048 EIGHT FEET IN WIDTH AND TWENTY FEET HIGH IT SHAPED ITSELF OUT FROM ITS LEFT SIDE FROM RIGHT SIDE SPRANG ARMS FEARFUL ARMS THAT GREW AND GREW AS GLOBE AND CUBE AND ANGLE RACED UP THE COLUMN'S SIDE AND CLICKED INTO PLACE EACH UPON EACH AFTER THE OTHER
3486-166424-0049 WITH MAGICAL QUICKNESS THE ARMS LENGTHENED BEFORE US STOOD A MONSTROUS SHAPE A GEOMETRIC PRODIGY
3486-166424-0050 A SHINING ANGLED PILLAR THAT THOUGH RIGID IMMOBILE SEEMED TO CROUCH BE INSTINCT WITH LIVING FORCE STRIVING TO BE UNLEASHED TWO GREAT GLOBES SURMOUNTED IT
3486-166424-0051 FLEXING THEMSELVES IN GROTESQUE IMITATION OF A BOXER
3486-166424-0052 AGAIN IN GIGANTIC AWFUL PARODY OF THE SPIKED GLOVES OF THOSE ANCIENT GLADIATORS WHO FOUGHT FOR IMPERIAL NERO
3486-166424-0053 PREENING TESTING ITSELF LIKE AN ATHLETE
3486-166424-0054 UNDER THE DARKENING SKY IN THE GREEN OF THE HOLLOW THE ARMORED HOSTS FROZEN BEFORE IT AND THEN IT STRUCK OUT FLASHED TWO OF THE ARMS WITH A GLANCING MOTION WITH APPALLING FORCE
3486-166424-0055 THEY SLICED INTO THE CLOSE PACKED FORWARD RANKS OF THE ARMORED MEN CUT OUT OF THEM TWO GREAT GAPS SICKENED I SAW FRAGMENTS OF MAN AND HORSE FLY ANOTHER ARM JAVELINED FROM ITS PLACE LIKE A FLYING SNAKE CLICKED AT THE END OF ANOTHER
3486-166424-0056 BECAME A HUNDRED FOOT CHAIN WHICH SWIRLED LIKE A FLAIL THROUGH THE HUDDLING MASS DOWN UPON A KNOT OF THE SOLDIERS WITH A STRAIGHT FORWARD BLOW DROVE A THIRD ARM DRIVING THROUGH THEM LIKE A GIANT PUNCH
3486-166424-0057 ALL THAT HOST WHICH HAD DRIVEN US FROM THE RUINS THREW DOWN SWORD SPEAR AND PIKE FLED SHRIEKING THE HORSEMEN SPURRED THEIR MOUNTS RIDING HEEDLESS OVER THE FOOTMEN WHO FLED WITH THEM THE SMITING THING SEEMED TO WATCH THEM GO
3486-166424-0058 WITH AMUSEMENT BEFORE THEY COULD COVER A HUNDRED YARDS IT HAD DISINTEGRATED I HEARD THE LITTLE WAILING SOUNDS THEN BEHIND THE FLEEING MEN CLOSE BEHIND THEM ROSE THE ANGLED PILLAR INTO PLACE SPRANG THE FLEXING ARMS AND AGAIN IT TOOK ITS TOLL OF THEM
3486-166424-0059 THEY SCATTERED RUNNING SINGLY BY TWOS IN LITTLE GROUPS FOR THE SIDES OF THE VALLEY THEY WERE LIKE RATS SCAMPERING IN PANIC OVER THE BOTTOM OF A GREAT GREEN BOWL AND LIKE A MONSTROUS CAT THE SHAPE PLAYED WITH THEM YES PLAYED
3486-166424-0060 IT MELTED ONCE MORE TOOK NEW FORM WHERE HAD BEEN PILLAR AND FLAILING ARMS WAS NOW A TRIPOD THIRTY FEET HIGH ITS LEGS ALTERNATE GLOBE AND CUBE AND UPON ITS APEX A WIDE AND SPINNING RING OF SPARKLING SPHERES
3486-166424-0061 OUT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THIS RING STRETCHED A TENTACLE WRITHING UNDULATING LIKE A SERPENT OF STEEL FOUR SCORE YARDS AT LEAST IN LENGTH
3486-166424-0062 WITH THE THREE LONG PRONGS OF THIS TRIDENT THE THING STRUCK SWIFTLY
3486-166424-0063 IT WAS I THINK THAT LAST TOUCH OF SHEER HORROR THE PLAYFULNESS OF THE SMITING THING THAT SENT MY DRY TONGUE TO THE ROOF OF MY TERROR PARCHED MOUTH AND HELD OPEN WITH MONSTROUS FASCINATION EYES THAT STRUGGLED TO CLOSE
3486-166424-0064 EVER THE ARMORED MEN FLED FROM IT AND EVER WAS IT SWIFTER THAN THEY TEETERING AT THEIR HEELS ON ITS TRIPOD LEGS FROM HALF ITS LENGTH THE DARTING SNAKE STREAMED RED RAIN I HEARD A SIGH FROM RUTH
3486-166424-0065 WRESTED MY GAZE FROM THE HOLLOW TURNED SHE LAY FAINTING IN DRAKE'S ARMS BESIDE THE TWO THE SWATHED WOMAN STOOD LOOKING OUT UPON THAT SLAUGHTER CALM AND STILL SHROUDED WITH AN UNEARTHLY TRANQUILLITY
3486-166424-0066 VIEWING IT IT CAME TO ME WITH EYES IMPERSONAL COLD INDIFFERENT AS THE UNTROUBLED STARS WHICH LOOK DOWN UPON HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE IN THIS WORLD OF OURS THERE WAS A RUSHING OF MANY FEET AT OUR LEFT A WAIL FROM CHIU MING
3486-166424-0067 WERE THEY MADDENED BY FEAR DRIVEN BY DESPAIR DETERMINED TO SLAY BEFORE THEY THEMSELVES WERE SLAIN I DO NOT KNOW BUT THOSE WHO STILL LIVED OF THE MEN FROM THE TUNNEL MOUTH WERE CHARGING US THEY CLUSTERED CLOSE THEIR SHIELDS HELD BEFORE THEM
3486-166424-0068 THEY HAD NO BOWS THESE MEN THEY MOVED SWIFTLY DOWN UPON US IN SILENCE SWORDS AND PIKES GLEAMING THE SMITING THING ROCKED TOWARD US THE METAL TENTACLE STRAINING OUT LIKE A RIGID RACING SERPENT FLYING TO CUT BETWEEN ITS WEIRD MISTRESS AND THOSE WHO MENACED HER
3486-166424-0069 I HEARD CHIU MING SCREAM SAW HIM THROW UP HIS HANDS COVER HIS EYES RUN STRAIGHT UPON THE PIKES CHIU MING I SHOUTED CHIU MING THIS WAY I RAN TOWARD HIM
3486-166424-0070 I SAW A SPEAR THROWN IT STRUCK THE CHINAMAN SQUARELY IN THE BREAST HE TOTTERED FELL UPON HIS KNEES EVEN AS HE DROPPED THE GIANT FLAIL SWEPT DOWN UPON THE SOLDIERS IT SWEPT THROUGH THEM LIKE A SCYTHE THROUGH RIPE GRAIN
3486-166424-0071 IT THREW THEM BROKEN AND TORN FAR TOWARD THE VALLEY'S SLOPING SIDES IT LEFT ONLY FRAGMENTS THAT BORE NO SEMBLANCE TO MEN VENTNOR WAS AT CHIU MING'S HEAD I DROPPED BESIDE HIM THERE WAS A CRIMSON FROTH UPON HIS LIPS
3486-166424-0072 I THOUGHT THAT SHIN JE WAS ABOUT TO SLAY US HE WHISPERED FEAR BLINDED ME HIS HEAD DROPPED HIS BODY QUIVERED LAY STILL WE AROSE LOOKED ABOUT US DAZEDLY
3486-166424-0073 AT THE SIDE OF THE CREVICE STOOD THE WOMAN HER GAZE RESTING UPON DRAKE HIS ARMS ABOUT RUTH HER HEAD HIDDEN ON HIS BREAST THE VALLEY WAS EMPTY SAVE FOR THE HUDDLED HEAPS THAT DOTTED IT
3486-166424-0074 HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN PATH A SCORE OF FIGURES CREPT ALL THAT WERE LEFT OF THOSE WHO BUT A LITTLE BEFORE HAD STREAMED DOWN TO TAKE US CAPTIVE OR TO SLAY
3486-166424-0075 HIGH UP IN THE DARKENING HEAVENS THE LAMMERGEIERS THE WINGED SCAVENGERS OF THE HIMALAYAS WERE GATHERING THE WOMAN LIFTED HER HAND BECKONED US ONCE MORE SLOWLY WE WALKED TOWARD HER STOOD BEFORE HER
3486-166446-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE DRUMS OF DESTINY SLOWLY WE DESCENDED THAT MOUNT OF DESOLATION LINGERINGLY AS THOUGH THE BROODING EYES OF NORHALA WERE NOT YET SATED WITH DESTRUCTION
3486-166446-0001 OF HUMAN LIFE OF GREEN LIFE OF LIFE OF ANY KIND THERE WAS NONE
3486-166446-0002 PALACE TEMPLE AND HOME NORHALA HAD STAMPED FLAT SHE HAD CRUSHED THEM WITHIN THE ROCK EVEN AS SHE HAD PROMISED THE TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY HAD ABSORBED MY EVERY FACULTY
3486-166446-0003 NOW IN THE PAINFUL SURGES OF AWAKENING REALIZATION OF FULL HUMAN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT INHUMAN ANNIHILATION I TURNED TO THEM FOR STRENGTH FAINTLY I WONDERED AGAIN AT RUTH'S SCANTINESS OF GARB HER MORE THAN HALF NUDITY
3486-166446-0004 DWELT CURIOUSLY UPON THE RED BRAND ACROSS VENTNOR'S FOREHEAD
3486-166446-0005 BUT IN THE EYES OF RUTH WAS NONE OF THIS STERNLY COLDLY TRIUMPHANT INDIFFERENT TO ITS PITEOUSNESS AS NORHALA HERSELF SHE SCANNED THE WASTE THAT LESS THAN AN HOUR SINCE HAD BEEN A PLACE OF LIVING BEAUTY I FELT A SHOCK OF REPULSION AFTER ALL
3486-166446-0006 YET MOTHER AND BLOSSOMING MAID YOUTH AND OLDSTER ALL THE PAGEANT OF HUMANITY WITHIN THE GREAT WALLS WERE NOW BUT LINES WITHIN THE STONE ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT LIGHTS IT CAME TO ME THERE HAD BEEN
3486-166446-0007 FROM NORHALA OF COURSE I LOOKED FOR NO PERCEPTION OF ANY OF THIS BUT FROM RUTH MY REACTION GREW
3486-166446-0008 THERE WAS DRIED BLOOD ON THE EDGES A DOUBLE RING OF SWOLLEN WHITE FLESH RIMMING THE CINCTURE IT WAS THE MARK OF TORTURE MARTIN I CRIED THAT RING WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU THEY WAKED ME WITH THAT HE ANSWERED QUIETLY
3486-166446-0009 I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL ALTHOUGH THEIR INTENTIONS WERE NOT EXACTLY THERAPEUTIC THEY TORTURED HIM RUTH'S VOICE WAS TENSE BITTER SHE SPOKE IN PERSIAN FOR NORHALA'S BENEFIT I THOUGHT THEN NOT GUESSING A DEEPER REASON
3486-166446-0010 THEY TORTURED HIM THEY GAVE HIM AGONY UNTIL HE RETURNED AND THEY PROMISED HIM OTHER AGONIES THAT WOULD MAKE HIM PRAY LONG FOR DEATH AND ME ME SHE RAISED LITTLE CLENCHED HANDS
3486-166446-0011 ME THEY STRIPPED LIKE A SLAVE THEY LED ME THROUGH THE CITY AND THE PEOPLE MOCKED ME
3486-166446-0012 BEFORE MY EYES THEY TORTURED MY BROTHER NORHALA THEY WERE EVIL ALL EVIL NORHALA YOU DID WELL TO SLAY THEM SHE CAUGHT THE WOMAN'S HANDS PRESSED CLOSE TO HER
3486-166446-0013 NORHALA GAZED AT HER FROM GREAT GRAY EYES IN WHICH THE WRATH WAS DYING INTO WHICH THE OLD TRANQUILLITY THE OLD SERENITY WAS FLOWING AND WHEN SHE SPOKE THE GOLDEN VOICE HELD MORE THAN RETURNING ECHOES OF THE FAR AWAY FAINT CHIMINGS IT IS DONE SHE SAID
3486-166446-0014 AND IT WAS WELL DONE SISTER NOW YOU AND I SHALL DWELL TOGETHER IN PEACE SISTER OR IF THERE BE THOSE IN THE WORLD FROM WHICH YOU CAME THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SLAIN
3486-166446-0015 THEN YOU AND I SHALL GO FORTH WITH OUR COMPANIES AND STAMP THEM OUT EVEN AS I DID THESE MY HEART STOPPED BEATING FOR FROM THE DEPTHS OF RUTH'S EYES SHINING SHADOWS WERE RISING WRAITHS ANSWERING NORHALA'S CALLING
3486-166446-0016 AND AS THEY ROSE STEADILY THEY DREW LIFE FROM THE CLEAR RADIANCE SUMMONING DREW CLOSER TO THE SEMBLANCE OF THAT TRANQUIL SPIRIT WHICH HER VENGEANCE HAD BANISHED
3486-166446-0017 AND AT LAST IT WAS TWIN SISTER OF NORHALA WHO LOOKED UPON HER FROM THE FACE OF RUTH THE WHITE ARMS OF THE WOMAN ENCIRCLED HER THE GLORIOUS HEAD BENT OVER HER FLAMING TRESSES MINGLED WITH TENDER BROWN CURLS
3486-166446-0018 SISTER SHE WHISPERED LITTLE SISTER THESE MEN YOU SHALL HAVE AS LONG AS IT PLEASES YOU TO DO WITH AS YOU WILL OR IF IT IS YOUR WISH THEY SHALL GO BACK TO THEIR WORLD AND I WILL GUARD THEM TO ITS GATES
3486-166446-0019 BUT YOU AND I LITTLE SISTER WILL DWELL TOGETHER IN THE VASTNESSES IN THE PEACE SHALL IT NOT BE SO WITH NO FALTERING WITH NO GLANCE TOWARD US THREE
3486-166446-0020 LOVER BROTHER OLD FRIEND RUTH CREPT CLOSER TO HER RESTED HER HEAD UPON THE VIRGINAL ROYAL BREASTS IT SHALL BE SO SHE MURMURED SISTER IT SHALL BE SO NORHALA I AM TIRED NORHALA I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF MEN
3486-166446-0021 AN ECSTASY OF TENDERNESS A FLAME OF UNEARTHLY RAPTURE TREMBLED OVER THE WOMAN'S WONDROUS FACE HUNGRILY DEFIANTLY SHE PRESSED THE GIRL TO HER THE STARS IN THE LUCID HEAVENS OF HER EYES WERE SOFT AND GENTLE AND CARESSING
3486-166446-0022 RUTH CRIED DRAKE AND SPRANG TOWARD THEM SHE PAID NO HEED AND EVEN AS HE LEAPED HE WAS CAUGHT WHIRLED BACK AGAINST US WAIT SAID VENTNOR
3486-166446-0023 THERE WAS A CURIOUS UNDERSTANDING IN HIS VOICE A CURIOUS SYMPATHY TOO IN THE PATIENT UNTROUBLED GAZE THAT DWELT UPON HIS SISTER AND THIS WEIRDLY EXQUISITE WOMAN WHO HELD HER WAIT EXCLAIMED DRAKE WAIT HELL THE DAMNED WITCH IS STEALING HER AWAY FROM US
3486-166446-0024 AGAIN HE THREW HIMSELF FORWARD RECOILED AS THOUGH SWEPT BACK BY AN INVISIBLE ARM FELL AGAINST US AND WAS CLASPED AND HELD BY VENTNOR AND AS HE STRUGGLED THE THING WE RODE HALTED
3486-166446-0025 LIKE METAL WAVES BACK INTO IT RUSHED THE ENIGMATIC BILLOWS THAT HAD WASHED OVER THE FRAGMENTS OF THE CITY WE WERE LIFTED BETWEEN US AND THE WOMAN AND GIRL A CLEFT APPEARED IT WIDENED INTO A RIFT
3486-166446-0026 IT WAS AS THOUGH NORHALA HAD DECREED IT AS A SYMBOL OF THIS HER SECOND VICTORY OR HAD SET IT BETWEEN US AS A BARRIER WIDER GREW THE RIFT
3486-166446-0027 SAVE FOR THE BRIDGE OF OUR VOICES IT SEPARATED US FROM RUTH AS THOUGH SHE STOOD UPON ANOTHER WORLD HIGHER WE ROSE THE THREE OF US NOW UPON THE FLAT TOP OF A TOWER UPON WHOSE COUNTERPART FIFTY FEET AWAY
3486-166446-0028 QUIETLY IT GLIDED TO THE CHASM IT HAD BLASTED IN THE CLIFF WALL THE SHADOW OF THOSE WALLS FELL UPON US AS ONE WE LOOKED BACK AS ONE WE SEARCHED OUT THE PATCH OF BLUE WITH THE BLACK BLOT AT ITS BREAST WE FOUND IT THEN THE PRECIPICES HID IT
3486-166446-0029 SILENTLY WE STREAMED THROUGH THE CHASM THROUGH THE CANYON AND THE TUNNEL SPEAKING NO WORD DRAKE'S EYES FIXED WITH BITTER HATRED UPON NORHALA VENTNOR BROODING UPON HER ALWAYS WITH THAT ENIGMATIC SYMPATHY WE PASSED BETWEEN THE WALLS OF THE FURTHER CLEFT
3486-166446-0030 STOOD FOR AN INSTANT AT THE BRINK OF THE GREEN FOREST THERE CAME TO US AS THOUGH FROM IMMEASURABLE DISTANCES A FAINT SUSTAINED THRUMMING LIKE THE BEATING OF COUNTLESS MUFFLED DRUMS THE THING THAT CARRIED US TREMBLED THE SOUND DIED AWAY
3486-166446-0031 THE THING QUIETED IT BEGAN ITS STEADY EFFORTLESS STRIDING THROUGH THE CROWDING TREES BUT NOW WITH NONE OF THAT SPEED WITH WHICH IT HAD COME SPURRED FORWARD BY NORHALA'S AWAKENED HATE VENTNOR STIRRED
3486-166446-0032 PURGED NOT ONLY BY SUFFERING BUT BY IT CAME TO ME SOME STRANGE KNOWLEDGE NO USE DRAKE HE SAID DREAMILY
3486-166446-0033 BUT THIS I DO KNOW ONLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER CAN THE BALANCE FALL AND IF IT BE ONE WAY THEN YOU AND WE SHALL HAVE RUTH BACK AND IF IT FALLS THE OTHER WAY THEN THERE WILL BE LITTLE NEED FOR US TO CARE FOR MAN WILL BE DONE MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN
3486-166446-0034 IT IS THE CRISIS HE ANSWERED WE CAN DO NOTHING GOODWIN NOTHING WHATEVER IS TO BE STEPS FORTH NOW FROM THE WOMB OF DESTINY AGAIN THERE CAME THAT DISTANT ROLLING LOUDER NOW AGAIN THE THING TREMBLED
3486-166446-0035 IS IT TAPS FOR THEM THE DRUMMING DIED AS I LISTENED FEARFULLY ABOUT US WAS ONLY THE SWISHING THE SIGHING OF THE FALLING TREES BENEATH THE TREAD OF THE THING MOTIONLESS STOOD NORHALA
3486-166446-0036 AND AS MOTIONLESS RUTH MARTIN I CRIED ONCE MORE A DREADFUL DOUBT UPON ME MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHENCE DID THEY COME HIS VOICE WAS CLEAR AND CALM THE EYES BENEATH
3486-166446-0037 THESE CREATURES THAT WHEN MANY STILL ARE ONE THAT WHEN ONE STILL ARE MANY WHENCE DID THEY COME WHAT ARE THEY HE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE CUBES THAT HELD US THEIR HOSTS OF TINY EYES SHONE UP AT HIM ENIGMATICALLY
3486-166446-0038 AS THOUGH THEY HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD I DO NOT FORGET HE SAID AT LEAST NOT ALL DO I FORGET OF WHAT I SAW DURING THAT TIME WHEN I SEEMED AN ATOM OUTSIDE SPACE
3486-166446-0039 AS I TOLD YOU OR THINK I TOLD YOU SPEAKING WITH UNTHINKABLE EFFORT THROUGH LIPS THAT SEEMED ETERNITIES AWAY FROM ME THE ATOM WHO STROVE TO OPEN THEM
3486-166446-0040 REVELATIONS I KNOW NOT WHAT TO CALL THEM AND THOUGH EACH SEEMED EQUALLY REAL OF TWO OF THEM ONLY ONE I THINK CAN BE TRUE AND OF THE THIRD THAT MAY SOME TIME BE TRUE BUT SURELY IS NOT YET THROUGH THE AIR CAME A LOUDER DRUM ROLL
3486-166446-0041 IN IT SOMETHING OMINOUS SOMETHING SINISTER IT SWELLED TO A CRESCENDO ABRUPTLY CEASED AND NOW I SAW NORHALA RAISE HER HEAD LISTEN I SAW A WORLD A VAST WORLD GOODWIN MARCHING STATELY THROUGH SPACE
3486-166446-0042 IT WAS NO GLOBE IT WAS A WORLD OF MANY FACETS OF SMOOTH AND POLISHED PLANES
3486-166446-0043 A GEOMETRIC THOUGHT OF THE GREAT CAUSE OF GOD IF YOU WILL MADE MATERIAL IT WAS AIRLESS WATERLESS SUNLESS
3830-12529-0000 A BEAUTIFUL PEBBLY BEACH EXTENDED ALMOST TO THE WATER'S EDGE EVEN AT LOW TIDE THERE WAS A GRASSY LEVEL SPIT A BACKGROUND OF EVERGREEN GIANT FIR TIMBER
3830-12529-0001 AND SUCH FUEL FOR THE CAMP FIRE BROKEN LIMBS WITH JUST ENOUGH PITCH TO MAKE A CHEERFUL BLAZE AND YET BODY ENOUGH TO LAST WELL
3830-12529-0002 GLAD THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED OLIVER WAS THE CARPENTER OF THE PARTY THE TENT BUILDER WOOD GETTER AND GENERAL ROUSTABOUT WHILE I THE JUNIOR WAS CHIEF COOK AND BOTTLE WASHER
3830-12529-0003 AN ENCAMPMENT OF INDIANS BEING NEAR A PARTY OF THEM SOON VISITED OUR CAMP AND BEGAN MAKING SIGNS FOR TRADE
3830-12529-0004 SAID ONE OF THE MATRONS OF THE PARTY WHAT DOES SHE SAY OLIVER I'M BLESSED IF I KNOW BUT IT LOOKS AS IF SHE WANTED TO SELL SOME CLAMS AFTER CONSIDERABLE DICKERING WITH SIGNS AND GESTURES AND WORDS MANY TIMES REPEATED
3830-12529-0005 WE WERE ABLE TO IMPART THE INFORMATION THAT WE WANTED
3830-12530-0000 SOON WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A FLEET OF SEVEN VESSELS LYING AT ANCHOR IN A LARGE BAY SEVERAL MILES IN EXTENT THE SIGHT OF THOSE SEVEN VESSELS LYING IN THE OFFING MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION UPON OUR MINDS
3830-12530-0001 WE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SO MANY SHIPS AT ONE PLACE CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AMONG THEM WAS THE GOOD BARK MARY MELVILLE WITH HER GRUFF MATE AND BIG HEARTED MASTER CAPTAIN BARSTON
3830-12530-0002 UPON THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE SHORES OF THIS BAY LAY THE TWO TOWNS PORT STEILACOOM AND STEILACOOM CITY BOTH ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE A FAR LARGER TRADE CENTERED HERE THAN AT ANY OTHER POINT ON PUGET SOUND
3830-12530-0003 AND WE DECIDED ON A HALT TO MAKE OURSELVES ACQUAINTED WITH THE SURROUNDINGS A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE SHORE WE FOUND ALSO FORT STEILACOOM IT WAS SIMPLY THE CAMP OF A COMPANY OF UNITED STATES SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN WOODEN SHELLS OF HOUSES
3830-12530-0004 AND LOG CABINS INTENSE RIVALRY RAN BETWEEN THE TWO TOWNS UPPER AND LOWER STEILACOOM AT THIS TIME AS A RESULT THINGS WERE BOOMING
3830-12530-0005 WE WERE SORELY TEMPTED TO ACCEPT THE FLATTERING OFFER OF FOUR DOLLARS A DAY FOR COMMON LABOR IN A TIMBER CAMP BUT CONCLUDED NOT TO BE SWERVED FROM THE SEARCH FOR A NEW HOMESITE DURING THIS VISIT WE BEGAN SEEING INDIANS IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS
3830-12530-0006 THEY SEEMED TO BE A LISTLESS LOT WITH NO THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE OR EVEN FOR THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT THE INDIANS IN THOSE DAYS SEEMED TO WORK OR PLAY BY SPURTS AND SPELLS HERE AND THERE WE SAW A FAMILY
3830-12530-0007 BUT AS A CLASS THEY SEEMED TO ME THE LAZIEST SET OF PEOPLE ON EARTH THAT OPINION WAS MATERIALLY MODIFIED LATER AS I BECAME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR HABITS I HAVE FOUND JUST AS INDUSTRIOUS PEOPLE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
3830-12530-0008 AMONG THE INDIANS AS AMONG THE WHITES THE WORKERS IT MAY BE SAID ARE LESS NUMEROUS AMONG THE MEN THE WOMEN ARE ALL INDUSTRIOUS SHOULD WE CAMP HERE AND SPY OUT THE LAND OR SHOULD WE GO FORWARD AND SEE WHAT LAY BEFORE US
3830-12530-0009 AFTER A SOBER SECOND THOUGHT WE REALIZED THAT WE HAD NOTHING TO TRADE BUT LABOR AND WE HAD NOT COME AS FAR AS THIS TO BE LABORERS FOR HIRE WE HAD COME TO FIND A PLACE TO MAKE A FARM
3830-12530-0010 AND A FARM WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AGAIN WE SET ABOUT SEARCHING FOR CLAIMS AND THE MORE WE SEARCHED THE LESS WE LIKED THE LOOK OF THINGS FINALLY ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER A LONG WEARISOME TRAMP WE CAST OFF AT HIGH TIDE
3830-12530-0011 AND IN A DEAD CALM TO CONTINUE OUR CRUISE OLIVER SOON DROPPED INTO A COMFORTABLE AFTERNOON NAP LEAVING ME IN FULL COMMAND AS THE SUN SHONE WARM AND THE TIDE WAS TAKING US RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION WE WANTED TO GO
3830-12530-0012 WHY SHOULDN'T I DOZE A LITTLE TOO EVEN IF WE DID MISS SOME OF THE SIGHTSEEING I WAS AROUSED FROM MY NAP BY OLIVER'S EXCLAIMING WHAT IS THAT THEN HALF TO HIMSELF AS I LIVE IT'S A DEER SWIMMING OUT HERE IN THE BAY
3830-12530-0013 IT SURELY CAN'T BE I RESPONDED THREE QUARTERS ASLEEP THAT'S WHAT IT IS HE ASSERTED WE WERE WIDE AWAKE NOW AND GAVE CHASE VERY SOON WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE ANIMAL AND SUCCEEDED IN THROWING A ROPE OVER ITS HORNS
3830-12530-0014 BY THIS TIME WE HAD DRIFTED INTO THE NARROWS AND WE SOON FOUND WE HAD SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAN TO TOW A DEER
3830-12530-0015 A PERPENDICULAR BLUFF ROSE FROM THE HIGHWATER MARK LEAVING NO PLACE FOR CAMP FIRE OR BED
3830-12530-0016 AND WITH CONTENDING FORCES OF CURRENTS AND COUNTER CURRENTS YET ALL MOVING IN A GENERAL DIRECTION IT WAS OUR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO A GENUINE TIDE RIP THE WATERS BOILED AS IF IN A VERITABLE CALDRON SWELLING UP HERE AND THERE
3830-12530-0017 GIVE ME THE SALMON CAUGHT BY TROLLING IN EARLY SUMMER IN THE DEEP WATERS OF PUGET SOUND THE FISH SO FAT THAT THE EXCESS OF OIL MUST BE TURNED OUT OF THE PAN WHILE COOKING
3830-12530-0018 THE FOLLOWING DAY WE COULD SEE MT RAINIER WITH ITS REFLECTION IN THE PLACID WATERS OF THE BAY THEODORE WINTHROP THE OBSERVANT TRAVELER WHO CAME INTO THESE SAME WATERS A FEW MONTHS LATER AND WROTE OF IT AS MT TACOMA
3830-12530-0019 DESCRIBED IT AS A GIANT MOUNTAIN DOME OF SNOW SEEMING TO FILL THE AERIAL SPACES AS THE IMAGE DISPLACED THE BLUE DEEPS OF TRANQUIL WATER A WONDROUS SIGHT IT WAS AND IS WHATEVER THE NAME NEXT DAY WE ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE PUYALLUP
3830-12530-0020 AND THAT THE CURRENT WAS VERY STRONG WE SECURED THE SERVICES OF AN INDIAN AND HIS CANOE TO HELP US UP THE RIVER AND LEFT OUR BOAT AT THE INDIANS CAMP NEAR THE MOUTH IT TOOK A TUGGING OF TWO DAYS TO GO SIX MILES
3830-12530-0021 AND DRAG OUR CANOE AROUND THE DRIFTS IT WAS A STORY OF CONSTANT TOIL WITH CONSEQUENT DISCOURAGEMENT NOT ENDING UNTIL WE CAMPED
3830-12530-0022 AN INDIAN TRAIL LED UP THE RIVER FROM
3830-12530-0023 BUT WAGON ROADS THERE WERE NONE AND WHETHER A FEASIBLE ROUTE FOR ONE COULD BE FOUND ONLY TIME AND LABOR COULD DETERMINE WE RETRACED OUR STEPS AND IN THE EVENING LANDED AGAIN AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AFTER A SEVERE DAY'S TOIL WE WERE IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD
3830-12530-0024 OLIVER DID NOT SING AS USUAL WHILE PREPARING FOR CAMP NEITHER DID I HAVE MUCH TO SAY BUT I FELL TO WORK MECHANICALLY PREPARING THE MUCH NEEDED MEAL WE ATE IN SILENCE AND THEN WENT TO SLEEP
3830-12530-0025 OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES OF UNOCCUPIED PRAIRIE LAND AS RICH AS ANYTHING THAT EVER LAY OUT OF DOORS ON OUR WAY FROM INDIANA TO OREGON IN SEARCH OF LAND ON WHICH TO MAKE A HOME HERE AT WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE END OF OUR ROPE
3830-12530-0026 WE HAD FOUND THE LAND BUT WITH CONDITIONS THAT SEEMED ALMOST TOO ADVERSE TO OVERCOME IT WAS A DISCOURAGING OUTLOOK EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ROADS SUCH TIMBER IT SEEMED AN APPALLING UNDERTAKING TO CLEAR THIS LAND
3830-12530-0027 WHEN WE FELL ASLEEP THAT NIGHT IT WAS WITHOUT VISIONS OF NEW FOUND WEALTH AND YET LATER I DID TACKLE A QUARTER SECTION OF THAT HEAVIEST TIMBER LAND AND NEVER LET UP UNTIL THE LAST TREE LOG STUMP AND ROOT HAD DISAPPEARED
3830-12530-0028 THOUGH OF COURSE NOT ALL CLEARED OFF BY MY OWN HANDS IF WE COULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS COMING FOUR MONTHS LATER WE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN SPITE OF OUR DISCOURAGEMENT
3830-12530-0029 PASS TRAIL INTO WASHINGTON THEY LOCATED IN A BODY OVER NEARLY THE WHOLE VALLEY AND BEFORE THE YEAR WAS ENDED HAD MADE A ROUGH WAGON ROAD OUT TO THE PRAIRIES
3830-12530-0030 LEST SOME SMART FELLOW SHOULD UP AND SAY I WAS DRAWING ON MY IMAGINATION I AM NOT WHEN WE HAD BROKEN CAMP AND WERE SAILING ALONG WE HEARD A DULL SOUND LIKE THAT OFTEN HEARD
3830-12530-0031 IT EXTENDED AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE IN THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING THE SOUND INCREASED AND BECAME LIKE THE ROAR OF A HEAVY FALL OF RAIN OR HAIL ON WATER AND WE BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS A VAST SCHOOL OF FISH MOVING SOUTH
3830-12530-0032 WHILE MILLIONS WERE SEEMINGLY DANCING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER OR LEAPING IN THE AIR WE COULD FEEL THE FISH STRIKING AGAINST THE BOAT IN SUCH VAST NUMBERS THAT THEY FAIRLY MOVED IT THE LEAP IN THE AIR WAS SO HIGH
3830-12530-0033 ONE WOULD DROP INTO THE BOAT WE SOON DISCOVERED SOME INDIANS FOLLOWING THE SCHOOL
3830-12530-0034 WITH AN IMPROVISED NET WE TOO SOON OBTAINED ALL WE WANTED WHEN WE BEGAN TO GO ON WE WERE EMBARRASSED BY THE MASS OF FISH MOVING IN THE WATER AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO END TO THE SCHOOL AHEAD OF US BUT WE FINALLY GOT CLEAR OF THE MOVING MASS
3830-12530-0035 AND REACHED THE ISLAND SHORE IN SAFETY ONLY TO BECOME WEATHER BOUND IN THE WILDS ONCE MORE THIS CAMP DID NOT PROVE SO DREARY AS THE LAST ONE ALTHOUGH IT WAS MORE EXPOSED TO THE SWELL OF THE BIG WATERS
3830-12530-0036 AND THE SWEEP OF THE WIND TO THE NORTH WE HAD A VIEW OF THIRTY MILES OR MORE TO WHERE HORIZON AND WATER BLENDED LEAVING IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER LAND WAS IN SIGHT OR NOT AS WE AFTERWARDS ASCERTAINED WE COULD SEE THE FAMOUS SAN JUAN ISLAND
3830-12530-0037 LATER THE BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AND GREAT BRITAIN WHEN THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS SETTLED PORT TOWNSEND LAY
3830-12530-0038 THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE TOWN LIKE THE LOST HUNTERS WE KNEW WHERE WE WERE BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ANY PLACE ELSE WAS NOT LOST OURSELVES THE WORLD WAS LOST FROM US THREE SHIPS PASSED US WHILE WE WERE AT THIS CAMP
3830-12530-0039 A MERE SPECK AND GROWING TO A FULL FLEDGED DEEP SEA VESSEL WITH ALL SAILS SET SCUDDING BEFORE THE WIND THE OTHER TWO WERE GRACEFULLY BEATING THEIR WAY OUT
3830-12530-0040 WITH THE BEAUTIFUL OPEN AND COMPARATIVELY LEVEL PLATEAU IN THE BACKGROUND AND TWO OR THREE VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN THE FOREGROUND MADE A PICTURE OF A PERFECT CITY SITE
3830-12530-0041 MANY SHACKS AND CAMPS AT FIRST MISTAKEN FOR THE WHITE MEN'S HOUSES WERE FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY NATIVES THEY WERE A DRUNKEN RASCALLY RABBLE SPENDING THEIR GAINS FROM THE SALE OF FISH AND OIL
3830-12530-0042 IN A DEBAUCH THAT WOULD LAST AS LONG AS THEIR MONEY HELD OUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A MORE STALWART RACE OF INDIANS THAN THOSE TO THE SOUTH DOUBTLESS FROM THE BUFFETING RECEIVED IN THE LARGER WATERS THEY WOULD OFTEN GO OUT EVEN TO THE OPEN SEA
3830-12530-0043 ON THEIR FISHING EXCURSIONS IN CANOES MANNED BY THIRTY MEN OR MORE AFTER SPENDING TWO OR THREE DAYS EXPLORING THE COUNTRY WE TURNED BACK TO THE BAY WHERE LAY THE SEVEN SHIPS WE HAD SEEN NEAR STEILACOOM WE REMEMBERED THE TIMBER CAMPS
3830-12530-0044 THE BUSTLE AND STIR OF THE LITTLE NEW VILLAGE AND THE ACTIVITY THAT WE SAW THERE GREATER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE WATERS OF THE SOUND MOST OF ALL MY THOUGHTS WOULD GO ON TO THE LITTLE CABIN ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER THREE DAYS SUFFICED TO LAND
3830-12530-0045 US BACK IN THE BAY WE SOUGHT BUT THE SHIPS WERE GONE NOT A SAILING CRAFT OF ANY KIND WAS IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE TOWN
3830-12531-0000 CAN I GET HOME TONIGHT I ASKED MYSELF IT WAS AN AFTERNOON OF THE LAST WEEK OF JUNE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND THE SUN WAS YET HIGH I WAS WELL UP THE LEFT BANK OF THE COWLITZ RIVER HOW FAR I COULD NOT TELL
3830-12531-0001 FOR THERE WERE NO MILESTONES ON THE CROOKED HALF OBSTRUCTED TRAIL LEADING DOWNSTREAM AT BEST IT WOULD BE A RACE WITH THE SUN BUT THE DAYS WERE LONG AND THE TWILIGHT WAS LONG
3830-12531-0002 I WORE A HEAVY WOOLEN SHIRT A SLOUCH HAT AND WORN SHOES BOTH HAT AND SHOES GAVE AMPLE VENTILATION SOCKS I HAD NONE NEITHER HAD I SUSPENDERS AN IMPROVISED BELT
3830-12531-0003 TAKING THEIR PLACE I WAS DRESSED FOR THE RACE AND WAS EAGER FOR THE TRIAL AT OLYMPIA I HAD PARTED WITH MY BROTHER
3830-12531-0004 WHILE I WAS TO GO HOME FOR THE WIFE AND BABY TO REMOVE THEM TO OUR NEW HOME I DID NOT PARTICULARLY MIND THE CAMPING BUT I DID NOT FANCY THE IDEA OF LYING OUT SO NEAR HOME IF BY EXTRA EXERTION I COULD REACH THE CABIN BEFORE NIGHT
3830-12531-0005 WE NEVER THOUGHT OF CATCHING COLD FROM LYING ON THE GROUND OR ON CEDAR BOUGHS OR FROM GETTING A GOOD DRENCHING AFTER ALL THE CABIN COULD NOT BE REACHED AS THE TRAIL COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED AT NIGHT
3830-12531-0006 SLACKENING PACE AT NIGHTFALL TO COOL MY SYSTEM GRADUALLY I FINALLY MADE MY CAMP AND SLEPT AS SOUNDLY AS IF ON A BED OF DOWN MY CONSOLATION WAS THAT THE NIGHT WAS SHORT AND I COULD SEE TO TRAVEL BY THREE O'CLOCK
3830-12531-0007 I DO NOT LOOK UPON THOSE YEARS OF CAMP AND CABIN LIFE AS YEARS OF HARDSHIP TO BE SURE OUR FOOD WAS PLAIN AS WELL AS OUR DRESS OUR HOURS OF LABOR WERE LONG AND THE LABOR ITSELF WAS FREQUENTLY SEVERE THE PIONEERS APPEARED ROUGH AND UNCOUTH
3830-12531-0008 WE NEVER WATCHED FOR THE SUN TO GO DOWN
3830-12531-0009 OR FOR THE BOSS TO QUICKEN OUR STEPS THE DAYS WERE ALWAYS TOO SHORT AND INTEREST IN OUR WORK WAS ALWAYS UNABATED THE CABIN COULD NOT BE SEEN UNTIL THE TRAIL CAME QUITE NEAR IT WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CURL OF SMOKE I KNEW I WAS ALMOST THERE THEN I SAW THE CABIN
3830-12531-0010 AND A LITTLE LADY IN ALMOST BLOOMER DRESS MILKING THE COW SHE NEVER FINISHED MILKING THAT COW NOR DID SHE EVER MILK ANY COW WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS AT HOME THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE COULD SCARCELY TELL WHERE TO BEGIN OR WHEN TO STOP
3830-12531-0011 MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY CENTERED ON THE QUESTION OF OUR MOVING TO A NEW HOME WHY AT OLYMPIA EGGS WERE A DOLLAR A DOZEN I SAW THEM SELLING AT THAT THE BUTTER YOU HAVE THERE WOULD BRING YOU A DOLLAR A POUND AS FAST AS YOU COULD WEIGH IT OUT
3830-12531-0012 I SAW STUFF THEY CALLED BUTTER SELL FOR THAT POTATOES ARE SELLING FOR THREE DOLLARS A BUSHEL AND ONIONS AT FOUR EVERYTHING THE FARMER RAISES SELLS HIGH WHO BUYS OH ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS TO BUY
3830-12531-0013 WHERE DO THEY GET THE MONEY EVERYBODY SEEMS TO HAVE MONEY SOME TAKE IT THERE WITH THEM MEN WORKING IN THE TIMBER CAMPS GET FOUR DOLLARS A DAY AND THEIR BOARD AT ONE PLACE THEY PAID FOUR DOLLARS A CORD FOR WOOD TO SHIP TO SAN FRANCISCO
3830-12531-0014 AND A MAN CAN SELL ALL THE SHINGLES HE CAN MAKE AT FOUR DOLLARS A THOUSAND I WAS OFFERED FIVE CENTS A FOOT FOR PILES IF WE HAD BUCK AND DANDY OVER THERE WE COULD MAKE TWENTY DOLLARS A DAY
3830-12531-0015 OFF THE GOVERNMENT LAND OF COURSE ALL HELP THEMSELVES TO WHAT THEY WANT THEN THERE ARE THE FISH AND THE CLAMS AND OYSTERS AND BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LAND FOR THE CLAIM THAT QUESTION WAS A STUMPER THE LITTLE WIFE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT BARGAIN MADE BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED
3830-12531-0016 NOW I FOUND MYSELF PRAISING A COUNTRY FOR THE AGRICULTURAL QUALITIES OF WHICH I COULD NOT SAY MUCH BUT IF WE COULD SELL PRODUCE HIGHER MIGHT WE NOT WELL LOWER OUR STANDARD OF AN IDEAL FARM THE CLAIM I HAD TAKEN WAS DESCRIBED WITH A TOUCH OF APOLOGY
3830-12531-0017 HOWEVER WE DECIDED TO MOVE AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR THE JOURNEY THE WIFE BABY BEDDING OX YOKE AND LOG CHAIN WERE SENT UP THE COWLITZ IN A CANOE BUCK AND DANDY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0018 ON THIS OCCASION I WAS ILL PREPARED FOR A COOL NIGHT CAMP HAVING NEITHER BLANKET NOR COAT I HAD EXPECTED TO REACH HARD BREAD'S HOTEL WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE CANOE WOULD STOP OVERNIGHT BUT I COULD NOT MAKE IT SO AGAIN I LAY OUT ON THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0019 HARD BREAD'S AN ODD NAME FOR A HOTEL WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE THE OLD WIDOWER THAT KEPT THE PLACE FED HIS PATRONS ON HARDTACK THREE TIMES A DAY I FOUND THAT MY WIFE HAD NOT FARED ANY BETTER THAN I HAD ON THE TRAIL AND IN FACT
3830-12531-0020 NOT SO WELL THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN THAT IS THE HOTEL WAS A GREAT DEAL HARDER THAN THE SAND SPIT WHERE I HAD PASSED THE NIGHT I HAD PLENTY OF PURE FRESH AIR WHILE SHE IN A CLOSED CABIN
3830-12531-0021 AND IN THE SAME ROOM WITH MANY OTHERS HAD NEITHER FRESH AIR NOR FREEDOM FROM CREEPING THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE MISERABLE WITH HER SHOES FOR A PILLOW A SHAWL FOR COVERING SMALL WONDER THAT SHE REPORTED I DID NOT SLEEP A WINK LAST NIGHT
3830-12531-0022 WE SOON ARRIVED AT THE COWLITZ LANDING THE END OF THE CANOE JOURNEY STRIKING THE TENT THAT HAD SERVED US SO WELL ON THE PLAINS AND MAKING A CHEERFUL CAMP FIRE WE SPEEDILY FORGOT THE HARD EXPERIENCES OF THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0023 FIFTY MILES MORE OF TRAVEL LAY BEFORE US AND SUCH A ROAD HOWEVER WE HAD ONE CONSOLATION IT WOULD BE WORSE IN WINTER THAN AT THAT TIME
3830-12531-0024 OUR COWS WERE GONE GIVEN FOR PROVENDER TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE OXEN DURING THE DEEP DECEMBER SNOW SO WHEN WE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK WE HAD THE BABY BUCK AND DANDY A TENT AN OX YOKE AND CHAIN ENOUGH CLOTHING AND BEDDING TO KEEP US COMFORTABLE
3830-12531-0025 A VERY LITTLE FOOD AND NO MONEY THE MONEY HAD ALL BEEN EXPENDED ON THE CANOE PASSAGE SHOULD WE PACK THE OXEN AND WALK
3830-12531-0026 THIS LAST PROPOSITION WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE AND SO NEXT MORNING DRIVING MY OXEN BEFORE ME AND LEAVING WIFE AND BABY TO TAKE CARE OF THE CAMP
3830-12531-0027 STRANGER THOUGH I WAS TO SAY YES YOU CAN HAVE TWO IF YOU NEED THEM JACKSON HAD SETTLED THERE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE
3830-12531-0028 THE DREAD DISEASE HAD TERRORS THEN THAT IT DOES NOT NOW POSSESS COULD IT BE POSSIBLE MY FOLKS HAD BEEN TAKEN SICK
3830-12531-0029 IT APPEARED THAT I HAD SCARCELY GOT OUT OF SIGHT ON MY TRIP BACK WITH THE OXEN BEFORE ONE OF THOSE ROYAL PIONEER MATRONS HAD COME TO THE CAMP SHE PLEADED AND INSISTED AND FINALLY ALMOST FRIGHTENED THE LITTLE WIFE INTO GOING WITH HER
3830-12531-0030 AND SHARING HER HOUSE WHICH WAS NEAR BY
3830-12531-0031 FINDING THAT THE BOAT AND PROVISIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN AND SEEING SMOKE IN THE BIGHT
3830-12535-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FINDING MY PEOPLE ON LEAVING MY NEWLY FOUND FRIENDS I FACED A DISCOURAGING PROSPECT THE START FOR THE HIGH ARID TABLE LANDS BORDERING THE YAKIMA VALLEY CUT ME LOOSE FROM ALL COMMUNICATION
3830-12535-0001 NO MORE IMMIGRANTS WERE MET UNTIL I REACHED THE MAIN TRAVELED ROUTE BEYOND THE COLUMBIA RIVER THE ROAD LAY THROUGH A FORBIDDING SAGE PLAIN OR RATHER AN UNDULATING COUNTRY COVERED BY SHIFTING SANDS
3830-12535-0002 AS THE SUN ROSE THE HEAT BECAME INTOLERABLE THE DUST IN PLACES BROUGHT VIVID MEMORIES OF THE TRIP ACROSS THE PLAINS
3830-12535-0003 TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE EXPECTED TRAIN
3830-12535-0004 AND COMPELLED ME TO LEAVE THE ROAD AND DESCEND INTO THE VALLEY FOR WATER
3830-12535-0005 THAT LASTED UNTIL DURING THE AFTERNOON WHEN I FOUND WATER ON THE TRAIL TETHERING MY PONY FOR HIS MUCH NEEDED DINNER I OPENED MY SACK OF HARD BREAD TO COUNT THE CONTENTS MY STORE WAS HALF GONE I LAY DOWN IN THE SHADE OF A SMALL TREE
3830-12535-0006 NEAR THE SPRING TO TAKE AN AFTERNOON NAP ROUSING BEFORE SUNDOWN REFRESHED BOBBY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL WITH NEW COURAGE WHEN NIGHT CAME I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO CAMP THE COOL OF THE EVENING INVIGORATED THE PONY AND WE PUSHED ON
3830-12535-0007 FINDING THAT THE ROAD COULD BE FOLLOWED THOUGH BUT DIMLY SEEN I KEPT ON THE TRAIL UNTIL A LATE HOUR WHEN I UNSADDLED AND HOBBLED THE PONY THE SADDLE BLANKET WAS BROUGHT INTO USE AND I WAS SOON OFF IN DREAMLAND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE DUST THE TRAIL OR THE MORROW
3830-12535-0008 TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HIS HOBBLES HAD BECOME LOOSENED GIVING HIM FREE USE OF ALL HIS FEET AND HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO TAKE THE TRAIL AGAIN COAXING WAS OF NO AVAIL DRIVING WOULD DO NO GOOD
3830-12535-0009 I FOLLOWED HIM AROUND ABOUT OVER THE PLAIN AND THROUGH THE SAGE BRUSH AT A RAPID GAIT FINALLY HE SLACKENED PACE AND I AGAIN BECAME MASTER
3830-12535-0010 ALL THIS ROAMING OVER THE PLAIN AT BOBBY'S HEELS BUT I HAPPENED TO TAKE THE RIGHT COURSE WHEN THE TRAIL WAS FOUND THERE WAS THE SADDLE TO LOOK FOR AND THIS WAS LOCATED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
3830-12535-0011 A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF TRAVEL BROUGHT UNEASINESS AS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE NOT ON THE REGULAR TRAIL NOT KNOWING BUT THIS WAS SOME CUT OFF I WENT ON UNTIL THE COLUMBIA RIVER BLUFF WAS REACHED AND THE GREAT RIVER WAS IN SIGHT
3830-12535-0012 HALF A MILE DISTANT AND SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET LOWER TAKING A TRAIL DOWN THE BLUFF THAT SEEMED MORE PROMISING THAN THE WAGON TRACKS I BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR THE ROAD AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF
3830-12535-0013 ONLY TO FIND EVERY SEMBLANCE OF A ROAD GONE I LOST MORE THAN A HALF DAY'S PRECIOUS TIME AND AGAIN WAS THROWN INTO ANXIETY LEST I HAD MISSED THE LONG SOUGHT TRAIN THE NEXT INCIDENT THAT I REMEMBER VIVIDLY WAS MY ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE COLUMBIA
3830-12535-0014 JUST BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE SNAKE RIVER I HAD SEEN BUT FEW INDIANS ON THE WHOLE TRIP AND IN FACT THE CAMP I FOUND THERE ON THE BANK OF THE GREAT RIVER WAS THE FIRST I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER COMING UPON I COULD NOT INDUCE THE INDIANS TO CROSS ME OVER
3830-12535-0015 THEY SEEMED SURLY AND UNFRIENDLY THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS SO IN CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE INDIANS ON THE SOUND THAT I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT IT MEANT NO ONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE LOST HIS LIFE AT THE HANDS OF THE INDIANS THAT SEASON
3830-12535-0016 UNTIL I WAS HOARSE FROM THE VIOLENT EFFORT FINALLY WHILE SITTING THERE WONDERING WHAT TO DO I SPIED A BLUE SMOKE ARISING FROM A CABIN ON THE OTHER SIDE SOON AFTER I SAW A MAN HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO MY RENEWED EFFORTS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
3830-12535-0017 THE TROUBLE HAD BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ALL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY MORNING EXPENDING MY BREATH FOR NOTHING THE MAN WAS SHIRLEY ENSIGN OF OLYMPIA WHO HAD ESTABLISHED A FERRY ACROSS THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND HAD LINGERED TO SET OVER BELATED IMMIGRANTS IF ANY SHOULD COME ALONG
3830-12535-0018 AND HAD MET MY PEOPLE THEY WERE CAMPED SOME THIRTY MILES AWAY HE THOUGHT
3830-12535-0019 BUT I COULD NOT WAIT THERE FOR THEM
3830-12535-0020 DETERMINED TO REACH CAMP THAT NIGHT IF I COULD POSSIBLY DO SO
3830-12535-0021 DUSK CAME ON AND STILL NO SIGNS THEN I SPIED SOME CATTLE GRAZING ON THE UPLAND AND SOON CAME UPON THE CAMP IN A RAVINE THAT HAD SHUT IT FROM VIEW REJOICING AND OUTBURSTS OF GRIEF FOLLOWED I INQUIRED FOR MY MOTHER THE FIRST THING
3830-12535-0022 SHE WAS NOT THERE MONTHS BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE SANDS OF THE PLATTE VALLEY MY YOUNGER BROTHER ALSO LAY BURIED ON THE PLAINS NEAR INDEPENDENCE ROCK
3830-12535-0023 WHEN WE CAME TO CONSIDER HOW THE PARTY SHOULD PROCEED I ADVISED THE OVER MOUNTAIN TRIP BUT I CAUTIONED THEM TO EXPECT SOME SNOW AND MUCH HARD WORK HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE THEY ASKED ABOUT THREE WEEKS THIS BROUGHT DISAPPOINTMENT
3830-12535-0024 THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THROUGH WITH THE JOURNEY YOU CAME TO STAY WITH US DIDN'T YOU I WANT TO BUT WHAT ABOUT MY WIFE AND THE TWO BABIES AT THE ISLAND FATHER SAID SOME ONE MUST GO AND LOOK AFTER THEM SO OLIVER WAS SENT AHEAD
3830-12535-0025 WHILE I WAS TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND HELP THE IMMIGRANTS THROUGH THE NATCHESS PASS IN OUR TRAIN WERE FIFTY OR MORE HEAD OF STOCK SEVEN WAGONS AND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE WE MADE THE TRIP ACROSS THE DIVIDE IN TWENTY TWO DAYS WITHOUT SERIOUS MISHAP OR LOSS
3830-12535-0026 THAT BESET OUR WAY AT EVERY STEP EVERY MAN LITERALLY PUT HIS SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL WE WERE COMPELLED OFTEN TO TAKE HOLD OF THE WHEELS TO BOOST THE WAGONS OVER THE LOGS OR TO EASE THEM DOWN STEEP PLACES
3830-12535-0027 ONE MAN TO EACH WAGON TO DRIVE FOUR TO ACT AS WHEELMEN FATHER AND THE WOMEN ON FOOT OR HORSEBACK TO DRIVE THE STOCK GOD BLESS THE WOMEN FOLKS OF THE PLAINS NOBLER BRAVER MORE UNCOMPLAINING SOULS WERE NEVER KNOWN
3830-12535-0028 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME ONE OUGHT TO WRITE A JUST TRIBUTE TO THEIR VALOR AND PATIENCE A BOOK OF THEIR HEROIC DEEDS ONE DAY WE ENCOUNTERED A NEWLY FALLEN TREE COCKED UP ON ITS OWN UPTURNED ROOTS FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND GO AROUND IT WE COULD NOT
3830-12535-0029 TO CUT IT OUT WITH OUR DULLED FLIMSY SAW SEEMED AN ENDLESS TASK DIG DOWN BOYS SAID FATHER AND IN SHORT ORDER EVERY AVAILABLE SHOVEL WAS OUT OF THE WAGONS VERY SOON THE WAY WAS OPEN FULLY FOUR FEET DEEP AND OXEN AND WAGONS PASSED UNDER THE OBSTRUCTION
3830-12535-0030 DO YOU SAY THAT WE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIPS THAT DEPENDS UPON THE POINT OF VIEW AS TO THIS RETURN TRIP I CAN TRULY SAY FOR MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT ONE OF HARDSHIP I ENJOYED OVERCOMING THE DIFFICULTIES AND SO DID THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE COMPANY
3830-12535-0031 BUT BETTER FOOD WAS OBTAINABLE AND THE GOAL WAS NEAR AT HAND IT WAS A POSITIVE PLEASURE THEREFORE TO PASS OVER THE MILES ONE BY ONE
3830-12535-0032 WHEN OUR LITTLE TRAIN AT LAST EMERGED FROM THE FORESTS AND CAME OUT INTO THE NISQUALLY PLAINS
3830-12535-0033 SO MARKED WAS THE CONTRAST HUNDREDS OF CATTLE SHEEP AND HORSES WERE QUIETLY GRAZING SCATTERED OVER THE LANDSCAPE AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE
403-126855-0000 THE SEVENTH CHAPTER
403-126855-0001 THE BRIDGE OF APES QUEEN ERMINTRUDE HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE SEEN HER HUSBAND SO TERRIBLE AS HE GOT THAT NIGHT HE GNASHED HIS TEETH WITH RAGE
403-126855-0002 HE CALLED EVERYBODY A FOOL HE THREW HIS TOOTH BRUSH AT THE PALACE CAT HE RUSHED ROUND IN HIS NIGHT SHIRT AND WOKE UP ALL HIS ARMY AND SENT THEM INTO THE JUNGLE TO CATCH THE DOCTOR
403-126855-0003 THEN HE MADE ALL HIS SERVANTS GO TOO HIS COOKS AND HIS GARDENERS AND HIS BARBER AND PRINCE BUMPO'S TUTOR EVEN THE QUEEN WHO WAS TIRED FROM DANCING IN A PAIR OF TIGHT SHOES
403-126855-0004 WAS PACKED OFF TO HELP THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR SEARCH ALL THIS TIME THE DOCTOR AND HIS ANIMALS WERE RUNNING THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARDS THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO GUB GUB
403-126855-0005 WITH HIS SHORT LEGS SOON GOT TIRED AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO CARRY HIM WHICH MADE IT PRETTY HARD WHEN THEY HAD THE TRUNK AND THE HAND BAG WITH THEM AS WELL THE KING OF THE JOLLIGINKI
403-126855-0006 THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR HIS ARMY TO FIND THEM BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WAS IN A STRANGE LAND AND WOULD NOT KNOW HIS WAY BUT HE WAS WRONG BECAUSE THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE KNEW ALL THE PATHS THROUGH THE JUNGLE BETTER EVEN THAN THE KING'S MEN DID
403-126855-0007 AND HE LED THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS TO THE VERY THICKEST PART OF THE FOREST A PLACE WHERE NO MAN HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE AND HID THEM ALL IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE BETWEEN HIGH ROCKS
403-126855-0008 SO THERE THEY STAYED THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH THEY OFTEN HEARD THE KING'S MEN SEARCHING AND TALKING IN THE JUNGLE ROUND ABOUT BUT THEY WERE QUITE SAFE FOR NO ONE KNEW OF THAT HIDING PLACE BUT CHEE CHEE NOT EVEN THE OTHER MONKEYS
403-126855-0009 AT LAST WHEN DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO COME THROUGH THE THICK LEAVES OVERHEAD THEY HEARD QUEEN ERMINTRUDE SAYING IN A VERY TIRED VOICE THAT IT WAS NO USE LOOKING ANY MORE THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AND GET SOME SLEEP
403-126855-0010 AND THEY SET OFF FOR THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS IT WAS A LONG LONG WAY AND THEY OFTEN GOT VERY TIRED ESPECIALLY GUB GUB BUT WHEN HE CRIED THEY GAVE HIM MILK OUT OF THE COCOANUTS
403-126855-0011 CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT THEY EVEN GOT THE DOCTOR SOME TOBACCO ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND WANTED TO SMOKE
403-126855-0012 AND ENJOYED THE LIFE OF TRAVEL VERY MUCH BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS GLAD WHEN THE NIGHT CAME AND THEY STOPPED FOR THEIR RESTING TIME THEN THE DOCTOR USED TO MAKE A LITTLE FIRE OF STICKS
403-126855-0013 THEY WOULD SIT ROUND IT IN A RING LISTENING TO POLYNESIA SINGING SONGS ABOUT THE SEA OR TO CHEE CHEE TELLING STORIES OF THE JUNGLE AND MANY OF THE TALES THAT CHEE CHEE TOLD WERE VERY INTERESTING
403-126855-0014 BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE MONKEYS HAD NO HISTORY BOOKS OF THEIR OWN BEFORE DOCTOR DOLITTLE CAME TO WRITE THEM FOR THEM THEY REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS BY TELLING STORIES TO THEIR CHILDREN
403-126855-0015 OF THE DAYS WHEN MEN DRESSED IN BEAR SKINS AND LIVED IN HOLES IN THE ROCK AND ATE THEIR MUTTON RAW BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT COOKING WAS HAVING NEVER SEEN A FIRE
403-126855-0016 AND HE TOLD THEM OF THE GREAT MAMMOTHS AND LIZARDS AS LONG AS A TRAIN THAT WANDERED OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN THOSE TIMES NIBBLING FROM THE TREE TOPS AND OFTEN THEY GOT SO INTERESTED LISTENING
403-126855-0017 THEY WERE STILL BEING FOLLOWED BY THE KING'S MEN IF CHEE CHEE HAD KNOWN THIS HE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE HIDDEN THEM AGAIN BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW IT ONE DAY CHEE CHEE CLIMBED UP A HIGH ROCK AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE TREE TOPS
403-126855-0018 THESE MONKEYS MADE A TREMENDOUS NOISE CHEERING AND WAVING LEAVES AND SWINGING OUT OF THE BRANCHES TO GREET HIM THEY WANTED TO CARRY HIS BAG AND HIS TRUNK AND EVERYTHING HE HAD AND ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES EVEN CARRIED GUB GUB
403-126855-0019 HAD HEARD THE NOISE OF THE MONKEYS CHEERING AND THEY AT LAST KNEW WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS AND HASTENED ON TO CATCH HIM THE BIG MONKEY CARRYING GUB GUB WAS COMING ALONG BEHIND SLOWLY
403-126855-0020 AND HE SAW THE CAPTAIN OF THE ARMY SNEAKING THROUGH THE TREES SO HE HURRIED AFTER THE DOCTOR AND TOLD HIM TO RUN THEN THEY ALL RAN HARDER THAN THEY HAD EVER RUN IN THEIR LIVES AND THE KING'S MEN
403-126855-0021 COMING AFTER THEM BEGAN TO RUN TOO AND THE CAPTAIN RAN HARDEST OF ALL THEN THE DOCTOR TRIPPED OVER HIS MEDICINE BAG AND FELL DOWN IN THE MUD AND THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT HE WOULD SURELY CATCH HIM THIS TIME
403-126855-0022 BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD VERY LONG EARS THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS VERY SHORT AND AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HOLD OF THE DOCTOR ONE OF HIS EARS CAUGHT FAST IN A TREE
403-126855-0023 BY THIS TIME THE DOCTOR HAD PICKED HIMSELF UP AND ON THEY WENT AGAIN RUNNING AND RUNNING AND CHEE CHEE SHOUTED IT'S ALL RIGHT WE HAVEN'T FAR TO GO NOW
403-126855-0024 BUT BEFORE THEY COULD GET INTO THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS THEY CAME TO A STEEP CLIFF WITH A RIVER FLOWING BELOW THIS WAS THE END OF THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI
403-126855-0025 AND THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE ACROSS THE RIVER AND JIP THE DOG LOOKED DOWN OVER THE EDGE OF THE STEEP STEEP CLIFF AND SAID GOLLY HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET ACROSS
403-126855-0026 OH DEAR SAID GUB GUB THE KING'S MEN ARE QUITE CLOSE NOW LOOK AT THEM I AM AFRAID WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN BACK TO PRISON AGAIN AND HE BEGAN TO WEEP
403-126855-0027 THEY'VE GOT THE CAPTAIN LOOSE AND HE'S COMING ON LIKE A DEER GET LIVELY
403-126855-0028 WAS A BRIDGE ALL READY FOR HIM MADE OF LIVING MONKEYS FOR WHILE HIS BACK WAS TURNED THE MONKEYS QUICK AS A FLASH HAD MADE THEMSELVES INTO A BRIDGE
403-126855-0029 AND THE BIG ONE SHOUTED TO THE DOCTOR WALK OVER WALK OVER ALL OF YOU HURRY GUB GUB WAS A BIT SCARED WALKING ON SUCH A NARROW BRIDGE AT THAT DIZZY HEIGHT
403-126855-0030 AND SO DID ALL OF THEM JOHN DOLITTLE WAS THE LAST TO CROSS AND JUST AS HE WAS GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUSHING UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THEN THEY SHOOK THEIR FISTS AND YELLED WITH RAGE
403-126855-0031 MANY GREAT EXPLORERS AND GRAY BEARDED NATURALISTS HAVE LAIN LONG WEEKS HIDDEN IN THE JUNGLE WAITING TO SEE THE MONKEYS DO THAT TRICK BUT WE NEVER LET A WHITE MAN GET A GLIMPSE OF IT BEFORE YOU ARE THE FIRST TO SEE THE FAMOUS BRIDGE OF APES
403-128339-0000 PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND DETERMINED JURY SAT EVERY DAY THEIR LISTS WENT FORTH EVERY EVENING
403-128339-0001 COME OUT AND LISTEN TO THE EVENING PAPER YOU INSIDE THERE CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY SO AT LAST BEGAN THE EVENING PAPER AT LA FORCE
403-128339-0002 CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY HAD REASON TO KNOW THE USAGE HE HAD SEEN HUNDREDS PASS AWAY SO
403-128339-0003 AND TWO HAD ALREADY BEEN GUILLOTINED AND FORGOTTEN THE LIST WAS READ IN THE VAULTED CHAMBER WHERE DARNAY HAD SEEN THE ASSOCIATED PRISONERS ON THE NIGHT OF HIS ARRIVAL EVERY ONE OF THOSE HAD PERISHED IN THE MASSACRE
403-128339-0004 EVERY HUMAN CREATURE HE HAD SINCE CARED FOR AND PARTED WITH HAD DIED ON THE SCAFFOLD THERE WERE HURRIED WORDS OF FAREWELL AND KINDNESS BUT THE PARTING WAS SOON OVER IT WAS THE INCIDENT OF EVERY DAY
403-128339-0005 AND A LITTLE CONCERT FOR THAT EVENING THEY CROWDED TO THE GRATES AND SHED TEARS THERE BUT TWENTY PLACES IN THE PROJECTED ENTERTAINMENTS HAD TO BE REFILLED AND THE TIME WAS AT BEST SHORT TO THE LOCK UP HOUR
403-128339-0006 WHEN THE COMMON ROOMS AND CORRIDORS WOULD BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE GREAT DOGS WHO KEPT WATCH THERE THROUGH THE NIGHT THE PRISONERS WERE FAR FROM INSENSIBLE OR UNFEELING THEIR WAYS AROSE OUT OF THE CONDITION OF THE TIME SIMILARLY
403-128339-0007 BUT A WILD INFECTION OF THE WILDLY SHAKEN PUBLIC MIND IN SEASONS OF PESTILENCE SOME OF US WILL HAVE A SECRET ATTRACTION TO THE DISEASE A TERRIBLE PASSING INCLINATION TO DIE OF IT
403-128339-0008 AND ALL OF US HAVE LIKE WONDERS HIDDEN IN OUR BREASTS ONLY NEEDING CIRCUMSTANCES TO EVOKE THEM THE PASSAGE TO THE CONCIERGERIE WAS SHORT AND DARK
403-128339-0009 THE NIGHT IN ITS VERMIN HAUNTED CELLS WAS LONG AND COLD NEXT DAY FIFTEEN PRISONERS WERE PUT TO THE BAR BEFORE CHARLES DARNAY'S NAME WAS CALLED ALL THE FIFTEEN WERE CONDEMNED
403-128339-0010 SOME DAGGERS SOME ATE AND DRANK AS THEY LOOKED ON MANY KNITTED AMONG THESE LAST WAS ONE WITH A SPARE PIECE OF KNITTING UNDER HER ARM AS SHE WORKED SHE WAS IN A FRONT ROW BY THE SIDE OF A MAN
403-128339-0011 BUT WHAT HE MOST NOTICED IN THE TWO FIGURES WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE POSTED AS CLOSE TO HIMSELF AS THEY COULD BE THEY NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM THEY SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR SOMETHING WITH A DOGGED DETERMINATION
403-128339-0012 AND THEY LOOKED AT THE JURY BUT AT NOTHING ELSE UNDER THE PRESIDENT SAT DOCTOR MANETTE IN HIS USUAL QUIET DRESS AS WELL AS THE PRISONER COULD SEE HE AND MISTER LORRY WERE THE ONLY MEN THERE UNCONNECTED WITH THE TRIBUNAL
403-128339-0013 WHO WORE THEIR USUAL CLOTHES AND HAD NOT ASSUMED THE COARSE GARB
403-128339-0014 WHOSE LIFE WAS FORFEIT TO THE REPUBLIC UNDER THE DECREE WHICH BANISHED ALL EMIGRANTS ON PAIN OF DEATH IT WAS NOTHING THAT THE DECREE BORE DATE SINCE HIS RETURN TO FRANCE THERE HE WAS AND THERE WAS THE DECREE
403-128339-0015 HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN FRANCE AND HIS HEAD WAS DEMANDED TAKE OFF HIS HEAD CRIED THE AUDIENCE AN ENEMY TO THE REPUBLIC THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO SILENCE THOSE CRIES
403-128339-0016 UNDOUBTEDLY IT WAS WAS HE NOT AN EMIGRANT THEN WHAT DID HE CALL HIMSELF NOT AN EMIGRANT HE HOPED WITHIN THE SENSE AND SPIRIT OF THE LAW WHY NOT THE PRESIDENT DESIRED TO KNOW
403-128339-0017 BECAUSE HE HAD VOLUNTARILY RELINQUISHED A TITLE THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND A STATION THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND HAD LEFT HIS COUNTRY HE SUBMITTED BEFORE THE WORD EMIGRANT IN THE PRESENT ACCEPTATION BY THE TRIBUNAL WAS IN USE
403-128339-0018 TO LIVE BY HIS OWN INDUSTRY IN ENGLAND RATHER THAN ON THE INDUSTRY OF THE OVERLADEN PEOPLE OF FRANCE WHAT PROOF HAD HE OF THIS HE HANDED IN THE NAMES OF TWO WITNESSES THEOPHILE GABELLE AND ALEXANDRE MANETTE
403-128339-0019 THE PRESIDENT REMINDED HIM TRUE BUT NOT AN ENGLISH WOMAN A CITIZENESS OF FRANCE YES BY BIRTH HER NAME AND FAMILY
403-128339-0020 LUCIE MANETTE ONLY DAUGHTER OF DOCTOR MANETTE THE GOOD PHYSICIAN WHO SITS THERE THIS ANSWER HAD A HAPPY EFFECT UPON THE AUDIENCE CRIES IN EXALTATION OF THE WELL KNOWN GOOD PHYSICIAN RENT THE HALL
403-128339-0021 ON THESE FEW STEPS OF HIS DANGEROUS WAY CHARLES DARNAY HAD SET HIS FOOT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR MANETTE'S REITERATED INSTRUCTIONS THE SAME CAUTIOUS COUNSEL DIRECTED EVERY STEP THAT LAY BEFORE HIM
403-128339-0022 AND HAD PREPARED EVERY INCH OF HIS ROAD THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHY HAD HE RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN HE DID AND NOT SOONER HE HAD NOT RETURNED SOONER HE REPLIED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS OF LIVING IN FRANCE SAVE THOSE HE HAD RESIGNED
403-128339-0023 WHEREAS IN ENGLAND HE LIVED BY GIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE HE HAD RETURNED WHEN HE DID ON THE PRESSING AND WRITTEN ENTREATY OF A FRENCH CITIZEN WHO REPRESENTED THAT HIS LIFE WAS ENDANGERED BY HIS ABSENCE
403-128339-0024 HE HAD COME BACK TO SAVE A CITIZEN'S LIFE AND TO BEAR HIS TESTIMONY AT WHATEVER PERSONAL HAZARD TO THE TRUTH WAS THAT CRIMINAL IN THE EYES OF THE REPUBLIC THE POPULACE CRIED ENTHUSIASTICALLY
403-128339-0025 NO AND THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO QUIET THEM WHICH IT DID NOT FOR THEY CONTINUED TO CRY NO
403-128339-0026 THE PRESIDENT REQUIRED THE NAME OF THAT CITIZEN THE ACCUSED EXPLAINED THAT THE CITIZEN WAS HIS FIRST WITNESS HE ALSO REFERRED WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE CITIZEN'S LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM AT THE BARRIER
403-128339-0027 BUT WHICH HE DID NOT DOUBT WOULD BE FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS THEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENT THE DOCTOR HAD TAKEN CARE THAT IT SHOULD BE THERE HAD ASSURED HIM THAT IT WOULD BE THERE
403-128339-0028 THAT IN THE PRESSURE OF BUSINESS IMPOSED ON THE TRIBUNAL BY THE MULTITUDE OF ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC WITH WHICH IT HAD TO DEAL HE HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY OVERLOOKED IN HIS PRISON OF THE ABBAYE IN FACT
403-128339-0029 BY THE SURRENDER OF THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY DOCTOR MANETTE WAS NEXT QUESTIONED HIS HIGH PERSONAL POPULARITY AND THE CLEARNESS OF HIS ANSWERS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION
403-128339-0030 BUT AS HE PROCEEDED AS HE SHOWED THAT THE ACCUSED WAS HIS FIRST FRIEND ON HIS RELEASE FROM HIS LONG IMPRISONMENT THAT THE ACCUSED HAD REMAINED IN ENGLAND ALWAYS FAITHFUL AND DEVOTED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND HIMSELF IN THEIR EXILE THAT
403-128339-0031 SO FAR FROM BEING IN FAVOUR WITH THE ARISTOCRAT GOVERNMENT THERE HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TRIED FOR HIS LIFE BY IT AS THE FOE OF ENGLAND AND FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES AS HE BROUGHT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO VIEW WITH THE GREATEST DISCRETION
403-128339-0032 AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD FORCE OF TRUTH AND EARNESTNESS THE JURY AND THE POPULACE BECAME ONE AT LAST WHEN HE APPEALED BY NAME TO MONSIEUR LORRY AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN THEN AND THERE PRESENT WHO LIKE HIMSELF
403-128339-0033 HAD BEEN A WITNESS ON THAT ENGLISH TRIAL AND COULD CORROBORATE HIS ACCOUNT OF IT THE JURY DECLARED THAT THEY HAD HEARD ENOUGH AND THAT THEY WERE READY WITH THEIR VOTES IF THE PRESIDENT WERE CONTENT TO RECEIVE THEM AT EVERY VOTE
403-128339-0034 THE JURYMEN VOTED ALOUD AND INDIVIDUALLY THE POPULACE SET UP A SHOUT OF APPLAUSE ALL THE VOICES WERE IN THE PRISONER'S FAVOUR AND THE PRESIDENT DECLARED HIM FREE
403-128339-0035 THEN BEGAN ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WITH WHICH THE POPULACE SOMETIMES GRATIFIED THEIR FICKLENESS OR THEIR BETTER IMPULSES TOWARDS GENEROSITY AND MERCY
403-128339-0036 OR WHICH THEY REGARDED AS SOME SET OFF AGAINST THEIR SWOLLEN ACCOUNT OF CRUEL RAGE NO MAN CAN DECIDE NOW TO WHICH OF THESE MOTIVES SUCH EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WERE REFERABLE IT IS PROBABLE TO A BLENDING OF ALL THE THREE
403-128339-0037 WITH THE SECOND PREDOMINATING NO SOONER WAS THE ACQUITTAL PRONOUNCED THAN TEARS WERE SHED AS FREELY AS BLOOD AT ANOTHER TIME AND SUCH FRATERNAL EMBRACES WERE BESTOWED UPON THE PRISONER BY AS MANY OF BOTH SEXES AS COULD RUSH AT HIM
403-128339-0038 THAT AFTER HIS LONG AND UNWHOLESOME CONFINEMENT HE WAS IN DANGER OF FAINTING FROM EXHAUSTION NONE THE LESS BECAUSE HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE VERY SAME PEOPLE CARRIED BY ANOTHER CURRENT WOULD HAVE RUSHED AT HIM WITH THE VERY SAME INTENSITY
403-128339-0039 TO REND HIM TO PIECES AND STREW HIM OVER THE STREETS HIS REMOVAL TO MAKE WAY FOR OTHER ACCUSED PERSONS WHO WERE TO BE TRIED RESCUED HIM FROM THESE CARESSES FOR THE MOMENT
403-128339-0040 FIVE WERE TO BE TRIED TOGETHER NEXT AS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC FORASMUCH AS THEY HAD NOT ASSISTED IT BY WORD OR DEED SO QUICK WAS THE TRIBUNAL TO COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE NATION FOR A CHANCE LOST
403-128339-0041 THAT THESE FIVE CAME DOWN TO HIM BEFORE HE LEFT THE PLACE CONDEMNED TO DIE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE FIRST OF THEM TOLD HIM SO WITH THE CUSTOMARY PRISON SIGN OF DEATH A RAISED FINGER AND THEY ALL ADDED IN WORDS
403-128339-0042 LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THE FIVE HAD HAD IT IS TRUE NO AUDIENCE TO LENGTHEN THEIR PROCEEDINGS FOR WHEN HE AND DOCTOR MANETTE EMERGED FROM THE GATE THERE WAS A GREAT CROWD ABOUT IT
403-128339-0043 IN WHICH THERE SEEMED TO BE EVERY FACE HE HAD SEEN IN COURT EXCEPT TWO FOR WHICH HE LOOKED IN VAIN ON HIS COMING OUT THE CONCOURSE MADE AT HIM ANEW WEEPING EMBRACING AND SHOUTING ALL BY TURNS AND ALL TOGETHER
403-128339-0044 UNTIL THE VERY TIDE OF THE RIVER ON THE BANK OF WHICH THE MAD SCENE WAS ACTED SEEMED TO RUN MAD LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THE SHORE THEY PUT HIM INTO A GREAT CHAIR THEY HAD AMONG THEM
403-128339-0045 IN WINDING AND TRAMPING THROUGH THEM AS THEY HAD REDDENED THEM BELOW THE SNOW WITH A DEEPER DYE THEY CARRIED HIM THUS INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE BUILDING WHERE HE LIVED HER FATHER HAD GONE ON BEFORE TO PREPARE HER
403-128339-0046 AND WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD UPON HIS FEET SHE DROPPED INSENSIBLE IN HIS ARMS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS HEART AND TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD BETWEEN HIS FACE AND THE BRAWLING CROWD
403-128339-0047 SO THAT HIS TEARS AND HER LIPS MIGHT COME TOGETHER UNSEEN A FEW OF THE PEOPLE FELL TO DANCING
403-128339-0048 AFTER GRASPING THE DOCTOR'S HAND AS HE STOOD VICTORIOUS AND PROUD BEFORE HIM AFTER GRASPING THE HAND OF MISTER LORRY
403-128339-0049 AND AFTER EMBRACING THE EVER ZEALOUS AND FAITHFUL PROSS WHO LIFTED HER HE TOOK HIS WIFE IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER UP TO THEIR ROOMS LUCIE MY OWN I AM SAFE O DEAREST CHARLES
403-128339-0050 LET ME THANK GOD FOR THIS ON MY KNEES AS I HAVE PRAYED TO HIM THEY ALL REVERENTLY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND HEARTS WHEN SHE WAS AGAIN IN HIS ARMS HE SAID TO HER
403-128339-0051 NO OTHER MAN IN ALL THIS FRANCE COULD HAVE DONE WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR ME SHE LAID HER HEAD UPON HER FATHER'S BREAST AS SHE HAD LAID HIS POOR HEAD ON HER OWN BREAST LONG LONG AGO HE WAS HAPPY IN THE RETURN HE HAD MADE HER
403-128339-0052 HE WAS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH
403-216-0000 A FEW DAYS PASSED AWAY AND CATHERINE THOUGH NOT ALLOWING HERSELF TO SUSPECT HER FRIEND COULD NOT HELP WATCHING HER CLOSELY THE RESULT OF HER OBSERVATIONS WAS NOT AGREEABLE
403-216-0001 IT MIGHT HAVE PASSED UNNOTICED A SOMETHING OF LANGUID INDIFFERENCE OR OF THAT BOASTED ABSENCE OF MIND WHICH CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE WOULD OCCASIONALLY COME ACROSS HER BUT HAD NOTHING WORSE APPEARED
403-216-0002 THAT MIGHT ONLY HAVE SPREAD A NEW GRACE AND INSPIRED A WARMER INTEREST BUT WHEN CATHERINE SAW HER IN PUBLIC ADMITTING CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ATTENTIONS AS READILY AS THEY WERE OFFERED
403-216-0003 BUT IT WAS A DEGREE OF WILFUL THOUGHTLESSNESS WHICH CATHERINE COULD NOT BUT RESENT JAMES WAS THE SUFFERER SHE SAW HIM GRAVE AND UNEASY AND HOWEVER CARELESS OF HIS PRESENT COMFORT
403-216-0004 AND SHE THOUGHT WITH SINCERE COMPASSION OF HIS APPROACHING DISAPPOINTMENT FOR IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD BELIEVED HERSELF TO OVERHEAR IN THE PUMP ROOM HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS SO INCOMPATIBLE WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF ISABELLA'S ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0005 SHE WISHED BY A GENTLE REMONSTRANCE TO REMIND ISABELLA OF HER SITUATION AND MAKE HER AWARE OF THIS DOUBLE UNKINDNESS BUT FOR REMONSTRANCE EITHER OPPORTUNITY OR COMPREHENSION WAS ALWAYS AGAINST HER
403-216-0006 IF ABLE TO SUGGEST A HINT ISABELLA COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT IN THIS DISTRESS THE INTENDED DEPARTURE OF THE TILNEY FAMILY BECAME HER CHIEF CONSOLATION THEIR JOURNEY INTO GLOUCESTERSHIRE WAS TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN A FEW DAYS
403-216-0007 AND CAPTAIN TILNEY'S REMOVAL WOULD AT LEAST RESTORE PEACE TO EVERY HEART BUT HIS OWN BUT CAPTAIN TILNEY HAD AT PRESENT NO INTENTION OF REMOVING HE WAS NOT TO BE OF THE PARTY TO NORTHANGER HE WAS TO CONTINUE AT BATH
403-216-0008 WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE SHE SPOKE TO HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY FOR MISS THORPE AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0009 MY BROTHER DOES KNOW IT WAS HENRY'S ANSWER DOES HE THEN WHY DOES HE STAY HERE HE MADE NO REPLY AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT SHE EAGERLY CONTINUED
403-216-0010 THE LONGER HE STAYS THE WORSE IT WILL BE FOR HIM AT LAST PRAY ADVISE HIM FOR HIS OWN SAKE AND FOR EVERYBODY'S SAKE TO LEAVE BATH DIRECTLY ABSENCE WILL IN TIME MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE AGAIN BUT HE CAN HAVE NO HOPE HERE
403-216-0011 HENRY SMILED AND SAID I AM SURE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT WISH TO DO THAT THEN YOU WILL PERSUADE HIM TO GO AWAY PERSUASION IS NOT AT COMMAND BUT PARDON ME
403-216-0012 I HAVE MYSELF TOLD HIM THAT MISS THORPE IS ENGAGED HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT AND MUST BE HIS OWN MASTER NO HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT CRIED CATHERINE HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PAIN HE IS GIVING MY BROTHER
403-216-0013 NOT THAT JAMES HAS EVER TOLD ME SO BUT I AM SURE HE IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND ARE YOU SURE IT IS MY BROTHER'S DOING YES VERY SURE IS IT MY BROTHER'S ATTENTIONS TO MISS THORPE
403-216-0014 OR MISS THORPE'S ADMISSION OF THEM THAT GIVES THE PAIN
403-216-0015 I THINK MISTER MORLAND WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE A DIFFERENCE NO MAN IS OFFENDED BY ANOTHER MAN'S ADMIRATION OF THE WOMAN HE LOVES IT IS THE WOMAN ONLY WHO CAN MAKE IT A TORMENT CATHERINE BLUSHED FOR HER FRIEND AND SAID
403-216-0016 ISABELLA IS WRONG BUT I AM SURE SHE CANNOT MEAN TO TORMENT FOR SHE IS VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER SHE HAS BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM EVER SINCE THEY FIRST MET AND WHILE MY FATHER'S CONSENT WAS UNCERTAIN SHE FRETTED HERSELF ALMOST INTO A FEVER
403-216-0017 YOU KNOW SHE MUST BE ATTACHED TO HIM I UNDERSTAND
403-216-0018 AFTER A SHORT PAUSE CATHERINE RESUMED WITH THEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA SO VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER I CAN HAVE NO OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT BUT WHAT CAN YOUR BROTHER MEAN
403-216-0019 IF HE KNOWS HER ENGAGEMENT WHAT CAN HE MEAN BY HIS BEHAVIOUR YOU ARE A VERY CLOSE QUESTIONER AM I I ONLY ASK WHAT I WANT TO BE TOLD
403-216-0020 YES I THINK SO FOR YOU MUST KNOW YOUR BROTHER'S HEART MY BROTHER'S HEART AS YOU TERM IT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I ASSURE YOU I CAN ONLY GUESS AT WELL
403-216-0021 WELL NAY IF IT IS TO BE GUESSWORK LET US ALL GUESS FOR OURSELVES TO BE GUIDED BY SECOND HAND CONJECTURE IS PITIFUL THE PREMISES ARE BEFORE YOU
403-216-0022 AFTER SOME MOMENTS CONSIDERATION YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GUESS AT YOUR BROTHER'S INTENTIONS FROM ALL THIS BUT I AM SURE I CANNOT BUT IS NOT YOUR FATHER UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT
403-216-0023 SURE IF YOUR FATHER WERE TO SPEAK TO HIM HE WOULD GO MY DEAR MISS MORLAND SAID HENRY IN THIS AMIABLE SOLICITUDE FOR YOUR BROTHER'S COMFORT MAY YOU NOT BE A LITTLE MISTAKEN
403-216-0024 ARE YOU NOT CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR WOULD HE THANK YOU EITHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT OR MISS THORPE'S FOR SUPPOSING THAT HER AFFECTION OR AT LEAST HER GOOD BEHAVIOUR IS ONLY TO BE SECURED BY HER SEEING NOTHING OF CAPTAIN TILNEY
403-216-0025 IS HE SAFE ONLY IN SOLITUDE OR IS HER HEART CONSTANT TO HIM ONLY WHEN UNSOLICITED BY ANYONE ELSE HE CANNOT THINK THIS AND YOU MAY BE SURE
403-216-0026 PERCEIVING HER STILL TO LOOK DOUBTFUL AND GRAVE HE ADDED THOUGH FREDERICK DOES NOT LEAVE BATH WITH US HE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN BUT A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS ONLY A FEW DAYS BEHIND US
403-216-0027 HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE WILL SOON EXPIRE AND HE MUST RETURN TO HIS REGIMENT AND WHAT WILL THEN BE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
403-216-0028 THE MESS ROOM WILL DRINK ISABELLA THORPE FOR A FORTNIGHT AND SHE WILL LAUGH WITH YOUR BROTHER OVER POOR TILNEY'S PASSION FOR A MONTH CATHERINE WOULD CONTEND NO LONGER AGAINST COMFORT

4340-15220-0078 LICKING HIS FACE IN SPITE OF HIS STRUGGLES BURROWING IN HIS NECK WITH A TICKLISH NOSE SNAPPING AT HIS BUTTONS AND YELPING JOYFULLY AS IF IT WAS THE BEST JOKE IN THE WORLD TO PLAY HIDE AND SEEK FOR FOUR LONG MILES
4340-15220-0079 BEFORE BEN COULD QUIET HIM BAB CAME CLIMBING UP THE BANK WITH SUCH A FUNNY MIXTURE OF FEAR FATIGUE DETERMINATION AND RELIEF IN HER DIRTY LITTLE FACE
4340-15220-0080 THAT THE BOYS COULD NOT LOOK AWFUL IF THEY TRIED HOW DARED YOU COME AFTER US MISS DEMANDED SAM AS SHE LOOKED CALMLY ABOUT HER AND TOOK A SEAT BEFORE SHE WAS ASKED SANCH WOULD COME AFTER BEN
4340-15220-0081 I COULDN'T MAKE HIM GO HOME SO I HAD TO HOLD ON TILL HE WAS SAFE HERE ELSE HE'D BE LOST AND THEN BEN WOULD FEEL BAD THE CLEVERNESS OF THAT EXCUSE TICKLED THE BOYS IMMENSELY
4340-15220-0082 AND SAM TRIED AGAIN WHILE BEN WAS GETTING THE DOG DOWN AND SITTING ON HIM NOW YOU EXPECT TO GO TO THE CIRCUS I SUPPOSE COURSE I DO BEN SAID HE DIDN'T MIND PAYING IF I COULD GET THERE WITHOUT BOTHERING HIM AND I HAVE

4340-15220-0085 ADVISED SAM THINKING BAB GREAT FUN
4340-15220-0086 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF YOU HADN'T FOUND US ASKED BILLY FORGETTING HIS IMPATIENCE IN HIS ADMIRATION FOR THIS PLUCKY YOUNG LADY I'D HAVE GONE ON AND SEEN THE CIRCUS
4340-15220-0087 WAS THE PROMPT ANSWER BUT YOU HAVEN'T ANY MONEY OH I'D ASK SOMEBODY TO PAY FOR ME I M SO LITTLE IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH
4340-15220-0088 I THOUGHT OF THAT AND PLANNED HOW I'D FIX IT IF I DIDN'T FIND BEN I'D MAKE SANCH DO HIS TRICKS AND GET A QUARTER THAT WAY SO NOW ANSWERED BAB UNDAUNTED BY ANY OBSTACLE I DO BELIEVE SHE WOULD

4340-15220-0092 FISHING OUT SEVERAL FRAGMENTS OF GINGERBREAD STARVING AND BAB ATE THEM WITH SUCH A RELISH THAT SAM ADDED A SMALL CONTRIBUTION AND BEN CAUGHT SOME WATER FOR HER IN HIS HAND WHERE THE LITTLE SPRING BUBBLED UP BESIDE A STONE NOW
4340-15220-0093 COMMANDED BEN GIVING SANCH A ROLL ON THE GRASS TO CLEAN HIM BAB SCRUBBED HER FACE TILL IT SHONE AND PULLING DOWN HER APRON TO WIPE IT SCATTERED A LOAD OF TREASURES COLLECTED IN HER WALK SOME OF THE DEAD FLOWERS
4340-15220-0094 BITS OF MOSS AND GREEN TWIGS FELL NEAR BEN AND ONE ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION A SPRAY OF BROAD SMOOTH LEAVES WITH A BUNCH OF WHITISH BERRIES ON IT WHERE DID YOU GET THAT HE ASKED POKING IT WITH HIS FOOT
4340-15220-0095 IN A SWAMPY PLACE COMING ALONG SANCH SAW SOMETHING DOWN THERE AND I WENT WITH HIM CAUSE I THOUGHT MAY BE IT WAS A MUSK RAT AND YOU'D LIKE ONE IF WE COULD GET HIM
4340-15220-0096 AND WITH INTENSE INTEREST NO ONLY A SNAKE AND I DON'T CARE FOR SNAKES I PICKED SOME OF THAT IT WAS SO GREEN AND PRETTY THORNY LIKES QUEER LEAVES AND BERRIES YOU KNOW ANSWERED BAB SPATTING DOWN HER ROUGH LOCKS
4340-15220-0097 WELL HE WON'T LIKE THAT NOR YOU EITHER
4340-15220-0098 AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF YOU'D GOT POISONED BAB DON'T TOUCH IT
4340-15220-0099 AND BEN LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT BAB WHO FELT HER CHUBBY FACE ALL OVER AND EXAMINED HER DINGY HANDS WITH A SOLEMN AIR ASKING EAGERLY WILL IT BREAK OUT ON ME FORE I GET TO THE CIRCUS
4340-15220-0100 NOT FOR A DAY OR SO I GUESS BUT IT'S BAD WHEN IT DOES COME
5049-25947-0000 THE ROUGH RIDERS AT GUASIMAS ON THE DAY THE AMERICAN TROOPS LANDED ON THE COAST OF CUBA THE CUBANS INFORMED GENERAL WHEELER
5049-25947-0001 BLOCKING THE WAY TO SANTIAGO
5049-25947-0002 NOR EVEN A COLLECTION OF HOUSES IT IS THE MEETING PLACE OF TWO TRAILS WHICH JOIN AT THE APEX OF A V THREE MILES FROM THE SEAPORT TOWN OF SIBONEY AND CONTINUE MERGED IN A SINGLE TRAIL TO SANTIAGO
5049-25947-0003 GENERAL WHEELER GUIDED BY THE CUBANS RECONNOITRED THIS TRAIL ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE AND WITH THE POSITION OF THE ENEMY FULLY EXPLAINED TO HIM RETURNED TO SIBONEY AND INFORMED GENERAL YOUNG AND COLONEL WOOD
5049-25947-0004 THAT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WOULD ATTACK THE SPANISH POSITION
5049-25947-0005 AND WHAT HE WAS TO DO WHEN HE FOUND HIM THAT NIGHT NO ONE SLEPT FOR UNTIL TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TROOPS WERE STILL BEING DISEMBARKED IN THE SURF AND TWO SHIPS OF WAR HAD THEIR SEARCHLIGHTS TURNED ON THE LANDING PLACE
5049-25947-0006 LAY THE CAMP OF THE ROUGH RIDERS AND THROUGH IT CUBAN OFFICERS WERE RIDING THEIR HALF STARVED PONIES AND SCATTERING THE ASHES OF THE CAMP FIRES
5049-25947-0007 BELOW THEM WAS THE BEACH AND THE ROARING SURF IN WHICH A THOUSAND OR SO NAKED MEN WERE ASSISTING AND IMPEDING THE PROGRESS SHOREWARD OF THEIR COMRADES IN PONTOONS AND SHORE BOATS
5049-25947-0008 WHICH WERE BEING HURLED AT THE BEACH LIKE SLEDS DOWN A WATER CHUTE IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST WEIRD AND REMARKABLE SCENES OF THE WAR PROBABLY OF ANY WAR
5049-25947-0009 OR SHOUTING WITH DELIGHT AS THEY PLUNGED INTO THE FIRST BATH THAT HAD OFFERED IN SEVEN DAYS AND THOSE IN THE LAUNCHES AS THEY WERE PITCHED HEAD FIRST AT THE SOIL OF CUBA SIGNALIZED THEIR ARRIVAL BY HOWLS OF TRIUMPH
5049-25947-0010 ON EITHER SIDE ROSE BLACK OVERHANGING RIDGES
5049-25947-0011 OF THE SEARCH LIGHTS SHAMING THE QUIET MOONLIGHT
5049-25947-0012 THE ROUGH RIDERS LEFT CAMP AT FIVE IN THE MORNING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HALF A DOZEN OFFICERS THEY WERE DISMOUNTED AND CARRIED THEIR BLANKET ROLLS HAVERSACKS AMMUNITION AND CARBINES
5049-25947-0013 ALONG THE TRAIL TO THE WEST WHICH WAS ON HIGH GROUND AND A HALF MILE TO A MILE DISTANT FROM THE TRAIL ALONG WHICH GENERAL YOUNG AND HIS REGULARS WERE MARCHING
5049-25947-0014 THERE WAS A VALLEY BETWEEN US AND THE BUSHES WERE SO THICK ON BOTH SIDES OF OUR TRAIL
5049-25947-0015 TO DISTINGUISH THE OTHER COLUMN AS SOON AS THE ROUGH RIDERS HAD REACHED THE TOP OF THE RIDGE NOT TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THEY HAD LEFT CAMP WHICH WAS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT PRESENTED ITSELF COLONEL WOOD ORDERED CAPTAIN CAPRON
5049-25947-0016 NO FLANKERS WERE PLACED FOR THE REASON THAT THE DENSE UNDERGROWTH AND THE TANGLE OF VINES THAT STRETCHED FROM THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES TO THE BUSHES BELOW MADE IT A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
5049-25947-0017 A CUBAN OFFICER AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT THEY RODE SLOWLY IN CONSIDERATION OF THE TROOPERS ON FOOT WHO UNDER A CRUELLY HOT SUN CARRIED HEAVY BURDENS TO THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE TO WALK
5049-25947-0018 WE ADVANCED TALKING IN THAT FASHION AND IN HIGH SPIRITS AND CONGRATULATING OURSELVES IN BEING SHUT OF THE TRANSPORT AND ON BREATHING FINE MOUNTAIN AIR AGAIN
5049-25947-0019 WE HAD BEEN RIDING IN THIS PLEASANT FASHION FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF WITH BRIEF HALTS FOR REST WHEN WOOD STOPPED THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN AND RODE DOWN THE TRAIL TO MEET CAPRON WHO WAS COMING BACK
5049-25947-0020 THERE WAS ON ONE SIDE OF IT A STOUT BARBED WIRE FENCE OF FIVE STRANDS BY SOME FORTUNATE ACCIDENT THIS FENCE HAD BEEN CUT JUST WHERE THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN HALTED ON THE LEFT OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0021 IT SHUT OFF FIELDS OF HIGH GRASS BLOCKED AT EVERY FIFTY YARDS WITH GREAT BARRICADES OF UNDERGROWTH AND TANGLED TREES AND CHAPPARAL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0022 THERE WAS NOT A FOOT OF FREE GROUND THE BUSHES SEEMED ABSOLUTELY IMPENETRABLE AS INDEED THEY WERE LATER FOUND TO BE WHEN WE HALTED THE MEN SAT
5049-25947-0023 OR FANNED THE AIR WITH THEIR HATS THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION SUCH AS THEIR LEADERS POSSESSED AND THEIR ONLY EMOTION WAS ONE OF SATISFACTION AT THE CHANCE THE HALT GAVE THEM
5049-25947-0024 AT THE READY PEERING INTO THE BUSHES WE MUST HAVE WAITED THERE WHILE WOOD RECONNOITRED FOR OVER TEN MINUTES THEN HE RETURNED AND BEGAN DEPLOYING HIS TROOPS OUT AT EITHER SIDE OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0025 G TROOP WAS ORDERED TO BEAT INTO THE BUSHES ON THE RIGHT AND K AND A WERE SENT OVER THE RIDGE ON WHICH WE STOOD DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW TO CONNECT WITH GENERAL YOUNG'S COLUMN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VALLEY
5049-25947-0026 F AND E TROOPS WERE DEPLOYED IN SKIRMISH LINE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE FENCE WOOD HAD DISCOVERED THE ENEMY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE HE EXPECTED TO FIND HIM AND SO FAR FROM BEING SURPRISED HE HAD TIME
5049-25947-0027 ACTING ON A FALSE ALARM AND THAT THERE WERE NO SPANIARDS AHEAD OF US I GUESSED IT WAS CAPRON'S MEN FIRING AT RANDOM TO DISCLOSE THE ENEMY'S POSITION I RAN AFTER G TROOP UNDER CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN AND FOUND
5049-25947-0028 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE THICKET AT ONE MOMENT THE UNDERBRUSH SEEMED SWARMING WITH OUR MEN AND THE NEXT EXCEPT THAT YOU HEARD THE TWIGS BREAKING AND HEAVY BREATHING OR A CRASH AS A VINE PULLED SOME ONE DOWN
5049-25947-0029 THROUGH THE TWO HOURS OF FIGHTING THAT FOLLOWED ALTHOUGH MEN WERE FALLING ALL AROUND US THE SPANIARDS ON THE RIDGE WERE THE ONLY ONES THAT MANY OF US SAW BUT THE FIRE AGAINST US WAS NOT MORE THAN EIGHTY YARDS AWAY
5049-25947-0030 AND SO HOT THAT OUR MEN COULD ONLY LIE FLAT IN THE GRASS AND RETURN IT IN THAT POSITION IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT OUR MEN BELIEVED THEY WERE BEING
5049-25947-0031 WHICH THEY IMAGINED MUST HAVE SWUNG TO THE RIGHT AND HAVING LOST ITS BEARINGS AND HEARING THEM ADVANCING THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH HAD MISTAKEN THEM FOR THE ENEMY THEY ACCORDINGLY CEASED FIRING AND BEGAN SHOUTING
5049-25947-0032 LATER WE EXAMINED THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE TRAIL WHICH CAPRON HELD AND THE POSITION OF G TROOP AND THEY WERE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO ONE ANOTHER
5049-25947-0033 CAPRON COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE FIRED INTO US AT ANY TIME UNLESS HE HAD TURNED DIRECTLY AROUND IN HIS TRACKS AND AIMED UP THE VERY TRAIL HE HAD JUST DESCENDED
5049-25947-0034 THEY COULD NOT SEE TWENTY FEET ON THREE SIDES OF THEM BUT ON THE RIGHT HAND LAY THE VALLEY AND ACROSS IT CAME THE SOUND OF YOUNG'S BRIGADE WHO WERE APPARENTLY HEAVILY ENGAGED
5049-25947-0035 THE ENEMY'S FIRE WAS SO CLOSE THAT THE MEN COULD NOT HEAR THE WORD OF COMMAND AND CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN AND LIEUTENANT GREENWAY UNABLE TO GET THEIR ATTENTION RAN AMONG THEM
5049-25947-0036 LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT RAN UP JUST THEN BRINGING WITH HIM LIEUTENANT WOODBURY KANE AND TEN TROOPERS FROM K TROOP ROOSEVELT LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS BESIDE LLEWELLYN AND CONSULTED WITH HIM EAGERLY
5049-25947-0037 KANE WAS SMILING WITH THE CHARMING CONTENT OF A PERFECTLY HAPPY MAN WHEN CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN TOLD HIM HIS MEN WERE NOT NEEDED AND TO REJOIN HIS TROOP HE LED HIS DETAIL OVER THE EDGE OF THE HILL ON WHICH WE LAY
5049-25947-0038 BUT WALKED ERECT STILL SMILING ROOSEVELT POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ADVANCE FARTHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE NETWORK OF WILD GRAPE VINES THAT MASKED THE SPANIARDS FROM US AND THAT WE MUST CROSS THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0039 DRAGGING THE WOUNDED WITH US OWING TO THE LOW AIM OF THE ENEMY WE WERE FORCED TO MOVE ON OUR KNEES AND CRAWL EVEN THEN MEN WERE HIT ONE MAN NEAR ME WAS SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD
5049-25947-0040 IT HAD BEEN ORDERED TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH GENERAL YOUNG'S COLUMN AND WHILE ADVANCING AND FIRING ON THE RIDGE CAPTAIN JENKINS SENT
5049-25947-0041 BEARER BACK TO CLIMB THE HILL AND WAVE HIS RED AND WHITE BANNER WHERE YOUNG'S MEN COULD SEE IT
5049-25947-0042 BUT HE CONTINUED WAVING IT UNTIL THE TENTH CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY ANSWERED AND THE TWO COLUMNS WERE CONNECTED BY A SKIRMISH LINE COMPOSED OF K TROOP AND A UNDER CAPTAIN BUCKY O'NEILL
5049-25947-0043 G TROOP MEANWHILE HAD HURRIED OVER TO THE LEFT AND PASSING THROUGH THE OPENING IN THE WIRE FENCE HAD SPREAD OUT INTO OPEN ORDER IT FOLLOWED DOWN AFTER CAPTAIN LUNA'S TROOP AND D AND E TROOPS
5049-25947-0044 WHICH WERE WELL ALREADY IN ADVANCE
5049-25947-0045 WOOD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN ALONG IT LEADING HIS HORSE WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE OF USE IN CASE HE HAD TO MOVE QUICKLY TO ALTER HIS ORIGINAL FORMATION
5049-25947-0046 HIS PLAN AT PRESENT WAS TO SPREAD OUT HIS MEN SO THAT THEY WOULD JOIN YOUNG ON THE RIGHT AND ON THE LEFT SWING AROUND UNTIL THEY FLANKED THE ENEMY K AND A TROOPS
5049-25947-0047 IT WAS ONLY BY THE FIRING THAT HE COULD TELL WHERE HIS MEN LAY AND THAT THEY WERE ALWAYS ADVANCING THE ADVANCES WERE MADE IN QUICK DESPERATE RUSHES SOMETIMES THE GROUND GAINED
5049-25947-0048 WAS NO MORE THAN A MAN COVERS IN SLIDING FOR A BASE AT OTHER TIMES HALF A TROOP WOULD RISE AND RACE FORWARD AND THEN BURROW DEEP IN THE HOT GRASS AND FIRE
5049-25947-0049 THE FIRE DISCIPLINE WAS EXCELLENT THE PROPHETS OF EVIL OF THE TAMPA BAY HOTEL HAD FORETOLD THAT THE COWBOYS WOULD SHOOT AS THEY CHOSE AND IN THE FIELD WOULD ACT INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR OFFICERS
5049-25947-0050 HANDICAPPED THEIR STRENGTH CRUELLY THE ENEMY WAS HIDDEN IN THE SHADE OF THE JUNGLE WHILE THEY FOR EVERY THICKET THEY GAINED
5049-25947-0051 WHICH WAS AS HOT AS A STEAM BATH AND WITH THEIR FLESH AND CLOTHING TORN BY THORNS AND THE SWORD LIKE BLADE OF THE SPANISH BAYONET THE GLARE OF THE SUN WAS FULL IN THEIR EYES AND AS FIERCE AS A LIME LIGHT
5049-25947-0052 IT HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO A DRESSING STATION AND THE WOUNDED OF G TROOP WERE LEFT THERE IN THE CARE OF THE HOSPITAL STEWARDS A TALL GAUNT YOUNG MAN WITH A CROSS ON HIS ARM WAS JUST COMING BACK UP THE TRAIL HIS HEAD WAS BENT
5049-25947-0053 I KNEW IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AND YET HE WAS CERTAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER TIME OF EXCITEMENT AND RUSH AND HEAT THEN I REMEMBERED HIM AS NOW HE HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BLOOD AND DIRT AND PERSPIRATION
5049-25947-0054 BUT THEN HE WORE A CANVAS JACKET AND THE MAN HE CARRIED ON HIS SHOULDERS WAS TRYING TO HOLD HIM BACK FROM A WHITE WASHED LINE AND I RECOGNIZED THE YOUNG DOCTOR WITH THE BLOOD BATHING HIS BREECHES AS BOB CHURCH
5049-25947-0055 AND THAT SO FEW OF THEM DIED IS GREATLY DUE TO THIS YOUNG MAN WHO WENT DOWN INTO THE FIRING LINE AND PULLED THEM FROM IT AND BORE THEM OUT OF DANGER
5049-25947-0056 AND THE COLLEGE SWELLS OF THE ROUGH RIDERS
5049-25947-0057 THE WALK DOWN THAT TRAIL PRESENTED ONE OF THE MOST GREWSOME PICTURES OF THE WAR
5049-25947-0058 HAD BEEN ABANDONED ALL ALONG ITS LENGTH IT LOOKED AS THOUGH A RETREATING ARMY HAD FLED ALONG IT RATHER THAN THAT ONE TROOP HAD FOUGHT ITS WAY THROUGH IT TO THE FRONT
5049-25947-0059 FOR THE WOUNDED LYING ALONG ITS LENGTH WERE AS STILL AS THE DEAD BESIDE THEM THE NOISE OF THE LOOSE STONES ROLLING UNDER MY FEET BROUGHT A HOSPITAL STEWARD OUT OF THE BRUSH AND HE CALLED AFTER ME
5049-25947-0060 LIEUTENANT THOMAS IS BADLY WOUNDED IN HERE AND WE CAN'T MOVE HIM
5049-25947-0061 SOME PLACE WHERE THERE IS SHADE AND A BREEZE
5049-25947-0062 LARGE AND POWERFULLY BUILT HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE LEG JUST BELOW THE TRUNK AND I FOUND HIM LYING ON A BLANKET HALF NAKED AND COVERED WITH BLOOD AND WITH HIS LEG BOUND IN TOURNIQUETS MADE OF TWIGS AND POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS
5049-25947-0063 IT GAVE ONE A THRILL OF AWE AND WONDER TO SEE HOW THESE COWBOY SURGEONS WITH A STICK THAT ONE WOULD USE TO LIGHT A PIPE AND WITH THE GAUDY KERCHIEFS THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THEIR NECKS
5049-25947-0064 YOU'RE TAKING ME TO THE FRONT AREN'T YOU YOU SAID YOU WOULD THEY'VE KILLED MY CAPTAIN DO YOU UNDERSTAND THEY'VE KILLED CAPTAIN CAPRON THE MEXICANS THEY'VE KILLED MY CAPTAIN
5049-25947-0065 BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WE STUMBLED OVER THE STONES AND VINES BUMPING HIS WOUNDED BODY AGAINST THE GROUND AND LEAVING A BLACK STREAK IN THE GRASS BEHIND US BUT IT SEEMED TO HURT US MORE THAN IT DID HIM
5049-25947-0066 GRAVE BOYISH FACES FILLED WITH SYMPATHY AND CONCERN ONLY FIFTY FEET FROM HIM AND FARTHER DOWN THE TRAIL I PASSED HIS CAPTAIN WITH HIS BODY PROPPED AGAINST CHURCH'S KNEE
5049-25947-0067 AND WITH HIS HEAD FALLEN ON THE SURGEON'S SHOULDER CAPRON WAS ALWAYS A HANDSOME SOLDIERLY LOOKING MAN
5049-25947-0068 AND AS I SAW HIM THEN DEATH HAD GIVEN HIM A GREAT DIGNITY AND NOBLENESS HE WAS ONLY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD THE AGE WHEN LIFE HAS JUST BEGUN
5049-25947-0069 WITH IT AND THAT THOUGH THEY MIGHT PECK AND MEND AT THE BODY HE HAD RECEIVED HIS FINAL ORDERS
5049-25947-0070 STRANGELY MEAN AND TAWDRY
5049-25947-0071 A BOY WAS LYING WITH A BULLET WOUND BETWEEN HIS EYES HIS CHEST WAS HEAVING WITH SHORT HOARSE NOISES WHICH I GUESSED WERE DUE TO SOME MUSCULAR ACTION ENTIRELY AND THAT HE WAS VIRTUALLY DEAD
5049-25947-0072 SCRIBBLED IN IT IN PENCIL
5049-25947-0073 WE ONLY MET TWO WEEKS AGO AT SAN ANTONIO BUT HE AND ME HAD GOT TO BE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO NOW
5049-25947-0074 WAS WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE FARTHEST POINT
5049-25947-0075 AND I WAS RUNNING FORWARD FEELING CONFIDENT THAT I MUST BE CLOSE ON OUR MEN WHEN I SAW THE BODY OF A SERGEANT BLOCKING THE TRAIL AND STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH ACROSS IT
5049-25947-0076 IT WAS APPARENTLY THE BODY OF THE FIRST MAN KILLED AFTER DEATH THE BODIES OF SOME MEN SEEM TO SHRINK ALMOST INSTANTLY WITHIN THEMSELVES THEY BECOME LIMP AND SHAPELESS
5049-25947-0077 WITH HIS REGIMENT BEHIND HIM AND FACING THE ENEMIES OF HIS COUNTRY THE LINE AT THIS TIME WAS DIVIDED BY THE TRAIL INTO TWO WINGS THE RIGHT WING COMPOSED OF K AND A TROOPS WAS ADVANCING THROUGH THE VALLEY
5049-25947-0078 I BORROWED A CARBINE FROM A WOUNDED MAN AND JOINED THE REMNANT OF L TROOP WHICH WAS CLOSE TO THE TRAIL THIS TROOP WAS THEN COMMANDED BY SECOND LIEUTENANT DAY WHO ON ACCOUNT OF HIS CONDUCT THAT MORNING
5049-25947-0079 AND AT THE BATTLE OF SAN JUAN LATER WHEN HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE ARM WAS PROMOTED TO BE CAPTAIN OF L TROOP OR AS IT WAS LATER OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED CAPRON'S TROOP HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE LINE AS UNCONCERNEDLY
5049-25947-0080 AS THOUGH WE WERE AT TARGET PRACTICE AND AN IRISH SERGEANT BYRNE WAS ASSISTING HIM BY KEEPING UP A CONTINUOUS FLOW OF COMMENTS AND CRITICISMS THAT SHOWED THE KEENEST ENJOYMENT OF THE SITUATION
5049-25947-0081 BYRNE WAS THE ONLY MAN I NOTICED WHO SEEMED TO REGARD THE FIGHT AS IN ANY WAY HUMOROUS
5049-25947-0082 THE CONDITIONS WERE EXCEPTIONAL
5049-25947-0083 AND EIGHTY PER CENT OF THEM HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN UNDER FIRE NOR HAD ONE MAN IN THE REGIMENT EVER FIRED A KRAG JORGENSEN CARBINE UNTIL HE FIRED IT AT A SPANIARD
5049-25947-0084 FOR THEIR ARMS HAD BEEN ISSUED TO THEM SO SOON BEFORE SAILING THAT THEY HAD ONLY DRILLED WITH THEM WITHOUT USING CARTRIDGES TO THIS HANDICAP WAS ALSO ADDED THE NATURE OF THE GROUND
5049-25947-0085 AND THE FACT THAT OUR MEN COULD NOT SEE THEIR OPPONENTS THEIR OWN MEN FELL OR ROLLED OVER ON EVERY SIDE SHOT DOWN BY AN INVISIBLE ENEMY WITH NO ONE UPON WHOM THEY COULD RETALIATE
5049-25947-0086 WITH NO SIGN THAT THE ATTACK MIGHT NOT GO ON INDEFINITELY YET THEY NEVER ONCE TOOK A STEP BACKWARD BUT ADVANCED GRIMLY CLEANING A BUSH OR THICKET OF ITS OCCUPANTS BEFORE CHARGING IT
5049-25947-0087 AND SECURING ITS COVER FOR THEMSELVES AND ANSWERING EACH VOLLEY WITH ONE THAT SOUNDED LIKE AN ECHO OF THE FIRST THE MEN WERE PANTING FOR BREATH THE SWEAT RAN SO READILY INTO THEIR EYES THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE SIGHTS OF THEIR GUNS
5049-25947-0088 THEIR LIMBS UNUSED TO SUCH EXERTION AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF CRAMPED IDLENESS ON THE TROOP SHIP TREMBLED WITH WEAKNESS AND THE SUN BLINDED
5049-25947-0089 BUT TIME AFTER TIME THEY ROSE AND STAGGERED FORWARD THROUGH THE HIGH GRASS
5049-25947-0090 AND PASSING THROUGH A SUCCESSION OF CONVULSIONS HE NEVERTHELESS IN HIS BRIEF MOMENTS OF COMPARATIVE PEACE BORE HIMSELF WITH THE UTMOST CALM
5049-25947-0091 A SOLDIER TO DUTY THAT HE CONTINUED WRITING HIS ACCOUNT OF THE FIGHT
5049-25947-0092 AS AN EXCUSE TO GO TO LEAVE THE FIRING LINE I HAVE WATCHED OTHER FIGHTS WHERE THE MEN ENGAGED WERE QUITE WILLING TO UNSELFISHLY BEAR THE WOUNDED FROM THE ZONE OF DANGER
5049-25947-0093 FOR AGUARDIENTE AND WAS NOW OCCUPIED IN FORCE BY THE ENEMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT ON THE FAR LEFT WAS MOVING UP HIS MEN WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING THIS HOUSE ON THE FLANK
5049-25947-0094 WOOD WHO WAS ALL OVER THE LINE HAD THE SAME OBJECTIVE POINT IN HIS MIND THE TROOP COMMANDERS HAD A GENERAL IDEA THAT THE DISTILLERY WAS THE KEY TO THE ENEMY'S POSITION AND WERE ALL WORKING IN THAT DIRECTION
5049-25947-0095 IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR WOOD AND ROOSEVELT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE CAPTAINS AND AFTER THE FIRST GENERAL ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN THEM THEY RELIED UPON THE LATTER'S INTELLIGENCE TO PULL THEM THROUGH
5049-25947-0096 I DO NOT SUPPOSE WOOD OUT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED ENGAGED SAW MORE THAN THIRTY OF HIS MEN
5049-25947-0097 SO EXCELLENT WAS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE OFFICERS AND SO READY THE SPIRIT OF THE MEN THAT THEY KEPT AN ALMOST PERFECT ALIGNMENT AS WAS SHOWN WHEN THE FINAL ORDER CAME TO CHARGE IN THE OPEN FIELDS
5049-25947-0098 SOME OF THE MEN WHO WERE TWICE DAY'S AGE BEGGED HIM TO LET THEM TAKE THE ENEMY'S IMPROMPTU FORT ON THE RUN BUT HE ANSWERED THEM TOLERANTLY LIKE SPOILED CHILDREN AND HELD THEM DOWN UNTIL THERE WAS A LULL IN THE ENEMY'S FIRE
5049-25947-0099 AND RAN FOR THE COVER THEY WERE DIRECTED TO TAKE LIKE MEN TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE RAIN AND FELL PANTING ON THEIR FACES WHILE THE WESTERN TRAPPERS AND HUNTERS SLIPPED AND WRIGGLED THROUGH THE GRASS LIKE INDIANS
5049-25947-0100 DODGING FROM TREE TRUNK TO TREE TRUNK AND FROM ONE BUSH TO ANOTHER THEY FELL INTO LINE AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE OTHERS BUT WHILE DOING SO THEY HAD NOT ONCE EXPOSED THEMSELVES
5049-25947-0101 SOME OF THE ESCAPES WERE LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS THE MAN ON MY RIGHT CHAMPNEYS MARSHALL OF WASHINGTON HAD ONE BULLET PASS THROUGH HIS SLEEVE AND ANOTHER PASS THROUGH HIS SHIRT WHERE IT WAS PULLED CLOSE TO HIS SPINE
5049-25947-0102 AND ROOSEVELT WAS SO CLOSE TO ONE BULLET WHEN IT STRUCK A TREE THAT IT FILLED HIS EYES AND EARS WITH TINY SPLINTERS MAJOR BRODIE AND LIEUTENANT THOMAS WERE BOTH WOUNDED WITHIN A FEW FEET OF COLONEL WOOD
5049-25947-0103 AT SIBONEY ROWLAND SAT STILL FOR A SHORT TIME
5049-25947-0104 WITH THE REST OF THE WOUNDED BUT TWO DAYS LATER HE APPEARED IN CAMP
5049-25947-0105 A DISTANCE OF SIX MILES AND UPHILL ALL THE WAY CARRYING HIS CARBINE CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN HOSPITAL WOOD SAID I WAS ROWLAND ANSWERED SHEEPISHLY
5049-25947-0106 WHEN SHOT THROUGH THE BODY ASKED TO BE PROPPED UP AGAINST A TREE WITH HIS CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT BESIDE HIM AND THE LAST HIS TROOP SAW OF HIM HE WAS SEATED ALONE GRIMLY FIRING OVER THEIR HEADS
5049-25947-0107 IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ENEMY EARLY IN THE FIGHT I CAME UPON CHURCH ATTENDING TO A YOUNG COWBOY WHO WAS SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST
5049-25947-0108 THE ENTRANCE TO HIS WOUND WAS SO SMALL THAT CHURCH COULD NOT INSERT ENOUGH OF THE GAUZE PACKING TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO MAKE THIS HOLE LARGER HE SAID TO THE BOY OR YOU'LL BLEED TO DEATH
5049-25947-0109 CAN YOU STAND BEING CARRIED DO YOU THINK YOU CAN CARRY ME THE TROOPER ASKED YES WELL EXCLAIMED THE BOY ADMIRINGLY YOU CERTAINLY KNOW YOUR BUSINESS
5049-25947-0110 GAVE HIM HIS CHOICE OF RIDING DOWN TO SIBONEY
5049-25947-0111 OR OF BEING CARRIED A DAY LATER ON A LITTER
5049-25947-0112 YOU CAN START AT ONCE BUT IF YOU WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW WHEN I CAN SPARE THE MEN YOU CAN BE CARRIED ALL THE WAY
5049-25947-0113 AND INTO A HUGE MEXICAN SADDLE HE STUCK HIS WOUNDED ANKLE INTO ONE STIRRUP AND HIS UNTOUCHED ONE INTO THE OTHER AND GATHERED UP THE REINS DOES IT PAIN YOU CAN YOU STAND IT
5049-25947-0114 THE FIRING FROM THE ENEMY SOUNDED LESS NEAR AND THE BULLETS PASSED MUCH HIGHER ROOSEVELT WHO HAD PICKED UP A CARBINE AND WAS FIRING TO GIVE THE DIRECTION TO THE OTHERS DETERMINED UPON A CHARGE
5049-25947-0115 WOOD AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE DECIDED AT THE SAME TIME UPON THE SAME MANOEUVRE IT WAS CALLED WOOD'S BLUFF AFTERWARD FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO BACK IT WITH
5049-25947-0116 WHILE TO THE ENEMY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH HIS WHOLE FORCE WAS BUT THE SKIRMISH LINE IN ADVANCE OF A REGIMENT THE SPANIARDS NATURALLY COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS THIN LINE WHICH SUDDENLY BROKE OUT OF THE BUSHES
5049-25947-0117 AND FROM BEHIND TREES AND CAME CHEERING OUT INTO THE HOT SUNLIGHT WAS THE ENTIRE FIGHTING FORCE AGAINST IT THEY SUPPOSED THE REGIMENT WAS COMING CLOSE ON ITS HEELS
5049-25947-0118 AND AS SPANISH TROOPS HATE BEING RUSHED AS A CAT HATES WATER THEY FIRED A FEW PARTING VOLLEYS AND BROKE AND RAN THE CHEERING HAD THE SAME INVIGORATING EFFECT ON OUR OWN SIDE AS A COLD SHOWER
5049-25947-0119 IT WAS WHAT FIRST TOLD HALF THE MEN WHERE THE OTHER HALF WERE AND IT MADE EVERY INDIVIDUAL MAN FEEL BETTER AS WE KNEW IT WAS ONLY A BLUFF THE FIRST CHEER WAS WAVERING
5049-25947-0120 WHEN WE FIRED A VOLLEY ONE OF THE PRISONERS SAID LATER INSTEAD OF FALLING BACK THEY CAME FORWARD THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO FIGHT TO COME CLOSER AT EVERY VOLLEY
5049-25947-0121 WHERE HE ANNOUNCED HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY THE ENTIRE AMERICAN ARMY ONE OF THE RESIDENTS OF SANTIAGO ASKED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IF THOSE AMERICANS FOUGHT WELL WELL HE REPLIED
5049-25947-0122 STORMING A RIDGE EQUALLY WORTHY OF PRAISE BUT IT HAS SEEMED BETTER NOT TO TRY AND TELL OF ANYTHING I DID NOT SEE BUT TO LIMIT MYSELF TO THE WORK OF THE ROUGH RIDERS TO WHOM AFTER ALL THE VICTORY WAS DUE
5049-25947-0123 AS IT WAS OWING TO COLONEL WOOD'S CHARGE WHICH TOOK THE SPANIARDS IN FLANK THAT GENERAL WHEELER AND GENERAL YOUNG WERE ABLE TO ADVANCE
5049-25947-0124 OVER FOUR TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER INTRENCHED BEHIND RIFLE PITS AND BUSHES IN A MOUNTAIN PASS IN SPITE OF THE SMOKELESS POWDER USED BY THE SPANIARDS
5049-25947-0125 THE ROUGH RIDERS ROUTED THEM OUT OF IT AND DROVE THEM BACK FROM THREE DIFFERENT BARRICADES UNTIL THEY MADE THEIR LAST STAND IN THE RUINED DISTILLERY WHENCE THEY FINALLY DROVE THEM BY ASSAULT
5049-25947-0126 THE EAGER SPIRIT IN WHICH THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IS BEST DESCRIBED IN THE SPANISH SOLDIER'S ANSWER TO THE INQUIRING CIVILIAN THEY TRIED TO CATCH US WITH THEIR HANDS
6147-34605-0000 THE DUCHESS JOSIANA TOWARDS SEVENTEEN O FIVE ALTHOUGH LADY JOSIANA WAS TWENTY THREE AND LORD DAVID FORTY FOUR THE WEDDING HAD NOT YET TAKEN PLACE AND THAT FOR THE BEST REASONS IN THE WORLD
6147-34605-0001 TO HAVE NO TIE UNTIL AS LATE AS POSSIBLE APPEARED TO HIM TO BE A PROLONGATION OF YOUTH MIDDLE AGED YOUNG MEN ABOUNDED IN THOSE RAKISH TIMES THEY GREW GRAY AS YOUNG FOPS THE WIG WAS AN ACCOMPLICE LATER ON POWDER BECAME THE AUXILIARY
6147-34605-0002 WOMEN TOO HAD THEIR SUCCESSES IN THE AUTUMN OF LIFE WITNESS NINON AND MARION SUCH WERE THE MODELS OF THE DAY JOSIANA AND DAVID CARRIED ON A FLIRTATION OF A PARTICULAR SHADE THEY DID NOT LOVE THEY PLEASED EACH OTHER
6147-34605-0003 FELT HERSELF A PRINCESS AND CARRIED HER AUTHORITY OVER HIM WITH A HIGH TONE IN ALL THEIR ARRANGEMENTS SHE HAD A FANCY FOR LORD DAVID LORD DAVID WAS HANDSOME BUT THAT WAS OVER AND ABOVE THE BARGAIN SHE CONSIDERED HIM TO BE FASHIONABLE TO BE FASHIONABLE IS EVERYTHING
6147-34605-0004 JOSIANA THOUGHT GREAT THINGS OF HIS HORSES HIS DOGS HIS LOSSES AT PLAY HIS MISTRESSES LORD DAVID ON HIS SIDE BOWED DOWN BEFORE THE FASCINATIONS OF THE DUCHESS JOSIANA A MAIDEN WITHOUT SPOT OR SCRUPLE
6147-34605-0005 HAUGHTY INACCESSIBLE AND AUDACIOUS HE ADDRESSED SONNETS TO HER WHICH JOSIANA SOMETIMES READ IN THESE SONNETS HE DECLARED THAT TO POSSESS JOSIANA WOULD BE TO RISE TO THE STARS WHICH DID NOT PREVENT HIS ALWAYS PUTTING THE ASCENT OFF TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR
6147-34605-0006 HE WAITED IN THE ANTECHAMBER OUTSIDE JOSIANA'S HEART AND THIS SUITED THE CONVENIENCE OF BOTH AT COURT ALL ADMIRED THE GOOD TASTE OF THIS DELAY LADY JOSIANA SAID IT IS A BORE THAT I SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO MARRY LORD DAVID
6147-34605-0007 I WHO WOULD DESIRE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO BE IN LOVE WITH HIM JOSIANA WAS THE FLESH NOTHING COULD BE MORE RESPLENDENT SHE WAS VERY TALL TOO TALL HER HAIR WAS OF THAT TINGE WHICH MIGHT BE CALLED RED GOLD SHE WAS PLUMP
6147-34605-0008 FRESH STRONG AND ROSY WITH IMMENSE BOLDNESS AND WIT SHE HAD EYES WHICH WERE TOO INTELLIGIBLE SHE HAD NEITHER LOVERS NOR CHASTITY SHE WALLED HERSELF ROUND WITH PRIDE
6147-34605-0009 PROVIDED THAT THE OBJECTS WERE UNCOMMON AND PROPORTIONED TO THE MERITS OF ONE SO HIGHLY PLACED SHE THOUGHT LITTLE OF HER REPUTATION BUT MUCH OF HER GLORY TO APPEAR YIELDING AND TO BE UNAPPROACHABLE IS PERFECTION JOSIANA FELT HERSELF MAJESTIC AND MATERIAL
6147-34605-0010 SHE DISCOURSED ON LOCKE SHE WAS POLITE SHE WAS SUSPECTED OF KNOWING ARABIC TO BE THE FLESH AND TO BE WOMAN ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
6147-34605-0011 WHICH SO READILY TURNS TO LOVE JOSIANA WAS NOT NOT THAT SHE WAS UNFEELING THE ANCIENT COMPARISON OF FLESH TO MARBLE IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE THE BEAUTY OF FLESH CONSISTS IN NOT BEING MARBLE
6147-34605-0012 ITS BEAUTY IS TO PALPITATE TO TREMBLE TO BLUSH TO BLEED TO HAVE FIRMNESS WITHOUT HARDNESS TO BE WHITE WITHOUT BEING COLD TO HAVE ITS SENSATIONS AND ITS INFIRMITIES ITS BEAUTY IS TO BE LIFE AND MARBLE IS DEATH
6147-34605-0013 THE KING HAD MADE HER A DUCHESS AND JUPITER A NEREID A DOUBLE IRRADIATION OF WHICH THE STRANGE BRIGHTNESS OF THIS CREATURE WAS COMPOSED IN ADMIRING HER YOU FELT YOURSELF BECOMING A PAGAN AND A LACKEY HER ORIGIN HAD BEEN BASTARDY AND THE OCEAN
6147-34605-0014 IF SHE HAD STABBED HERSELF IT WOULD LIKE LUCRETIA NOT HAVE BEEN UNTIL AFTERWARDS SHE WAS A VIRGIN STAINED WITH EVERY DEFILEMENT IN ITS VISIONARY STAGE SHE WAS A POSSIBLE ASTARTE IN A REAL DIANA SHE WAS IN THE INSOLENCE OF HIGH BIRTH
6147-34605-0015 JOSIANA BROUGHT TO ONE'S MIND THE LINE
6147-34605-0016 TWO WITH ALL THAT SHE WAS A PRUDE IT WAS THE FASHION REMEMBER ELIZABETH ELIZABETH WAS OF A TYPE THAT PREVAILED IN ENGLAND FOR THREE CENTURIES
6147-34605-0017 THE SIXTEENTH SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH ELIZABETH WAS MORE THAN ENGLISH SHE WAS ANGLICAN HENCE THE DEEP RESPECT OF THE EPISCOPALIAN CHURCH FOR THAT QUEEN RESPECT RESENTED BY THE CHURCH OF ROME WHICH COUNTERBALANCED IT WITH A DASH OF EXCOMMUNICATION
6147-34605-0018 MARY STUART LESS CONCERNED WITH THE CHURCH AND MORE WITH THE WOMAN PART OF THE QUESTION HAD LITTLE RESPECT FOR HER SISTER ELIZABETH AND WROTE TO HER AS QUEEN TO QUEEN AND COQUETTE TO PRUDE YOUR DISINCLINATION TO MARRIAGE ARISES FROM YOUR NOT WISHING TO LOSE THE LIBERTY OF BEING MADE LOVE TO
6147-34605-0019 MARY STUART PLAYED WITH THE FAN ELIZABETH WITH THE AXE AN UNEVEN MATCH THEY WERE RIVALS BESIDES IN LITERATURE MARY STUART COMPOSED FRENCH VERSES ELIZABETH TRANSLATED HORACE THE UGLY ELIZABETH DECREED HERSELF BEAUTIFUL
6147-34605-0020 LIKED QUATRAINS AND ACROSTICS HAD THE KEYS OF TOWNS PRESENTED TO HER BY CUPIDS BIT HER LIPS AFTER THE ITALIAN FASHION ROLLED HER EYES AFTER THE SPANISH HAD IN HER WARDROBE THREE THOUSAND DRESSES AND COSTUMES
6147-34605-0021 COLLARED HATTON BOXED THE EARS OF ESSEX SHOWED HER LEGS TO BASSOMPIERRE AND WAS A VIRGIN
6147-34605-0022 CYNICISM IS AT LEAST AS GOOD AS HYPOCRISY NOWADAYS ENGLAND WHOSE LOYOLA IS NAMED WESLEY CASTS DOWN HER EYES A LITTLE AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF THAT PAST AGE SHE IS VEXED AT THE MEMORY YET PROUD OF IT
6147-34605-0023 JUNO RESOLVES HERSELF INTO ARAMINTA A PRETENSION TO DIVINITY NOT ADMITTED CREATES AFFECTATION IN DEFAULT OF THUNDERCLAPS THERE IS IMPERTINENCE THE TEMPLE SHRIVELS INTO THE BOUDOIR NOT HAVING THE POWER TO BE A GODDESS SHE IS AN IDOL
6147-34605-0024 A GRIMACE OF DISGUST CONCEALS CUPIDITY AND THEN WOMAN FEELS HER WEAK POINT GUARDED BY ALL THAT CASUISTRY OF GALLANTRY WHICH TAKES THE PLACE OF SCRUPLES IN PRUDES IT IS A LINE OF CIRCUMVALLATION WITH A DITCH EVERY PRUDE PUTS ON AN AIR OF REPUGNANCE
6147-34605-0025 TO WHOM IT WAS SAID HE HAD SOLD HIS SISTER MISS CHURCHILL BOLINGBROKE WAS IN HIS MERIDIAN AND RICHELIEU IN HIS DAWN GALLANTRY FOUND ITS CONVENIENCE IN A CERTAIN MEDLEY OF RANKS MEN WERE EQUALIZED BY THE SAME VICES AS THEY WERE LATER ON PERHAPS BY THE SAME IDEAS
6147-34605-0026 DEGRADATION OF RANK AN ARISTOCRATIC PRELUDE BEGAN WHAT THE REVOLUTION WAS TO COMPLETE IT WAS NOT VERY FAR OFF THE TIME WHEN JELYOTTE WAS SEEN PUBLICLY SITTING IN BROAD DAYLIGHT ON THE BED OF THE MARQUISE D'EPINAY IT IS TRUE FOR MANNERS RE ECHO EACH OTHER
6147-34605-0027 THAT IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY SMETON'S NIGHTCAP HAD BEEN FOUND UNDER ANNE BOLEYN'S PILLOW IF THE WORD WOMAN SIGNIFIES FAULT AS I FORGET WHAT COUNCIL DECIDED NEVER WAS WOMAN SO WOMANLIKE AS THEN NEVER COVERING HER FRAILTY BY HER CHARMS
6147-34605-0028 AND HER WEAKNESS BY HER OMNIPOTENCE HAS SHE CLAIMED ABSOLUTION MORE IMPERIOUSLY IN MAKING THE FORBIDDEN THE PERMITTED FRUIT EVE FELL IN MAKING THE PERMITTED THE FORBIDDEN FRUIT SHE TRIUMPHS THAT IS THE CLIMAX
6147-34605-0029 ALL JOSIANA'S INSTINCTS IMPELLED HER TO YIELD HERSELF GALLANTLY RATHER THAN TO GIVE HERSELF LEGALLY TO SURRENDER ON THE SCORE OF GALLANTRY IMPLIES LEARNING
6147-34605-0030 IT WAS A NECESSITY DOUBTLESS BUT WHAT A PITY JOSIANA APPRECIATED LORD DAVID AND SHOWED HIM OFF THERE WAS BETWEEN THEM A TACIT AGREEMENT NEITHER TO CONCLUDE NOR TO BREAK OFF THE ENGAGEMENT THEY ELUDED EACH OTHER THIS METHOD OF MAKING LOVE ONE STEP IN ADVANCE AND TWO BACK
6147-34605-0031 IT IS UNBECOMING TO BE MARRIED FADES ONE'S RIBBONS AND MAKES ONE LOOK OLD AN ESPOUSAL IS A DREARY ABSORPTION OF BRILLIANCY A WOMAN HANDED OVER TO YOU BY A NOTARY HOW COMMONPLACE
6147-34605-0032 THE BRUTALITY OF MARRIAGE CREATES DEFINITE SITUATIONS SUPPRESSES THE WILL KILLS CHOICE HAS A SYNTAX LIKE GRAMMAR REPLACES INSPIRATION BY ORTHOGRAPHY MAKES A DICTATION OF LOVE DISPERSES ALL LIFE'S MYSTERIES
6147-34605-0033 DIMINISHES THE RIGHTS BOTH OF SOVEREIGN AND SUBJECT BY A TURN OF THE SCALE DESTROYS THE CHARMING EQUILIBRIUM OF THE SEXES THE ONE ROBUST IN BODILY STRENGTH THE OTHER ALL POWERFUL IN FEMININE WEAKNESS STRENGTH ON ONE SIDE BEAUTY ON THE OTHER
6147-34605-0034 MAKES ONE A MASTER AND THE OTHER A SERVANT WHILE WITHOUT MARRIAGE ONE IS A SLAVE THE OTHER A QUEEN TO MAKE LOVE PROSAICALLY DECENT HOW GROSS
6147-34605-0035 LORD DAVID WAS RIPENING FORTY TIS A MARKED PERIOD HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THIS AND IN TRUTH HE LOOKED NO MORE THAN THIRTY HE CONSIDERED IT MORE AMUSING TO DESIRE JOSIANA THAN TO POSSESS HER HE POSSESSED OTHERS HE HAD MISTRESSES
6147-34605-0036 ON THE OTHER HAND JOSIANA HAD DREAMS THE DUCHESS JOSIANA HAD A PECULIARITY LESS RARE THAN IT IS SUPPOSED ONE OF HER EYES WAS BLUE AND THE OTHER BLACK HER PUPILS WERE MADE FOR LOVE AND HATE FOR HAPPINESS AND MISERY
6147-34605-0037 NIGHT AND DAY WERE MINGLED IN HER LOOK HER AMBITION WAS THIS TO SHOW HERSELF CAPABLE OF IMPOSSIBILITIES ONE DAY SHE SAID TO SWIFT YOU PEOPLE FANCY THAT YOU KNOW WHAT SCORN IS YOU PEOPLE MEANT THE HUMAN RACE
6147-34605-0038 SHE WAS A SKIN DEEP PAPIST HER CATHOLICISM DID NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT NECESSARY FOR FASHION
6147-34605-0039 SHE WORE GREAT DRESSES OF VELVET SATIN OR MOIRE SOME COMPOSED OF FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YARDS OF MATERIAL WITH EMBROIDERIES OF GOLD AND SILVER AND ROUND HER WAIST MANY KNOTS OF PEARLS ALTERNATING WITH OTHER PRECIOUS STONES SHE WAS EXTRAVAGANT IN GOLD LACE
6147-34605-0040 SOMETIMES SHE WORE AN EMBROIDERED CLOTH JACKET LIKE A BACHELOR
6147-34606-0000 JUST AS IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR EUGENE DEVERIA WAS THE FIRST TO ALLOW HIS BEARD TO GROW
6147-34606-0001 DISGUISED BY ARTFUL CURLING FOR TO RISK ONE'S HAIR WAS ALMOST TO RISK ONE'S HEAD THE INDIGNATION WAS UNIVERSAL NEVERTHELESS
6147-34606-0002 AND A PEER OF ENGLAND HE WAS INSULTED AND THE DEED WAS WELL WORTH THE INSULT IN THE HOTTEST PART OF THE ROW LORD DAVID SUDDENLY APPEARED WITHOUT HIS WIG AND IN HIS OWN HAIR SUCH CONDUCT SHAKES THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIETY
6147-34606-0003 HE HELD HIS GROUND PRINCE DEVEREUX WAS THE FIRST LORD DAVID DIRRY MOIR THE SECOND IT IS SOMETIMES MORE DIFFICULT TO BE SECOND THAN FIRST IT REQUIRES LESS GENIUS BUT MORE COURAGE THE FIRST INTOXICATED BY THE NOVELTY MAY IGNORE THE DANGER
6147-34606-0004 MEN FOUND SUFFICIENT AUDACITY TO WEAR THEIR OWN HAIR AND POWDER WAS INTRODUCED AS AN EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH BEFORE WE PASS ON AN IMPORTANT PERIOD OF HISTORY WE SHOULD REMARK THAT THE FIRST BLOW IN THE WAR OF WIGS WAS REALLY STRUCK BY A QUEEN
6147-34606-0005 SUCH GREAT THINGS MADE HIM A MARK FOR PUBLIC ADMIRATION THERE WAS NOT A CLUB OF WHICH HE WAS NOT THE LEADER NOT A BOXING MATCH IN WHICH HE WAS NOT DESIRED AS REFEREE THE REFEREE IS THE ARBITRATOR HE HAD DRAWN UP THE RULES OF SEVERAL CLUBS IN HIGH LIFE
6147-34606-0006 THE LOWEST STAKE ALLOWED WAS A ROULEAU OF FIFTY GUINEAS AND THERE WAS NEVER LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND GUINEAS ON THE TABLE BY THE SIDE OF EACH PLAYER WAS A LITTLE STAND ON WHICH TO PLACE HIS CUP OF TEA AND A GILT BOWL IN WHICH TO PUT THE ROULEAUX OF GUINEAS THE PLAYERS LIKE SERVANTS WHEN CLEANING KNIVES
6147-34606-0007 WORE LEATHER SLEEVES TO SAVE THEIR LACE BREASTPLATES OF LEATHER TO PROTECT THEIR RUFFLES
6147-34606-0008 THOUGH HANDSOME HE BELONGED TO THE UGLY CLUB THIS CLUB WAS DEDICATED TO DEFORMITY THE MEMBERS AGREED TO FIGHT NOT ABOUT A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN BUT ABOUT AN UGLY MAN THE HALL OF THE CLUB WAS ADORNED BY HIDEOUS PORTRAITS
6147-34606-0009 TRIBOULET DUNS HUDIBRAS SCARRON OVER THE CHIMNEY WAS A ESOP BETWEEN TWO MEN EACH BLIND OF AN EYE
6147-34606-0010 COCLES BEING BLIND OF THE LEFT CAMOENS OF THE RIGHT EYE SO ARRANGED THAT THE TWO PROFILES WITHOUT EYES WERE TURNED TO EACH OTHER THE DAY THAT THE BEAUTIFUL MISSUS VISART CAUGHT THE SMALL POX THE UGLY CLUB TOASTED HER THIS CLUB WAS STILL IN EXISTENCE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
6147-34606-0011 AND MIRABEAU WAS ELECTED AN HONORARY MEMBER
6147-34606-0012 THERE WAS THE FUN CLUB FUN IS LIKE CANT LIKE HUMOUR A WORD WHICH IS UNTRANSLATABLE FUN IS TO FARCE WHAT PEPPER IS TO SALT TO GET INTO A HOUSE AND BREAK A VALUABLE MIRROR SLASH THE FAMILY PORTRAITS POISON THE DOG
6147-34606-0013 TO GIVE BAD NEWS WHICH IS UNTRUE WHEREBY PEOPLE PUT ON MOURNING BY MISTAKE IS FUN IT WAS FUN TO CUT A SQUARE HOLE IN THE HOLBEIN AT HAMPTON COURT
6147-34606-0014 A YOUNG MILLIONAIRE LORD WHO HAD DURING THE NIGHT SET FIRE TO A THATCHED COTTAGE A FEAT WHICH MADE ALL LONDON BURST WITH LAUGHTER WAS PROCLAIMED THE KING OF FUN THE POOR DEVILS IN THE COTTAGE WERE SAVED IN THEIR NIGHT CLOTHES THE MEMBERS OF THE FUN CLUB ALL OF THE HIGHEST ARISTOCRACY
6147-34606-0015 USED TO RUN ABOUT LONDON DURING THE HOURS WHEN THE CITIZENS WERE ASLEEP PULLING THE HINGES FROM THE SHUTTERS CUTTING OFF THE PIPES OF PUMPS FILLING UP CISTERNS DIGGING UP CULTIVATED PLOTS OF GROUND PUTTING OUT LAMPS SAWING THROUGH THE BEAMS WHICH SUPPORTED HOUSES
6147-34606-0016 IT WAS THE RICH WHO ACTED THUS TOWARDS THE POOR FOR THIS REASON NO COMPLAINT WAS POSSIBLE THAT WAS THE BEST OF THE JOKE THOSE MANNERS HAVE NOT ALTOGETHER DISAPPEARED IN MANY PLACES IN ENGLAND AND IN ENGLISH POSSESSIONS AT GUERNSEY FOR INSTANCE
6147-34606-0017 TO INJURE TO FULFIL THIS DUTY ALL MEANS WERE HELD GOOD IN BECOMING A MOHAWK THE MEMBERS TOOK AN OATH TO BE HURTFUL TO INJURE AT ANY PRICE NO MATTER WHEN NO MATTER WHOM NO MATTER WHERE WAS A MATTER OF DUTY
6147-34606-0018 THE GENTLEMAN BEHIND HIM CHASTISED HIM FOR THIS BY A PRICK OF HIS SWORD WHICH MADE HIM SPRING ROUND ANOTHER PRICK IN THE BACK WARNED THE FELLOW THAT ONE OF NOBLE BLOOD WAS BEHIND HIM AND SO ON EACH ONE WOUNDING HIM IN HIS TURN WHEN THE MAN CLOSED ROUND BY THE CIRCLE OF SWORDS AND COVERED WITH BLOOD
6147-34606-0019 HAD TURNED AND DANCED ABOUT ENOUGH THEY ORDERED THEIR SERVANTS TO BEAT HIM WITH STICKS TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HIS IDEAS OTHERS HIT THE LION THAT IS THEY GAILY STOPPED A PASSENGER
6147-34606-0020 IF HIS EYES WERE GOUGED OUT HE WAS PAID FOR THEM SUCH WERE TOWARDS THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE PASTIMES OF THE RICH IDLERS OF LONDON THE IDLERS OF PARIS HAD THEIRS
6147-34606-0021 JUST LIKE ANY ONE ELSE HE WOULD GAILY SET FIRE TO A COT OF WOODWORK AND THATCH AND JUST SCORCH THOSE WITHIN BUT HE WOULD REBUILD THEIR HOUSES IN STONE HE INSULTED TWO LADIES ONE WAS UNMARRIED HE GAVE HER A PORTION THE OTHER WAS MARRIED HE HAD HER HUSBAND APPOINTED CHAPLAIN
6147-34606-0022 AND ALL THOSE ON THE NECK SO MUCH LESS FOR THE ENEMY'S BEAK HE USED TO SAY THEN HE EXTENDED THE COCK'S WINGS AND CUT EACH FEATHER ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO A POINT AND THUS THE WINGS WERE FURNISHED WITH DARTS SO MUCH FOR THE ENEMY'S EYES HE WOULD SAY
6147-34606-0023 THEN HE SCRAPED ITS CLAWS WITH A PENKNIFE SHARPENED ITS NAILS FITTED IT WITH SPURS OF SHARP STEEL SPAT ON ITS HEAD SPAT ON ITS NECK ANOINTED IT WITH SPITTLE AS THEY USED TO RUB OIL OVER ATHLETES THEN SET IT DOWN IN THE PIT A REDOUBTABLE CHAMPION EXCLAIMING
6147-34606-0024 THAT'S HOW TO MAKE A COCK AN EAGLE AND A BIRD OF THE POULTRY YARD A BIRD OF THE MOUNTAIN LORD DAVID ATTENDED PRIZE FIGHTS AND WAS THEIR LIVING LAW ON OCCASIONS OF GREAT PERFORMANCES
6147-34606-0025 AND FROM HIS OWN MOUTH FILLED WITH WATER BLOWING A FINE RAIN INTO HIS EYES AND EARS A THING WHICH REANIMATES EVEN A DYING MAN IF HE WAS REFEREE HE SAW THAT THERE WAS NO FOUL PLAY PREVENTED ANY ONE WHOSOEVER HE MIGHT BE FROM ASSISTING THE COMBATANTS EXCEPTING THE SECONDS
6147-34606-0026 DECLARE THE MAN BEATEN WHO DID NOT FAIRLY FACE HIS OPPONENT WATCHED THAT THE TIME BETWEEN THE ROUNDS DID NOT EXCEED HALF A MINUTE PREVENTED BUTTING
6147-34606-0027 AND FORBADE A MAN'S BEING HIT WHEN DOWN ALL THIS SCIENCE HOWEVER DID NOT RENDER HIM A PEDANT NOR DESTROY HIS EASE OF MANNER IN SOCIETY WHEN HE WAS REFEREE ROUGH PIMPLE FACED UNSHORN FRIENDS OF EITHER COMBATANT NEVER DARED TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR FAILING MAN
6147-34606-0028 LORD DAVID WAS ONE OF THE FEW REFEREES WHOM THEY DARED NOT THRASH NO ONE COULD TRAIN LIKE HIM THE PUGILIST WHOSE TRAINER HE CONSENTED TO BECOME WAS SURE TO WIN LORD DAVID WOULD CHOOSE A HERCULES MASSIVE AS A ROCK TALL AS A TOWER AND MAKE HIM HIS CHILD
6147-34606-0029 THE PROBLEM WAS TO TURN THAT HUMAN ROCK FROM A DEFENSIVE TO AN OFFENSIVE STATE IN THIS HE EXCELLED HAVING ONCE ADOPTED THE CYCLOPS HE NEVER LEFT HIM HE BECAME HIS NURSE HE MEASURED OUT HIS WINE WEIGHED HIS MEAT AND COUNTED HIS HOURS OF SLEEP
6147-34606-0030 IT WAS HE WHO INVENTED THE ATHLETE'S ADMIRABLE RULES
6147-34606-0031 AFTER WHICH HE UNDRESSED HIS MAN RUBBED HIM AND PUT HIM TO BED IN THE STREET HE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO LEAVE HIS SIGHT KEEPING HIM OUT OF EVERY DANGER RUNAWAY HORSES THE WHEELS OF CARRIAGES DRUNKEN SOLDIERS PRETTY GIRLS HE WATCHED OVER HIS VIRTUE
6147-34606-0032 THIS MATERNAL SOLICITUDE CONTINUALLY BROUGHT SOME NEW PERFECTION INTO THE PUPIL'S EDUCATION HE TAUGHT HIM THE BLOW WITH THE FIST WHICH BREAKS THE TEETH AND THE TWIST OF THE THUMB WHICH GOUGES OUT THE EYE WHAT COULD BE MORE TOUCHING THUS HE WAS PREPARING HIMSELF FOR PUBLIC LIFE TO WHICH HE WAS TO BE CALLED LATER ON
6147-34606-0033 IT IS NO EASY MATTER TO BECOME AN ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMAN LORD DAVID DIRRY MOIR WAS PASSIONATELY FOND OF OPEN AIR EXHIBITIONS OF SHOWS OF CIRCUSES WITH WILD BEASTS OF THE CARAVANS OF MOUNTEBANKS OF CLOWNS TUMBLERS MERRYMEN OPEN AIR FARCES AND THE WONDERS OF A FAIR
6147-34606-0034 THE TRUE NOBLE IS HE WHO SMACKS OF THE PEOPLE THEREFORE IT WAS THAT LORD DAVID FREQUENTED THE TAVERNS AND LOW HAUNTS OF LONDON AND THE CINQUE PORTS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE AT NEED AND WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS RANK IN THE WHITE SQUADRON TO BE CHEEK BY JOWL WITH A TOPMAN OR A CALKER
6147-34607-0000 ABOVE THIS COUPLE THERE WAS ANNE QUEEN OF ENGLAND AN ORDINARY WOMAN WAS QUEEN ANNE SHE WAS GAY KINDLY AUGUST TO A CERTAIN EXTENT NO QUALITY OF HERS ATTAINED TO VIRTUE NONE TO VICE
6147-34607-0001 HER STOUTNESS WAS BLOATED HER FUN HEAVY HER GOOD NATURE STUPID SHE WAS STUBBORN AND WEAK AS A WIFE SHE WAS FAITHLESS AND FAITHFUL HAVING FAVOURITES TO WHOM SHE GAVE UP HER HEART AND A HUSBAND FOR WHOM SHE KEPT HER BED
6147-34607-0002 AS A CHRISTIAN SHE WAS A HERETIC AND A BIGOT SHE HAD ONE BEAUTY
6147-34607-0003 THE REST OF HER PERSON WAS INDIFFERENTLY FORMED SHE WAS A CLUMSY COQUETTE AND A CHASTE ONE HER SKIN WAS WHITE AND FINE SHE DISPLAYED A GREAT DEAL OF IT IT WAS SHE WHO INTRODUCED THE FASHION OF NECKLACES OF LARGE PEARLS CLASPED ROUND THE THROAT
6147-34607-0004 SHE HAD A NARROW FOREHEAD SENSUAL LIPS FLESHY CHEEKS LARGE EYES SHORT SIGHT HER SHORT SIGHT EXTENDED TO HER MIND BEYOND A BURST OF MERRIMENT NOW AND THEN ALMOST AS PONDEROUS AS HER ANGER
6147-34607-0005 SHE LIVED IN A SORT OF TACITURN GRUMBLE AND A GRUMBLING SILENCE WORDS ESCAPED FROM HER WHICH HAD TO BE GUESSED AT SHE WAS A MIXTURE OF A GOOD WOMAN AND A MISCHIEVOUS DEVIL SHE LIKED SURPRISES WHICH IS EXTREMELY WOMAN LIKE ANNE WAS A PATTERN
6147-34607-0006 SHE HAD FITS OF RAGE SHE WAS VIOLENT A BRAWLER NOBODY MORE AWKWARD THAN ANNE IN DIRECTING AFFAIRS OF STATE SHE ALLOWED EVENTS TO FALL ABOUT AS THEY MIGHT CHANCE HER WHOLE POLICY WAS CRACKED
6147-34607-0007 SHE EXCELLED IN BRINGING ABOUT GREAT CATASTROPHES FROM LITTLE CAUSES WHEN A WHIM OF AUTHORITY TOOK HOLD OF HER
6147-34607-0008 SHE DID NOT EXPLAIN HER THOUGHT SHE EXUDED IT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THE SPHINX IN THIS GOOSE SHE RATHER LIKED FUN TEASING AND PRACTICAL JOKES COULD SHE HAVE MADE APOLLO A HUNCHBACK IT WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED HER BUT SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM A GOD
6147-34607-0009 GOOD NATURED HER IDEAL WAS TO ALLOW NONE TO DESPAIR AND TO WORRY ALL SHE HAD OFTEN A ROUGH WORD IN HER MOUTH
6147-34607-0010 WITH WHICH SHE REDDENED HER LIPS AND HAVING COLOURED HER MOUTH WOULD LAUGH SHE WAS GREEDILY FOND OF THE FLAT ZEALAND GINGERBREAD CAKES SHE WAS PROUD OF BEING FAT MORE OF A PURITAN THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHE WOULD NEVERTHELESS
6147-34607-0011 HAVE LIKED TO DEVOTE HERSELF TO STAGE PLAYS SHE HAD AN ABSURD ACADEMY OF MUSIC COPIED AFTER THAT OF FRANCE IN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED A FRENCHMAN NAMED FORETROCHE WANTED TO BUILD A ROYAL CIRCUS AT PARIS AT A COST OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
6147-34607-0012 THE ASSEMBLY OF TWELVE PERSONS WERE IT ONLY TO EAT OYSTERS AND DRINK PORTER WAS A FELONY UNDER HER REIGN OTHERWISE RELATIVELY MILD PRESSING FOR THE FLEET WAS CARRIED ON WITH EXTREME VIOLENCE A GLOOMY EVIDENCE THAT THE ENGLISHMAN IS A SUBJECT RATHER THAN A CITIZEN
6147-34607-0013 FOR CENTURIES ENGLAND SUFFERED UNDER THAT PROCESS OF TYRANNY WHICH GAVE THE LIE TO ALL THE OLD CHARTERS OF FREEDOM AND OUT OF WHICH FRANCE ESPECIALLY GATHERED A CAUSE OF TRIUMPH AND INDIGNATION WHAT IN SOME DEGREE DIMINISHES THE TRIUMPH IS THAT WHILE SAILORS WERE PRESSED IN ENGLAND
6147-34607-0014 SOLDIERS WERE PRESSED IN FRANCE IN EVERY GREAT TOWN OF FRANCE ANY ABLE BODIED MAN GOING THROUGH THE STREETS ON HIS BUSINESS WAS LIABLE TO BE SHOVED BY THE CRIMPS INTO A HOUSE CALLED THE OVEN
6147-34607-0015 THOSE FIT FOR SERVICE WERE PICKED OUT
6147-34607-0016 IN SIXTEEN NINETY FIVE THERE WERE THIRTY OF THESE OVENS IN PARIS THE LAWS AGAINST IRELAND EMANATING FROM QUEEN ANNE WERE ATROCIOUS ANNE WAS BORN IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDON ON WHICH THE ASTROLOGERS THERE WERE SOME LEFT
6147-34607-0017 PREDICTED THAT BEING THE ELDER SISTER OF FIRE SHE WOULD BE QUEEN AND SO SHE WAS THANKS TO ASTROLOGY AND THE REVOLUTION OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SHE HAD THE HUMILIATION OF HAVING ONLY GILBERT ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY FOR GODFATHER TO BE GODCHILD OF THE POPE WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE IN ENGLAND
6147-34607-0018 A MERE PRIMATE IS BUT A POOR SORT OF GODFATHER ANNE HAD TO PUT UP WITH ONE HOWEVER IT WAS HER OWN FAULT WHY WAS SHE A PROTESTANT DENMARK HAD PAID FOR HER VIRGINITY VIRGINITAS EMPTA AS THE OLD CHARTERS EXPRESSED IT
6147-34607-0019 THERE WAS NEVER A BON MOT BUT IN FRENCH ANNE PAID A DEAL OF ATTENTION TO HER COINS ESPECIALLY TO COPPER COINS WHICH ARE THE LOW AND POPULAR ONES SHE WANTED TO CUT A GREAT FIGURE ON THEM SIX FARTHINGS WERE STRUCK DURING HER REIGN
6147-34607-0020 ON THE BACK OF THE FIRST THREE SHE HAD MERELY A THRONE STRUCK ON THE BACK OF THE FOURTH SHE ORDERED A TRIUMPHAL CHARIOT AND ON THE BACK OF THE SIXTH A GODDESS HOLDING A SWORD IN ONE HAND AND AN OLIVE BRANCH IN THE OTHER WITH THE SCROLL
6147-34607-0021 WHY FRANCE EXCLUDES THEM THERE IS A REASON AT ONCE PERHAPS THERE IS NO OTHER WITH ENGLISH HISTORIANS ELIZABETH EMBODIES GRANDEUR ANNE GOOD NATURE AS THEY WILL BE IT SO BUT THERE IS NOTHING DELICATE IN THE REIGNS OF THESE WOMEN THE LINES ARE HEAVY
6147-34607-0022 THREE ONE IDIOTIC HABIT OF THE PEOPLE IS TO ATTRIBUTE TO THE KING WHAT THEY DO THEMSELVES THEY FIGHT WHOSE THE GLORY THE KING'S THEY PAY WHOSE THE GENEROSITY THE KING'S THEN THE PEOPLE LOVE HIM FOR BEING SO RICH
6147-34607-0023 THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE RESERVED FOR KINGS ALONE IS AN EXCELLENT FIGURE OF ROYALTY THE HORSE IS THE PEOPLE ONLY THAT THE HORSE BECOMES TRANSFIGURED BY DEGREES IT BEGINS IN AN ASS IT ENDS IN A LION
6147-34607-0024 THEN IT THROWS ITS RIDER AND YOU HAVE SIXTEEN FORTY TWO IN ENGLAND AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN FRANCE AND SOMETIMES IT DEVOURS HIM AND YOU HAVE IN ENGLAND SIXTEEN FORTY NINE AND IN FRANCE SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE THAT THE LION SHOULD RELAPSE INTO THE DONKEY IS ASTONISHING BUT IT IS SO
6147-34607-0025 COUNTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN HER FLEET THE ENGLISH HAD THREE ARMIES FIVE THOUSAND MEN IN CATALONIA TEN THOUSAND IN PORTUGAL FIFTY THOUSAND IN FLANDERS
6147-34607-0026 TO MONARCHICAL AND DIPLOMATIC EUROPE A SORT OF PROSTITUTE THE ENGLISH PEOPLE HAS ALWAYS HAD IN KEEPING PARLIAMENT HAVING VOTED A PATRIOTIC LOAN OF THIRTY FOUR MILLION FRANCS OF ANNUITIES THERE HAD BEEN A CRUSH AT THE EXCHEQUER TO SUBSCRIBE IT
6147-34607-0027 AND THAT HE WOULD BE BUT TOO HAPPY IF ENGLAND WOULD ONLY TOLERATE THE KING OF FRANCE FISHING FOR COD AT CAPE BRETON ENGLAND WAS ABOUT TO IMPOSE UPON HIM THE SHAME OF DEMOLISHING HIMSELF THE FORTIFICATIONS OF DUNKIRK MEANWHILE SHE HAD TAKEN GIBRALTAR AND WAS TAKING BARCELONA
6147-34607-0028 WHAT GREAT THINGS ACCOMPLISHED HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO REFUSE ANNE ADMIRATION FOR TAKING THE TROUBLE OF LIVING AT THE PERIOD
6147-34607-0029 BEARS TO HIM THE VAGUE RESEMBLANCE OF A REFLECTION LIKE HIM SHE PLAYS AT A GREAT REIGN SHE HAS HER MONUMENTS HER ARTS HER VICTORIES HER CAPTAINS HER MEN OF LETTERS HER PRIVY PURSE TO PENSION CELEBRITIES HER GALLERY OF CHEFS D'OEUVRE
6147-34607-0030 SIDE BY SIDE WITH THOSE OF HIS MAJESTY HER COURT TOO WAS A CORTEGE WITH THE FEATURES OF A TRIUMPH AN ORDER AND A MARCH IT WAS A MINIATURE COPY OF ALL THE GREAT MEN OF VERSAILLES NOT GIANTS THEMSELVES
6147-34607-0031 IN IT THERE IS ENOUGH TO DECEIVE THE EYE ADD GOD SAVE THE QUEEN WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM LULLI AND THE ENSEMBLE BECOMES AN ILLUSION NOT A PERSONAGE IS MISSING CHRISTOPHER WREN IS A VERY PASSABLE MANSARD SOMERS IS AS GOOD AS LAMOIGNON ANNE HAS A RACINE IN DRYDEN
6147-34607-0032 A LOUVOIS IN PEMBROKE AND A TURENNE IN MARLBOROUGH HEIGHTEN THE WIGS AND LOWER THE FOREHEADS THE WHOLE IS SOLEMN AND POMPOUS AND THE WINDSOR OF THE TIME HAS A FADED RESEMBLANCE TO MARLY STILL THE WHOLE WAS EFFEMINATE AND ANNE'S PERE TELLIER WAS CALLED SARAH JENNINGS
6147-34607-0033 HOWEVER THERE IS AN OUTLINE OF INCIPIENT IRONY WHICH FIFTY YEARS LATER WAS TO TURN TO PHILOSOPHY IN THE LITERATURE OF THE AGE AND THE PROTESTANT TARTUFFE IS UNMASKED BY SWIFT
6147-34607-0034 ALTHOUGH THE ENGLAND OF THE PERIOD QUARRELS AND FIGHTS FRANCE SHE IMITATES HER AND DRAWS ENLIGHTENMENT FROM HER AND THE LIGHT ON THE FACADE OF ENGLAND IS FRENCH LIGHT IT IS A PITY THAT ANNE'S REIGN LASTED BUT TWELVE YEARS OR THE ENGLISH WOULD NOT HESITATE TO CALL IT THE CENTURY OF ANNE
6147-34607-0035 WAS GREATLY ADMIRED IN ENGLAND HE IS THE KIND OF KING THEY WANT IN FRANCE SAID THE ENGLISH THE LOVE OF THE ENGLISH FOR THEIR OWN LIBERTY IS MINGLED WITH A CERTAIN ACCEPTANCE OF SERVITUDE FOR OTHERS THAT FAVOURABLE REGARD OF THE CHAINS WHICH BIND THEIR NEIGHBOURS
6147-34607-0036 NOT FROM CHOICE HOWEVER A PART OF HER RELIGION SHE DERIVED FROM THAT UGLINESS
6147-34607-0037 WAS A CAUSE OF VEXATION TO THE QUEEN TO AN UGLY QUEEN A PRETTY DUCHESS IS NOT AN AGREEABLE SISTER THERE WAS ANOTHER GRIEVANCE JOSIANA'S IMPROPER BIRTH ANNE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF ANNE HYDE A SIMPLE GENTLEWOMAN LEGITIMATELY
6147-34607-0038 ANNE HAVING THIS INFERIOR BLOOD IN HER VEINS FELT HERSELF BUT HALF ROYAL AND JOSIANA HAVING COME INTO THE WORLD QUITE IRREGULARLY DREW CLOSER ATTENTION TO THE INCORRECTNESS LESS GREAT BUT REALLY EXISTING IN THE BIRTH OF THE QUEEN
6147-34607-0039 THE DAUGHTER OF MESALLIANCE LOOKED WITHOUT LOVE UPON THE DAUGHTER OF BASTARDY SO NEAR HER IT WAS AN UNPLEASANT RESEMBLANCE JOSIANA HAD A RIGHT TO SAY TO ANNE MY MOTHER WAS AT LEAST AS GOOD AS YOURS AT COURT NO ONE SAID SO BUT THEY EVIDENTLY THOUGHT IT
6147-34607-0040 THIS WAS A BORE FOR HER ROYAL MAJESTY WHY THIS JOSIANA WHAT HAD PUT IT INTO HER HEAD TO BE BORN WHAT GOOD WAS A JOSIANA CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS ARE DETRIMENTAL
6563-285357-0000 THIS IMPERIAL APPRECIATION OF WHAT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED PROVED TO BE THE TURNING POINT IN THE INVENTOR'S FORTUNES IT STIMULATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THE SECOND AIRSHIP WAS TAKEN IN HAND BUT MISFORTUNE STILL PURSUED HIM
6563-285357-0001 ACCIDENTS WERE OF ALMOST DAILY OCCURRENCE DEFECTS WERE REVEALED HERE AND WEAKNESSES SOMEWHERE ELSE SO SOON AS ONE TROUBLE WAS OVERCOME ANOTHER MADE ITSELF MANIFEST THE RESULT WAS THAT THE WHOLE OF THE MONEY COLLECTED BY HIS HARD WORK
6563-285357-0002 WAS EXPENDED BEFORE THE SHIP COULD TAKE TO THE AIR A FURTHER CRASH AND BLASTING OF CHERISHED HOPES APPEARED IMMINENT BUT AT THIS MOMENT ANOTHER ROYAL PERSONAGE CAME TO THE INVENTOR'S AID THE KING OF WURTEMBERG
6563-285357-0003 TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIS SUBJECT'S UPHILL STRUGGLE AND THE WURTEMBERG GOVERNMENT GRANTED HIM THE PROCEEDS OF A LOTTERY WITH THIS MONEY AND WITH WHAT HE SUCCEEDED IN RAISING BY HOOK AND BY CROOK AND BY MORTGAGING HIS REMAINING PROPERTY
6563-285357-0004 AND IN NINETEEN O FIVE IT WAS LAUNCHED IT WAS A DISTINCT IMPROVEMENT UPON ITS PREDECESSORS THE AIRSHIP WAS FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN FEET IN LENGTH BY THIRTY EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER WAS EQUIPPED WITH SEVENTEEN GAS BALLOONS
6563-285357-0005 HAVING AN AGGREGATE CAPACITY OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND CUBIC FEET OF HYDROGEN WAS EQUIPPED WITH TWO EIGHTY FIVE HORSE POWER MOTORS DRIVING FOUR PROPELLERS AND DISPLACED NINE TONS ALL THE IMPERFECTIONS INCIDENTAL TO THE PREVIOUS CRAFT
6563-285357-0006 HAD BEEN ELIMINATED WHILE THE SHIP FOLLOWED IMPROVED LINES IN ITS MECHANICAL AND STRUCTURAL DETAILS THE TRIALS WITH THIS VESSEL COMMENCED ON NOVEMBER THIRTIETH NINETEEN O FIVE BUT ILL LUCK HAD NOT BEEN ELUDED
6563-285357-0007 THE AIRSHIP WAS MOORED UPON A RAFT WHICH WAS TO BE TOWED OUT INTO THE LAKE TO ENABLE THE DIRIGIBLE TO ASCEND BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH THE ARRANGEMENTS A STRONG WIND CAUGHT THE UNGAINLY AIRSHIP SHE DIPPED HER NOSE INTO THE WATER AND AS THE MOTOR WAS SET GOING
6563-285357-0008 SHE WAS DRIVEN DEEPER INTO THE LAKE THE VESSEL ONLY BEING SAVED BY HURRIED DEFLATION SIX WEEKS WERE OCCUPIED IN REPAIRS BUT ANOTHER ASCENT WAS MADE ON JANUARY SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN O SIX THE TRIALS WERE FAIRLY SATISFACTORY
6563-285357-0009 BUT INCONCLUSIVE ONE OF THE MOTORS WENT WRONG AND THE LONGITUDINAL STABILITY WAS FOUND TO BE INDIFFERENT THE VESSEL WAS BROUGHT DOWN AND WAS TO BE ANCHORED BUT THE FATES RULED OTHERWISE A STRONG WIND CAUGHT HER DURING THE NIGHT
6563-285357-0010 AND SHE WAS SPEEDILY REDUCED TO INDISTINGUISHABLE SCRAP DESPITE CATASTROPHE THE INVENTOR WRESTLED GAMELY WITH HIS PROJECT THE LESSONS TAUGHT BY ONE DISASTER WERE TAKEN TO HEART
6563-285357-0011 AND ARRANGEMENTS TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE THEREOF INCORPORATED IN THE SUCCEEDING CRAFT UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER AS SOON AS ONE DEFECT WAS REMEDIED ANOTHER ASSERTED ITSELF IT WAS THIS PERSISTENT REVELATION OF THE UNEXPECTED
6563-285357-0012 WHICH CAUSED ANOTHER PERIOD OF INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS HIS INVENTION PROBABLY NOTHING MORE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARD OF THE ZEPPELIN AFTER THIS LAST ACCIDENT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTERVENTION OF THE PRUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE DIRECT INSTIGATION OF THE KAISER
6563-285357-0013 WHO HAD NOW TAKEN COUNT ZEPPELIN UNDER HIS WING A STATE LOTTERY WAS INAUGURATED THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE HANDED OVER TO THE INDEFATIGABLE INVENTOR TOGETHER WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT IF HE COULD KEEP ALOFT TWENTY FOUR HOURS WITHOUT COMING TO EARTH IN THE MEANTIME
6563-285357-0014 AND COULD COVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILES WITHIN THIS PERIOD THE GOVERNMENT WOULD REPAY THE WHOLE OF THE MONEY HE HAD LAVISHED UPON HIS IDEA AND LIQUIDATE ALL THE DEBTS HE HAD INCURRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH ANOTHER CRAFT WAS BUILT LARGER THAN ITS PREDECESSORS
6563-285357-0015 AND EQUIPPED WITH TWO MOTORS DEVELOPING ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY HORSE POWER UPON COMPLETION IT WAS SUBMITTED TO SEVERAL PRELIMINARY FLIGHTS WHICH WERE SO EMINENTLY SUCCESSFUL THAT THE INVENTOR DECIDED TO MAKE A TRIAL TRIP UNDER CONDITIONS CLOSELY ANALOGOUS
6563-285357-0016 TO THOSE IMPOSED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TEST ON JUNE TWENTIETH NINETEEN O EIGHT AT EIGHT TWENTY SIX A M THE CRAFT ASCENDED AND REMAINED ALOFT FOR TWELVE HOURS DURING WHICH TIME IT MADE AN ENCOURAGING CIRCULAR TOUR FLUSHED WITH THIS SUCCESS
6563-285357-0017 THE COUNT CONSIDERED THAT THE OFFICIAL AWARD WAS WITHIN REACH AND THAT ALL HIS PREVIOUS DISASTERS AND MISFORTUNES WERE ON THE EVE OF REDEMPTION THE CRUCIAL TEST WAS ESSAYED ON AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN O EIGHT ACCOMPANIED BY TWELVE OBSERVERS
6563-285357-0018 THE VESSEL ASCENDED AND TRAVELLED WITHOUT INCIDENT FOR EIGHT HOURS THEN A SLIGHT MISHAP DEMANDED ATTENTION BUT WAS SPEEDILY REPAIRED AND WAS IGNORED OFFICIALLY AS BEING TOO TRIVIAL TO INFLUENCE THE MAIN ISSUE VICTORY APPEARED WITHIN
6563-285357-0019 MEASURABLE DISTANCE THE ARDUOUS TOIL OF MANY PATIENT YEARS WAS ABOUT TO BE REWARDED THE AIRSHIP WAS WITHIN SIGHT OF HOME WHEN IT HAD TO DESCEND OWING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANOTHER MOTOR FAULT BUT AS IT APPROACHED THE GROUND NATURE
6563-285357-0020 AS IF INFURIATED AT THE CONQUEST ROSE UP IN REBELLION A SUDDEN SQUALL STRUCK THE UNWIELDY MONSTER WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS IT BECAME UNMANAGEABLE AND THROUGH SOME INSCRUTABLE CAUSE IT CAUGHT FIRE WITH THE RESULT THAT WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS
6563-285357-0021 IT WAS REDUCED TO A TANGLED MASS OF METALLIC FRAMEWORK IT WAS A CATASTROPHE THAT WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY VANQUISHED MANY AN INVENTOR BUT THE COUNT WAS SAVED THE GALL OF DEFEAT HIS FLIGHT WHICH WAS REMARKABLE INASMUCH AS HE HAD COVERED THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES
6563-285357-0022 WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS INCLUDING TWO UNAVOIDABLE DESCENTS STRUCK THE TEUTON IMAGINATION THE SEEDS SO CAREFULLY PLANTED BY THE MOST HIGH OF PRUSSIA NOW BORE FRUIT THE GERMAN NATION SYMPATHISED WITH THE INDOMITABLE INVENTOR
6563-285357-0023 APPRECIATED HIS GENIUS AND PROMPTLY POURED FORTH A STREAM OF SUBSCRIPTIONS TO ENABLE HIM TO BUILD ANOTHER VESSEL THE INTIMATION THAT OTHER POWERS HAD APPROACHED THE COUNT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF HIS IDEA BECAME KNOWN FAR AND WIDE
6563-285357-0024 TOGETHER WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE HAD UNEQUIVOCALLY REFUSED ALL OFFERS HE WAS STRIVING FOR THE FATHERLAND
6563-285357-0025 HE COULD FORGE AHEAD UNTRAMMELLED BY ANXIETY AND WORRY ANOTHER ZEPPELIN WAS BUILT AND IT CREATED A WORLD'S RECORD IT REMAINED ALOFT FOR THIRTY EIGHT HOURS DURING WHICH TIME IT COVERED SIX HUNDRED NINETY MILES AND ALTHOUGH IT CAME TO GRIEF UPON ALIGHTING
6563-285357-0026 BY COLLIDING WITH A TREE THE FINAL INCIDENT PASSED UNNOTICED
6563-285357-0027 IT HAD AN AIRSHIP WHICH COULD GO ANYWHERE IRRESPECTIVE OF CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND IN TRUE TEUTON PERSPECTIVE THE CRAFT WAS VIEWED FROM THE MILITARY STANDPOINT HERE WAS A MEANS OF OBTAINING THE MASTERY OF THE AIR
6563-285357-0028 A FORMIDABLE ENGINE OF INVASION AND AERIAL ATTACK HAD BEEN PERFECTED CONSEQUENTLY THE GRAND IDEA MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH UNBOUNDED ENTHUSIASM THE COUNT WAS HAILED BY HIS AUGUST MASTER AS THE GREATEST GERMAN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
6563-285357-0029 AND IN THIS APPRECIATION THE POPULACE WHOLEHEARTEDLY CONCURRED WHETHER SUCH A PANEGYRIC FROM SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS QUARTER IS PRAISE INDEED OR THE EQUIVALENT OF COMPLETE CONDEMNATION HISTORY ALONE WILL BE ABLE TO JUDGE
6563-285357-0030 BUT WHEN ONE REFLECTS AT THIS MOMENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS AIRCRAFT DURING THE PRESENT CONFLAGRATION THE UNPREJUDICED WILL BE RATHER INCLINED TO HAZARD THE OPINION THAT IMPERIAL TEUTON PRAISE IS A SYNONYM FOR DAMNATION
6563-285357-0031 ALTHOUGH THE ZEPPELIN WAS ACCEPTED AS A PERFECT MACHINE IT HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE TO DISPERSE THE ATMOSPHERE OF DISASTER WITH WHICH IT HAS BEEN ENVELOPED FROM THE FIRST VESSEL AFTER VESSEL HAS GONE UP IN SMOKE AND FLAME FEW CRAFT OF THIS TYPE
6563-285357-0032 HAVE ENJOYED MORE THAN AN EVANESCENT EXISTENCE
6563-285357-0033 THAN ITS PREDECESSOR BUT THE TEUTONIC NATION HAS BEEN INDUCED TO PIN ITS WHOLE FAITH ON THIS AIRSHIP NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE MORE LEVELHEADED ENGINEERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THE CRAFT TO BE A MECHANICAL MONSTROSITY CONDEMNED FROM ITS DESIGN
6563-285357-0034 AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTION TO DISASTER UNSHAKEN BY THIS ADVERSE CRITICISM GERMANY RESTS ASSURED THAT BY MEANS OF ITS ZEPPELINS IT WILL ACHIEVE THAT UNIVERSAL SUPREMACY WHICH IT IS CONVINCED IS ITS DESTINY
6563-285357-0035 THIS BLIND CHILD LIKE FAITH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ZEPPELIN FACTORIES AT FRIEDRICHSHAFEN THE FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO PRODUCE TWO OF THESE VESSELS PER MONTH WHILE ANOTHER FACTORY OF A SIMILAR CAPACITY
6563-285357-0036 HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT BERLIN UNFORTUNATELY SUCH BIG CRAFT DEMAND LARGE DOCKS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM AND IN TURN A LARGE STRUCTURE OF THIS CHARACTER CONSTITUTES AN EASY MARK FOR HOSTILE ATTACK AS THE RAIDING AIRMEN OF THE ALLIES HAVE
6563-285357-0037 PROVED VERY CONVINCINGLY BUT THE ZEPPELIN MUST NOT BE UNDER RATED MAGNIFICENT PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN RECORDED BY THESE VESSELS SUCH AS THE ROUND ONE THOUSAND MILES TRIP IN NINETEEN O NINE AND SEVERAL OTHER
6563-285357-0038 EQUALLY BRILLIANT FEATS SINCE THAT DATE IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT EACH ASTOUNDING ACHIEVEMENT HAS BEEN ATTENDED BY AN EQUALLY STUPENDOUS ACCIDENT BUT THAT IS ACCEPTED AS A MERE INCIDENTAL DETAIL BY THE FAITHFUL TEUTONIC NATION
6563-285357-0039 MANY VIVID PROPHECIES OF THE FORTHCOMING FLIGHTS BY ZEPPELIN HAVE BEEN UTTERED AND IT IS QUITE PROBABLE THAT MORE THAN ONE WILL BE FULFILLED BUT SUCCESS WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE RATHER TO ACCIDENT THAN DESIGN
6563-285357-0040 ALTHOUGH THE ZEPPELIN IS THE MAIN STAKE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE IN MATTERS PERTAINING TO AERIAL CONQUEST OTHER TYPES OF AIRSHIPS HAVE NOT BEEN IGNORED AS RELATED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER THEY HAVE BEEN FOSTERED UPON A SMALLER BUT EQUALLY EFFECTIVE SCALE
6563-285357-0041 GROSS CRAFT HAVE MET WITH WHOLE HEARTED SUPPORT SINCE THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR VALUE AS VESSELS OF THE AIR WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR MILITARY VALUE THE PARSEVAL IS PRONOUNCED BY EXPERTS TO BE THE FINEST EXPRESSION OF AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING
6563-285357-0042 SO FAR AS TEUTON EFFORT IS CONCERNED CERTAINLY IT HAS PLACED MANY NOTABLE FLIGHTS TO ITS CREDIT THE GROSS AIRSHIP IS AN EQUALLY SERVICEABLE CRAFT
6563-285357-0043 CLOSELY FOLLOWING THOSE OF THE EARLY FRENCH SUPPLE AIRSHIPS THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER CRAFT WHICH HAVE BECOME MORE OR LESS RECOGNISED BY THE GERMAN NATION AS SUBSTANTIAL UNITS OF WAR SUCH AS THE RUTHEMBERG SIEMENS SCHUKERT AND SO FORTH
6563-285357-0044 ALL OF WHICH HAVE PROVED THEIR SERVICEABILITY MORE OR LESS CONCLUSIVELY
6563-63821-0000 PETER FORCE ONE OF THE INTERESTING SIGHTS OF THE CITY OF WASHINGTON USED TO BE THE LIBRARY OF OLD PETER FORCE AS HE WAS FAMILIARLY CALLED COLONEL PETER FORCE AS HE WAS MORE PROPERLY STYLED
6563-63821-0001 HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW COLONELS OF THAT DAY WHO HAD ACTUALLY HELD A COLONEL'S COMMAND HAVING BEEN REGULARLY COMMISSIONED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS A COLONEL OF ARTILLERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HE MIGHT INDEED HAVE BEEN CALLED MAJOR GENERAL
6563-63821-0002 FOR IN HIS OLD AGE HE HELD THAT RANK IN THE MILITIA OF THE DISTRICT AND A VERY FINE LOOKING SOLDIER HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HIS PRIME JUDGING FROM THE PORTRAIT WHICH USED TO HANG IN THE LIBRARY REPRESENTING A FULL FORMED MAN TALL AND ERECT
6563-63821-0003 HIS HANDSOME AND BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE SET OFF BY AN ABUNDANCE OF CURLY HAIR HIS LIBRARY HAD ABOUT THE ROUGHEST FURNITURE EVER SEEN IN AN APARTMENT CONTAINING SO MUCH THAT WAS VALUABLE AS I REMEMBER IT IT WAS A LONG LOW ROOM
6563-63821-0004 WITH STREETS AND CROSS STREETS OF PINE BOOK SHELVES UNPAINTED ALL FILLED WITH BOOKS TO THEIR UTMOST CAPACITY A WILDERNESS OF BOOKS IN PRINT AND IN MANUSCRIPT MOSTLY OLD AND DINGY
6563-63821-0005 AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM RELATING IN SOME WAY TO AMERICAN HISTORY THE PLACE HAD A VERY MUSTY SMELL AND AS MOST OF ITS TREASURES WERE IN THE ORIGINAL BINDINGS OR WITHOUT BINDINGS FEW PERSONS WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED THE PRICELESS VALUE OF THE COLLECTION
6563-63821-0006 I AM ACQUAINTED WITH A CERTAIN LIBRARY IN NEW YORK OF SEVERAL THOUSAND VOLUMES MOST OF WHICH ARE BOUND RESPLENDENTLY IN CALF AND GOLD AND THE ROOM IN WHICH THEY ARE KEPT IS AS SPLENDID AS A STEAMBOAT
6563-63821-0007 BUT OLD PETER FORCE COULD SHOW YOU SINGLE ALCOVES OF HIS LIBRARY WHICH AT A FAIR VALUATION WOULD BUY OUT ALL THAT MASS OF SUMPTUOSITY IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS DUSTY DINGY WILDERNESS
6563-63821-0008 HE WOULD TAKE PLEASURE IN EXHIBITING HIS TREASURES HE WOULD TAKE DOWN HIS EXCELLENT COPY OF ELIOT'S INDIAN BIBLE A BOOK SO FAITHFULLY MADE IN EVERY RESPECT THAT I QUESTION IF AS A MERE PIECE OF BOOK MAKING
6563-63821-0009 IT COULD NOW BE MATCHED IN THE UNITED STATES HE LIVED TO SEE THIS RARITY COMMAND IN NEW YORK THE PRICE OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS HE WOULD SHOW YOU FORTY ONE WORKS IN THE ORIGINAL EDITIONS OF INCREASE AND COTTON MATHER
6563-63821-0010 THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE HE POSSESSED A LARGE NUMBER OF BOOKS PRINTED AND BOUND BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HE HAD TWO HUNDRED VOLUMES OF THE RECORDS OF COLONIAL LEGISLATURES
6563-63821-0011 HE COULD SHOW YOU A NEWSPAPER OF ALMOST EVERY MONTH NAY ALMOST EVERY WEEK SINCE NEWSPAPERS WERE FIRST PUBLISHED IN AMERICA HE HAD IN ALL NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOUND VOLUMES OF NEWSPAPERS OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE VOLUMES
6563-63821-0012 HE WOULD SHOW YOU A COLLECTION OF MORE THAN THIRTY NINE THOUSAND PAMPHLETS OF WHICH EIGHT THOUSAND WERE PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HIS COLLECTION OF MAPS RELATING TO AMERICA WAS TRULY WONDERFUL BESIDES ALL THE EARLY ATLASES OF ANY NOTE
6563-63821-0013 HE HAD OVER A THOUSAND DETACHED MAPS ILLUSTRATIVE BOTH OF THE GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY OF AMERICA FOR MANY OF THEM WERE MAPS AND PLANS DRAWN FOR MILITARY PURPOSES HE WOULD SHOW YOU PERHAPS
6563-63821-0014 A PEN DRAWING OF DATE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE BY A BRITISH OFFICER UPON WHICH WAS WRITTEN PLAN OF THE REBEL WORKS AT WEST POINT HE HAD ALSO SEVERAL PLANS BY BRITISH OFFICERS OF THE REBEL WORKS AROUND BOSTON DURING THE REVOLUTION
6563-63821-0015 BESIDES SUCH THINGS AND HE HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED PLANS AND MAPS OF WHICH THERE WAS NO OTHER COPY IN EXISTENCE HE POSSESSED A SURPRISING NUMBER OF BOOKS PRINTED IN THE INFANCY OF THE PRINTER'S ART AMONG THEM
6563-63821-0016 SPECIMENS REPRESENTING EVERY YEAR FROM FOURTEEN SIXTY SEVEN ONWARD HE HAD MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOOKS PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR SIXTEEN HUNDRED SO ARRANGED THAT A STUDENT COULD TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THE ART OF PRINTING FROM THE DAYS OF CAXTON
6563-63821-0017 HE HAD ALSO A VAST COLLECTION OF MANUSCRIPTS NUMBERING FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE VOLUMES
6563-63821-0018 THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOLUMES IN THE LIBRARY WAS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE AND THE NUMBER OF PAMPHLETS NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND THE READER PERHAPS IMAGINES THAT THE COLLECTOR OF SUCH A LIBRARY MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY RICH MAN
6563-63821-0019 AND THAT HE TRAVELED FAR AND WIDE IN SEARCH OF THESE PRECIOUS OBJECTS NOT AT ALL HE NEVER WAS A RICH MAN AND I BELIEVE HE RARELY TRAVELED BEYOND THE SIGHT OF THE DOME OF THE CAPITOL INDEED THE MOST WONDERFUL THING ABOUT HIS COLLECTION WAS THAT HE
6563-63821-0020 WHO BEGAN LIFE A JOURNEYMAN PRINTER AND WAS NEVER IN THE RECEIPT OF A LARGE INCOME SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET TOGETHER SO VAST AN AMOUNT OF VALUABLE MATERIAL PART OF THE SECRET WAS THAT WHEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE HIS COLLECTION THESE THINGS WERE NOT VALUED
6563-63821-0021 AND HE OBTAINED MANY OF HIS MOST PRECIOUS RELICS BY MERELY TAKING THE TROUBLE TO CARRY THEM AWAY FROM THE GARRETS IN WHICH THEY WERE MOULDERING INTO DUST UNPRIZED AND UNKNOWN A WISE OLD NEW YORK MERCHANT LONG AGO HIMSELF MOULDERED INTO DUST
6563-63821-0022 USED TO SAY MEN GENERALLY GET IN THIS WORLD EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT HOW CAN THAT BE ASKED A YOUNGSTER ONE DAY
6563-63821-0023 BUT VERY FEW OF THEM EVER WILL BE I WANT A MILLION OR SO MYSELF AH BOY THE OLD MAN REPLIED YOU WANT A MILLION BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT ENOUGH WHAT YOU WANT AT PRESENT IS PLEASURE AND YOU WANT IT SO MUCH
6563-63821-0024 THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SPEND ALL YOUR SURPLUS FORCE TIME AND REVENUE TO GET IT IF YOU WANTED YOUR MILLION AS MUCH AS YOU WANT PLEASURE BY AND BY WHEN YOU HAVE A BALD HEAD LIKE MINE YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR MILLION
6563-63821-0025 PETER FORCE WAS A VERY GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THE OLD MERCHANT'S DOCTRINE HE GOT ALL THESE PRECIOUS THINGS BECAUSE HE WANTED THEM WITH A SUSTAINED PASSION OF DESIRE FOR HALF A CENTURY THERE NEVER WAS A TIME WHEN HE WOULD NOT HAVE GLADLY GOT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
6563-63821-0026 AND WALKED TEN MILES IN THE FACE OF A NORTHEASTERLY STORM TO GET A RARE PAMPHLET OF FOUR PAGES HE WAS A MISER OF SUCH THINGS BUT NO THAT WORD DOES NOT DESCRIBE HIM FOR ONE OF THE GREATEST PLEASURES OF HIS LIFE
6563-63821-0027 WAS TO COMMUNICATE HIS TREASURES TO OTHERS AND HE COMMUNICATED TO THE WHOLE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE BEST OF HIS COLLECTIONS IN MASSIVE VOLUMES OF AMERICAN ARCHIVES HE WAS A MISER ONLY IN THE STRENGTH OF HIS DESIRE MORE THAN ONCE HE SAID TO MISTER GEORGE W GREENE
6563-63821-0028 DID I HESITATE BETWEEN A BARREL OF FLOUR AND A RARE BOOK BUT THE BOOK ALWAYS GOT THE UPPER HAND TO THE SAME FRIEND HE MADE A REMARK WHICH SHOWS THAT HIS DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE WAS QUITE AS STRONG AS HIS DESIRE TO OBTAIN WHENEVER SAID HE
6563-63821-0029 I FOUND A LITTLE MORE MONEY IN MY PURSE THAN I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED I PUBLISHED A VOLUME OF HISTORICAL TRACTS IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THE OLD MAN RELATE HOW THIS TASTE FOR THE TREASURES OF HISTORY WAS FORMED IN HIS MIND HIS FATHER
6563-63821-0030 WHO SERVED DURING THE REVOLUTION IN A NEW JERSEY REGIMENT RETIRED AFTER THE WAR TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND AT HIS HOUSE THE JERSEY VETERANS LIKED TO MEET AND TALK OVER THE INCIDENTS OF THE CAMPAIGNS THEY HAD MADE TOGETHER PETER AS A BOY
6563-63821-0031 LOVED TO HEAR THEM TELL THEIR STORIES AND AS HE LISTENED THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM ONE EVENING WHY SHOULD ALL THIS BE FORGOTTEN BOY AS HE WAS HE BEGAN TO WRITE THEM DOWN UNDER THE TITLE OF THE UNWRITTEN HISTORY OF THE WAR IN NEW JERSEY
6563-63821-0032 HE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE MANUSCRIPT WAS LOST THE TASTE THEN FORMED GREW WITH HIS GROWTH AND STRENGTHENED WITH HIS STRENGTH AT TEN HE LEFT SCHOOL FOREVER AND WENT INTO A PRINTING OFFICE
6563-63821-0033 WHICH HAS PROVED AN EXCELLENT SCHOOL TO MORE THAN ONE VALUABLE AMERICAN MIND HE BECAME AN ACCOMPLISHED PRINTER AND AT TWENTY TWO WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK TYPOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY AN ORGANIZATION WHICH STILL EXISTS
6563-63821-0034 THEN THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE BEGAN LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM HE SERVED IN THE ARMY FIRST AS PRIVATE THEN AS SERGEANT THEN AS SERGEANT MAJOR THEN AS ENSIGN FINALLY AS LIEUTENANT THE WAR ENDED
6563-63821-0035 HE WENT TO WASHINGTON AS FOREMAN OF A PRINTING OFFICE AND AT WASHINGTON AS PRINTER EDITOR PUBLISHER AND COLLECTOR HE LIVED THE REST OF HIS LONG AND HONORABLE LIFE NEVER RICH AS I HAVE BEFORE REMARKED
6563-63821-0036 THOUGH NEVER WITHOUT A SHARE OF REASONABLE PROSPERITY THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK OF HIS LIFE WAS THE PUBLICATION OF THE AMERICAN ARCHIVES IN WHICH HE WAS AIDED BY CONGRESS HE FURNISHING THE DOCUMENTS AND THE LABOR
6563-63821-0037 AND CONGRESS PAYING THE COST OF PUBLICATION THROUGH THE NINE VOLUMES OF THIS WORK A GREAT NUMBER OF THE MOST CURIOUS AND INTERESTING RECORDS AND MEMORIALS OF AMERICAN HISTORY ARE NOT ONLY PRESERVED BUT MADE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS WHO CAN GET NEAR A LIBRARY
6563-63821-0038 HE HAD ALL THE STATE HOUSES OF THE COUNTRY RANSACKED FOR DOCUMENTS AND A ROOM WAS ASSIGNED HIM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN WHICH HIS CLERKS COULD CONVENIENTLY COPY THEM ALL WENT WELL WITH THE WORK UNTIL WILLIAM MARCY BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE
6563-63821-0039 WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO EXAMINE AND APPROVE EACH VOLUME BEFORE IT WENT TO THE PRINTER WHEN PETER FORCE PRESENTED THE MANUSCRIPT OF THE TENTH VOLUME TO SECRETARY MARCY HE RECEIVED A REBUFF WHICH THREW A CLOUD OVER SEVERAL YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6563-63821-0040 I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR WORK SIR SAID THE SECRETARY IT IS OF NO USE TO ANYBODY I NEVER READ A PAGE OF IT AND NEVER EXPECT TO BUT SAID MISTER FORCE THE WORK IS PUBLISHED IN VIRTUE OF A CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT
6563-63821-0041 HERE IS THE MANUSCRIPT OF THE TENTH VOLUME IF THERE IS ANYTHING THERE WHICH YOU THINK OUGHT NOT TO BE THERE HAVE THE GOODNESS TO POINT IT OUT TO ME YOU MAY LEAVE THE PAPERS SIR SAID THE SECRETARY HE LEFT THE PAPERS
6563-63821-0042 BUT NEITHER MARCY NOR HIS SUCCESSORS EVER FOUND TIME TO EXAMINE THAT TENTH VOLUME THOUGH ON THE FIRST DAY OF EVERY OFFICIAL YEAR THE COMPILER CALLED THEIR ATTENTION TO IT FOR SEVEN YEARS HE WAS A SUITOR ON BEHALF OF HIS BELOVED TENTH VOLUME
6563-63821-0043 AND THEN THE WAR OCCURRED AND ALL SUCH MATTERS WERE NECESSARILY PUT ASIDE HE WAS NOW SEVENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE AND HIS GREAT DESIRE WAS TO DISPOSE OF HIS LIBRARY IN SUCH A WAY THAT ITS TREASURES WOULD NOT BE SCATTERED ABROAD
6563-63821-0044 AND PERHAPS LOST FOREVER TO THE COUNTRY AT LENGTH CONGRESS HAVING SANCTIONED THE ENLARGEMENT OF THEIR OWN LIBRARY THEIR LIBRARIAN MISTER SPOFFORD INDUCED THEM TO PURCHASE THE WHOLE MASS JUST AS IT STOOD
6563-63821-0045 FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE COLLECTION NOW FORMS PART OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY COLONEL FORCE LIVED TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHEN HE DIED AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSALLY BELOVED AND LAMENTED
6563-63821-0046 IN THE SEVENTY EIGHTH YEAR OF HIS AGE ENJOYING ALMOST TO THE LAST TWO OF THE THINGS HE LOVED BEST HIS BOOKS
7312-92432-0000 MAY TEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE MADAME
7312-92432-0001 IN COMPLIANCE WITH YOUR REQUEST I HAVE THE HONOR TO STATE SUCCINCTLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH MY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE LATE MADAME OSSOLI YOUR DECEASED SISTER DURING HER RESIDENCE IN ROME
7312-92432-0002 IN THE MONTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE ROME AS YOU ARE NO DOUBT AWARE WAS PLACED IN A STATE OF SIEGE BY THE APPROACH OF THE FRENCH ARMY IT WAS FILLED AT THAT TIME WITH EXILES AND FUGITIVES
7312-92432-0003 WHO HAD BEEN CONTENDING FOR YEARS FROM MILAN IN THE NORTH TO PALERMO IN THE SOUTH FOR THE REPUBLICAN CAUSE AND WHEN THE GATES WERE CLOSED IT WAS COMPUTED THAT THERE WERE OF ITALIANS ALONE THIRTEEN THOUSAND REFUGEES WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE CITY
7312-92432-0004 ALL OF WHOM HAD BEEN EXPELLED FROM ADJACENT STATES TILL ROME BECAME THEIR LAST RALLYING POINT AND TO MANY THEIR FINAL RESTING PLACE AMONG THESE WAS TO BE SEEN EVERY VARIETY OF AGE SENTIMENT AND CONDITION
7312-92432-0005 STRIPLINGS AND BLANCHED HEADS WILD VISIONARY ENTHUSIASTS GRAVE HEROIC MEN WHO IN THE STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM HAD VENTURED ALL AND LOST ALL NOBLES AND BEGGARS BANDITS FELONS AND BRIGANDS GREAT EXCITEMENT NATURALLY EXISTED
7312-92432-0006 AND IN THE GENERAL APPREHENSION WHICH PERVADED ALL CLASSES THAT ACTS OF PERSONAL VIOLENCE AND OUTRAGE WOULD SOON BE COMMITTED THE FOREIGN RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY FOUND THEMSELVES PLACED IN AN ALARMING SITUATION
7312-92432-0007 ON THE THIRTIETH OF APRIL THE FIRST ENGAGEMENT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN THE FRENCH AND ROMAN TROOPS AND IN A FEW DAYS SUBSEQUENTLY I VISITED SEVERAL OF MY COUNTRYMEN AT THEIR REQUEST TO CONCERT MEASURES FOR THEIR SAFETY HEARING ON THAT OCCASION AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
7312-92432-0008 AND OF HER SOLITARY MODE OF LIFE I VENTURED TO CALL UPON HER AND OFFER MY SERVICES IN ANY MANNER THAT MIGHT CONDUCE TO HER COMFORT AND SECURITY SHE RECEIVED ME WITH MUCH KINDNESS AND THUS AN ACQUAINTANCE COMMENCED
7312-92432-0009 HER RESIDENCE ON THE PIAZZI BARBERINI BEING CONSIDERED AN INSECURE ABODE
7312-92432-0010 WHICH WAS OCCUPIED BY SEVERAL AMERICAN FAMILIES IN THE ENGAGEMENTS WHICH SUCCEEDED BETWEEN THE ROMAN AND FRENCH TROOPS THE WOUNDED OF THE FORMER WERE BROUGHT INTO THE CITY AND DISPOSED THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT HOSPITALS WHICH WERE UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF SEVERAL LADIES OF HIGH RANK
7312-92432-0011 WHO HAD FORMED THEMSELVES INTO ASSOCIATIONS THE BETTER TO ENSURE CARE AND ATTENTION TO THOSE UNFORTUNATE MEN MISS FULLER TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THIS NOBLE WORK AND THE GREATER PORTION OF HER TIME DURING THE ENTIRE SIEGE
7312-92432-0012 WHICH WAS PLACED UNDER HER DIRECTION IN ATTENDANCE UPON ITS INMATES THE WEATHER WAS INTENSELY HOT HER HEALTH WAS FEEBLE AND DELICATE THE DEAD AND DYING WERE AROUND HER IN EVERY STAGE OF PAIN AND HORROR BUT SHE NEVER SHRANK FROM THE DUTY SHE HAD ASSUMED
7312-92432-0013 HER HEART AND SOUL WERE IN THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THOSE MEN HAD FOUGHT AND ALL WAS DONE THAT WOMAN COULD DO TO COMFORT THEM IN THEIR SUFFERINGS I HAVE SEEN THE EYES OF THE DYING AS SHE MOVED AMONG THEM EXTENDED ON OPPOSITE BEDS MEET IN COMMENDATION OF HER UNIVERSAL KINDNESS
7312-92432-0014 AND I HAVE HEARD MANY OF THOSE WHO RECOVERED SPEAK WITH ALL THE PASSIONATE FERVOR OF THE ITALIAN NATURE
7312-92432-0015 THROUGHOUT THEIR LONG ILLNESS FULFILLED ALL THE OFFICES OF LOVE AND AFFECTION MAZZINI THE CHIEF OF THE TRIUMVIRATE WHO BETTER THAN ANY MAN IN ROME KNEW HER WORTH OFTEN EXPRESSED TO ME HIS ADMIRATION OF HER HIGH CHARACTER AND THE PRINCESS BELGIOJOSO
7312-92432-0016 TO WHOM WAS ASSIGNED THE CHARGE OF THE PAPAL PALACE ON THE QUIRINAL WHICH WAS CONVERTED ON THIS OCCASION INTO A HOSPITAL WAS ENTHUSIASTIC IN HER PRAISE AND IN A LETTER WHICH I RECEIVED NOT LONG SINCE FROM THIS LADY
7312-92432-0017 WHO WAS GAINING THE BREAD OF AN EXILE BY TEACHING LANGUAGES IN CONSTANTINOPLE SHE ALLUDES WITH MUCH FEELING TO THE SUPPORT AFFORDED BY MISS FULLER TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN ITALY HERE IN ROME SHE IS STILL SPOKEN OF IN TERMS OF REGARD AND ENDEARMENT
7312-92432-0018 AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HER DEATH WAS RECEIVED WITH A DEGREE OF SORROW NOT OFTEN BESTOWED UPON A FOREIGNER ESPECIALLY ONE OF A DIFFERENT FAITH ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF JUNE
7312-92432-0019 SHELLS AND GRENADES FALLING IN EVERY PART OF THE CITY IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE THIRTIETH I RECEIVED A BRIEF NOTE FROM MISS FULLER REQUESTING ME TO CALL AT HER RESIDENCE I DID SO WITHOUT DELAY AND FOUND HER LYING ON A SOFA PALE AND TREMBLING EVIDENTLY MUCH EXHAUSTED
7312-92432-0020 SHE INFORMED ME THAT SHE HAD SENT FOR ME TO PLACE IN MY HAND A PACKET OF IMPORTANT PAPERS WHICH SHE WISHED ME TO KEEP FOR THE PRESENT AND IN THE EVENT OF HER DEATH TO TRANSMIT IT TO HER FRIENDS IN THE UNITED STATES SHE THEN STATED THAT SHE WAS MARRIED TO MARQUIS OSSOLI
7312-92432-0021 WHO WAS IN COMMAND OF A BATTERY ON THE PINCIAN HILL THAT BEING THE HIGHEST AND MOST EXPOSED POSITION IN ROME AND DIRECTLY IN THE LINE OF BOMBS FROM THE FRENCH CAMP IT WAS NOT TO BE EXPECTED SHE SAID THAT HE COULD ESCAPE THE DANGERS OF ANOTHER NIGHT SUCH AS THE LAST
7312-92432-0022 AND THEREFORE IT WAS HER INTENTION TO REMAIN WITH HIM AND SHARE HIS FATE AT THE AVE MARIA SHE ADDED HE WOULD COME FOR HER AND THEY WOULD PROCEED TOGETHER TO HIS POST THE PACKET WHICH SHE PLACED IN MY POSSESSION CONTAINED SHE SAID THE CERTIFICATES OF HER MARRIAGE
7312-92432-0023 AND OF THE BIRTH AND BAPTISM OF HER CHILD AFTER A FEW WORDS MORE I TOOK MY DEPARTURE THE HOUR SHE NAMED HAVING NEARLY ARRIVED AT THE PORTER'S LODGE I MET THE MARQUIS OSSOLI
7312-92432-0024 HAPPILY THE CANNONADING WAS NOT RENEWED THAT NIGHT AND AT DAWN OF DAY SHE RETURNED TO HER APARTMENTS WITH HER HUSBAND BY HER SIDE ON THAT DAY THE FRENCH ARMY ENTERED ROME AND THE GATES BEING OPENED MADAME OSSOLI ACCOMPANIED BY THE MARQUIS
7312-92432-0025 FORMERLY IN THE SERVICE OF THE OSSOLI FAMILY SHE REMAINED AS YOU ARE NO DOUBT AWARE SOME MONTHS AT RIETI WHENCE SHE REMOVED TO FLORENCE WHERE SHE RESIDED UNTIL HER ILL FATED DEPARTURE FOR THE UNITED STATES
78-368-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN WE LANDED WE WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME ON THE SHORE ENJOYING THE TRANSITORY LIGHT AND THEN RETIRED TO THE INN
78-368-0001 THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE WEST THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS BEGINNING TO DESCEND
78-368-0002 THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THE FLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THE SCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVES
78-368-0003 THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
78-368-0004 AND NOT SHRINK FROM THE CONFLICT UNTIL MY OWN LIFE OR THAT OF MY ADVERSARY WAS EXTINGUISHED ELIZABETH OBSERVED MY AGITATION FOR SOME TIME IN TIMID AND FEARFUL SILENCE
78-368-0005 WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A SHRILL AND DREADFUL SCREAM IT CAME FROM THE ROOM INTO WHICH ELIZABETH HAD RETIRED AS I HEARD IT THE WHOLE TRUTH RUSHED INTO MY MIND MY ARMS DROPPED THE MOTION OF EVERY MUSCLE AND FIBRE WAS SUSPENDED
78-368-0006 I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD TRICKLING IN MY VEINS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES OF MY LIMBS THIS STATE LASTED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
78-368-0007 GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
78-368-0008 SHE WAS THERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR EVERYWHERE I TURN I SEE THE SAME FIGURE HER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM
78-368-0009 FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
78-368-0010 BUT THE HORROR OF OTHERS APPEARED ONLY AS A MOCKERY A SHADOW OF THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESSED ME I ESCAPED FROM THEM
78-368-0011 TO THE ROOM WHERE LAY THE BODY OF ELIZABETH MY LOVE MY WIFE SO LATELY LIVING SO DEAR SO WORTHY SHE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE POSTURE IN WHICH I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER
78-368-0012 BUT THE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELD IN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIEND'S GRASP WAS ON HER NECK
78-368-0013 AND I FELT A KIND OF PANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BE DESCRIBED
78-368-0014 I SAW AT THE OPEN WINDOW A FIGURE THE MOST HIDEOUS AND ABHORRED A GRIN WAS ON THE FACE OF THE MONSTER HE SEEMED TO JEER AS WITH HIS FIENDISH FINGER HE POINTED TOWARDS THE CORPSE OF MY WIFE
78-368-0015 BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
78-368-0016 NETS WERE CAST BUT IN VAIN AFTER PASSING SEVERAL HOURS WE RETURNED HOPELESS
78-368-0017 AFTER HAVING LANDED THEY PROCEEDED TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY PARTIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AMONG THE WOODS AND VINES I ATTEMPTED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND PROCEEDED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE
78-368-0018 A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
78-368-0019 AS IF TO SEEK SOMETHING THAT I HAD LOST AFTER AN INTERVAL I AROSE AND AS IF BY INSTINCT CRAWLED INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE CORPSE OF MY BELOVED LAY THERE WERE WOMEN WEEPING AROUND I HUNG OVER IT
78-368-0020 AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NO DISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND
78-368-0021 SUBJECTS REFLECTING CONFUSEDLY ON MY MISFORTUNES AND THEIR CAUSE I WAS BEWILDERED IN A CLOUD OF WONDER AND HORROR THE DEATH OF WILLIAM THE EXECUTION OF JUSTINE
78-368-0022 THE MURDER OF CLERVAL AND LASTLY OF MY WIFE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW NOT THAT MY ONLY REMAINING FRIENDS WERE SAFE FROM THE MALIGNITY OF THE FIEND
78-368-0023 MY FATHER EVEN NOW MIGHT BE WRITHING UNDER HIS GRASP AND ERNEST MIGHT BE DEAD AT HIS FEET THIS IDEA MADE ME SHUDDER AND RECALLED ME TO ACTION
78-368-0024 THERE WERE NO HORSES TO BE PROCURED AND I MUST RETURN BY THE LAKE BUT THE WIND WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS
78-368-0025 HOWEVER IT WAS HARDLY MORNING AND I MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO ARRIVE BY NIGHT
78-368-0026 BUT NOTHING COULD APPEAR TO ME AS IT HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE A FIEND HAD SNATCHED FROM ME EVERY HOPE OF FUTURE HAPPINESS NO CREATURE HAD EVER BEEN SO MISERABLE AS I WAS SO FRIGHTFUL AN EVENT IS SINGLE IN THE HISTORY OF MAN
78-368-0027 BUT WHY SHOULD I DWELL UPON THE INCIDENTS THAT FOLLOWED THIS LAST OVERWHELMING EVENT MINE HAS BEEN A TALE OF HORRORS I HAVE REACHED THEIR ACME AND WHAT I MUST NOW RELATE
78-368-0028 KNOW THAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE MY OWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED
78-368-0029 AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
78-368-0030 MISERY ON HIS GREY HAIRS AND DOOMED HIM TO WASTE IN WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT LIVE UNDER THE HORRORS THAT WERE ACCUMULATED AROUND HIM THE SPRINGS OF EXISTENCE SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
78-368-0031 SOMETIMES INDEED I DREAMT THAT I WANDERED
78-368-0032 MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MY PRISON FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS I UNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION
78-368-0033 THE MONSTER WHOM I HAD CREATED THE MISERABLE DAEMON WHOM I HAD SENT ABROAD INTO THE WORLD FOR MY DESTRUCTION I WAS POSSESSED BY A MADDENING RAGE WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM
78-368-0034 AND DESIRED AND ARDENTLY PRAYED THAT I MIGHT HAVE HIM WITHIN MY GRASP TO WREAK A GREAT
78-368-0035 REVENGE ON HIS CURSED HEAD NOR DID MY HATE LONG CONFINE ITSELF TO USELESS WISHES I BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THE BEST MEANS OF SECURING HIM AND FOR THIS PURPOSE
78-368-0036 AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN ACCUSATION TO MAKE THAT I KNEW THE DESTROYER OF MY FAMILY AND THAT I REQUIRED HIM TO EXERT HIS WHOLE AUTHORITY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE MURDERER
78-368-0037 HOWEVER WONDERFUL FORCES CONVICTION THE STORY IS TOO CONNECTED TO BE MISTAKEN FOR A DREAM AND I HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR FALSEHOOD
78-368-0038 MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
78-368-0039 AND THIS PURPOSE QUIETED MY AGONY AND FOR AN INTERVAL RECONCILED ME TO LIFE I NOW RELATED MY HISTORY BRIEFLY BUT WITH FIRMNESS AND PRECISION MARKING THE DATES WITH ACCURACY
78-368-0040 AND NEVER DEVIATING INTO INVECTIVE OR EXCLAMATION THE MAGISTRATE APPEARED AT FIRST PERFECTLY INCREDULOUS BUT AS I CONTINUED HE BECAME MORE ATTENTIVE AND INTERESTED
78-368-0041 WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED MY NARRATION I SAID THIS IS THE BEING WHOM I ACCUSE AND FOR WHOSE SEIZURE AND PUNISHMENT I CALL UPON YOU TO EXERT YOUR WHOLE POWER
78-368-0042 FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION
78-368-0043 I WOULD WILLINGLY AFFORD YOU EVERY AID IN YOUR PURSUIT BUT THE CREATURE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK APPEARS TO HAVE POWERS WHICH WOULD PUT ALL MY EXERTIONS TO DEFIANCE
78-368-0044 WHO CAN FOLLOW AN ANIMAL WHICH CAN TRAVERSE THE SEA OF ICE AND INHABIT CAVES AND DENS WHERE NO MAN WOULD VENTURE TO INTRUDE
78-368-0045 SINCE THE COMMISSION OF HIS CRIMES AND NO ONE CAN CONJECTURE TO WHAT PLACE HE HAS WANDERED OR WHAT REGION HE MAY NOW INHABIT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOVERS NEAR THE SPOT WHICH I INHABIT
78-368-0046 AND IF HE HAS INDEED TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ALPS HE MAY BE HUNTED LIKE THE CHAMOIS AND DESTROYED AS A BEAST OF PREY BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS YOU DO NOT CREDIT MY NARRATIVE
78-368-0047 AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
78-368-0048 I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IF IT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFER PUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU
78-368-0049 HAVE YOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVE IMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CANNOT BE
78-368-0050 BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
78-368-0051 MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION
78-368-0052 I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZY IN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESS WHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED
78-368-0053 HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OF WISDOM CEASE
78-369-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP AND LOST I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY
78-369-0001 MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
78-369-0002 I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
78-369-0003 ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
78-369-0004 AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR
78-369-0005 UNCERTAIN WHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHER REPOSED I ENTERED IT
78-369-0006 AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIR GRAVES EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICH WERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN
78-369-0007 AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTED OBSERVER THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND
78-369-0008 THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH
78-369-0009 ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THE DEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THE SPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE DAEMON
78-369-0010 WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
78-369-0011 DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOW TORMENTS ME I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED ME THAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS
78-369-0012 HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUT THE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE
78-369-0013 IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS RE ECHOED IT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER
78-369-0014 AND THAT I WAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELL KNOWN AND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR
78-369-0015 I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVIL ELUDED MY GRASP
78-369-0016 SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
78-369-0017 SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME
78-369-0018 THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN
78-369-0019 WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT
78-369-0020 THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
78-369-0021 AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
78-369-0022 I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURING SLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY O BLESSED SLEEP
78-369-0023 OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
78-369-0024 DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER
78-369-0025 HEARD THE SILVER TONES OF MY ELIZABETH'S VOICE AND BEHELD CLERVAL ENJOYING HEALTH AND YOUTH OFTEN WHEN WEARIED BY A TOILSOME MARCH I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I WAS DREAMING UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD COME
78-369-0026 AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONIZING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM
78-369-0027 AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
78-369-0028 AS THE MECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THE ARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW
78-369-0029 THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
78-369-0030 WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE
78-369-0031 AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
78-369-0032 THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
78-369-0033 AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS
78-369-0034 ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
78-369-0035 WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTING HATRED MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS
78-369-0036 AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON
78-369-0037 OH HOW UNLIKE IT WAS TO THE BLUE SEASONS OF THE SOUTH COVERED WITH ICE IT WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM LAND BY ITS SUPERIOR WILDNESS AND RUGGEDNESS
78-369-0038 THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN
78-369-0039 AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY'S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM
78-369-0040 SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUS TRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED
78-369-0041 AND I HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH WITH NEW COURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHED HAMLET ON THE SEASHORE I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS
78-369-0042 CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE
78-369-0043 THROUGH FEAR OF HIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTER FOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON A NUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS
78-369-0044 HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED
78-369-0045 AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT
78-369-0046 MY RAGE AND VENGEANCE RETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVERED ROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE
78-369-0047 I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
78-369-0048 WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION BUT AGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE
78-369-0049 I SHOULD GUESS THAT I HAD PASSED THREE WEEKS IN THIS JOURNEY AND THE CONTINUAL PROTRACTION OF HOPE RETURNING BACK UPON THE HEART OFTEN WRUNG BITTER DROPS OF DESPONDENCY AND GRIEF FROM MY EYES
78-369-0050 DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL
78-369-0051 GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
78-369-0052 WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN I DISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELL KNOWN FORM WITHIN
78-369-0053 WARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE DAEMON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WAS DIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL
78-369-0054 WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
78-369-0055 MY HEART BOUNDED WITHIN ME BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
78-369-0056 AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
78-369-0057 AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH
78-369-0058 SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR
78-369-0059 I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP
78-369-0060 BUT YOUR DIRECTION WAS NORTHWARDS YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD WHEN MY VIGOUR WAS EXHAUSTED AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK UNDER MY MULTIPLIED HARDSHIPS INTO A DEATH WHICH I STILL DREAD FOR MY TASK IS UNFULFILLED
78-369-0061 OH WHEN WILL MY GUIDING SPIRIT IN CONDUCTING ME TO THE DAEMON ALLOW ME THE REST I SO MUCH DESIRE OR MUST I DIE AND HE YET LIVE IF I DO
78-369-0062 SWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIM AND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE NO
78-369-0063 SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN AGONY HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS TALE AT OTHERS HIS VOICE BROKEN YET PIERCING UTTERED WITH DIFFICULTY THE WORDS SO REPLETE WITH ANGUISH
8108-274318-0000 IT ALL SEEMED SO RAPID AND UNCALCULATED AFTER THAT THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN THIS LITTLE MODERN ROOM AT THE TOP OF PUTNEY HILL BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND SUNRISE THAT DOCTOR SILENCE WAS HARDLY ABLE TO FOLLOW AND REMEMBER IT ALL
8108-274318-0001 IT CAME ABOUT WITH SUCH UNCANNY SWIFTNESS AND TERROR THE LIGHT WAS SO UNCERTAIN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BLACK CAT SO DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW ON THE DARK CARPET AND THE DOCTOR HIMSELF SO WEARY AND TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT HE FOUND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
8108-274318-0002 TO OBSERVE ACCURATELY OR TO RECALL AFTERWARDS PRECISELY WHAT IT WAS HE HAD SEEN OR IN WHAT ORDER THE INCIDENTS HAD TAKEN PLACE HE NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT DEFECT OF VISION ON HIS PART MADE IT SEEM AS THOUGH THE CAT HAD DUPLICATED ITSELF AT FIRST
8108-274318-0003 AND THEN INCREASED INDEFINITELY SO THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST A DOZEN OF THEM DARTING SILENTLY ABOUT THE FLOOR LEAPING SOFTLY ON TO CHAIRS AND TABLES PASSING LIKE SHADOWS FROM THE OPEN DOOR TO THE END OF THE ROOM ALL BLACK AS SIN
8108-274318-0004 WITH BRILLIANT GREEN EYES FLASHING FIRE IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS LIKE THE REFLECTIONS FROM A SCORE OF MIRRORS PLACED ROUND THE WALLS AT DIFFERENT ANGLES NOR COULD HE MAKE OUT AT THE TIME WHY THE SIZE OF THE ROOM SEEMED TO HAVE ALTERED
8108-274318-0005 THE SNARLING OF THE ENRAGED AND TERRIFIED COLLIE SOUNDED SOMETIMES SO FAR AWAY THE CEILING SEEMED TO HAVE RAISED ITSELF SO MUCH HIGHER THAN BEFORE AND MUCH OF THE FURNITURE HAD CHANGED IN APPEARANCE AND SHIFTED MARVELLOUSLY IT WAS ALL SO CONFUSED AND CONFUSING
8108-274318-0006 INTO THE DIMENSIONS OF QUITE ANOTHER CHAMBER THAT CAME TO HIM WITH ITS HOST OF CATS AND ITS STRANGE DISTANCES IN A SORT OF VISION BUT THESE CHANGES CAME ABOUT A LITTLE LATER AND AT A TIME WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS SO CONCENTRATED
8108-274318-0007 UPON THE PROCEEDINGS OF SMOKE AND THE COLLIE THAT HE ONLY OBSERVED THEM AS IT WERE SUBCONSCIOUSLY AND THE EXCITEMENT THE FLICKERING CANDLELIGHT THE DISTRESS HE FELT FOR THE COLLIE
8108-274318-0008 WERE THE POOREST POSSIBLE ALLIES TO CAREFUL OBSERVATION AT FIRST HE WAS ONLY AWARE THAT THE DOG WAS REPEATING HIS SHORT DANGEROUS BARK FROM TIME TO TIME SNAPPING VICIOUSLY AT THE EMPTY AIR A FOOT OR SO FROM THE GROUND ONCE INDEED
8108-274318-0009 HE SPRANG UPWARDS AND FORWARDS WORKING FURIOUSLY WITH TEETH AND PAWS AND WITH A NOISE LIKE WOLVES FIGHTING BUT ONLY TO DASH BACK THE NEXT MINUTE AGAINST THE WALL BEHIND HIM THEN AFTER LYING STILL FOR A BIT HE ROSE TO A CROUCHING POSITION
8108-274318-0010 AS THOUGH TO SPRING AGAIN SNARLING HORRIBLY AND MAKING SHORT HALF CIRCLES WITH LOWERED HEAD AND SMOKE ALL THE WHILE MEOWED PITEOUSLY BY THE WINDOW AS THOUGH TRYING TO DRAW THE ATTACK UPON HIMSELF THEN IT WAS THAT THE RUSH OF THE WHOLE DREADFUL BUSINESS
8108-274318-0011 SEEMED TO TURN ASIDE FROM THE DOG AND DIRECT ITSELF UPON HIS OWN PERSON THE COLLIE HAD MADE ANOTHER SPRING AND FALLEN BACK WITH A CRASH INTO THE CORNER WHERE HE MADE NOISE ENOUGH IN HIS SAVAGE RAGE TO WAKEN THE DEAD BEFORE HE FELL TO WHINING
8108-274318-0012 AND DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS THE DOCTOR'S OWN DISTRESS BECAME INTOLERABLY ACUTE HE HAD MADE A HALF MOVEMENT FORWARD TO COME TO THE RESCUE WHEN A VEIL THAT WAS DENSER THAN MERE FOG SEEMED TO DROP DOWN OVER THE SCENE DRAPING ROOM
8108-274318-0013 WALLS ANIMALS AND FIRE IN A MIST OF DARKNESS AND FOLDING ALSO ABOUT HIS OWN MIND OTHER FORMS MOVED SILENTLY ACROSS THE FIELD OF VISION FORMS THAT HE RECOGNISED FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS AND WELCOMED NOT
8108-274318-0014 UNHOLY THOUGHTS BEGAN TO CROWD INTO HIS BRAIN SINISTER SUGGESTIONS OF EVIL PRESENTED THEMSELVES SEDUCTIVELY ICE SEEMED TO SETTLE ABOUT HIS HEART AND HIS MIND TREMBLED HE BEGAN TO LOSE MEMORY
8108-274318-0015 MEMORY OF HIS IDENTITY OF WHERE HE WAS OF WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF HIS STRENGTH WERE SHAKEN
8108-274318-0016 AND IT WAS THEN THAT THE ROOM FILLED WITH THIS HORDE OF CATS ALL DARK AS THE NIGHT ALL SILENT ALL WITH LAMPING EYES OF GREEN FIRE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE PLACE ALTERED AND SHIFTED HE WAS IN A MUCH LARGER SPACE
8108-274318-0017 THE WHINING OF THE DOG SOUNDED FAR AWAY AND ALL ABOUT HIM THE CATS FLEW BUSILY TO AND FRO SILENTLY PLAYING THEIR TEARING RUSHING GAME OF EVIL WEAVING THE PATTERN OF THEIR DARK PURPOSE UPON THE FLOOR
8108-274318-0018 HE STROVE HARD TO COLLECT HIMSELF AND REMEMBER THE WORDS OF POWER HE HAD MADE USE OF BEFORE IN SIMILAR DREAD POSITIONS WHERE HIS DANGEROUS PRACTICE HAD SOMETIMES LED BUT HE COULD RECALL NOTHING CONSECUTIVELY
8108-274318-0019 A MIST LAY OVER HIS MIND AND MEMORY HE FELT DAZED AND HIS FORCES SCATTERED THE DEEPS WITHIN WERE TOO TROUBLED FOR HEALING POWER TO COME OUT OF THEM IT WAS GLAMOUR OF COURSE HE REALISED AFTERWARDS
8108-274318-0020 THE STRONG GLAMOUR THROWN UPON HIS IMAGINATION BY SOME POWERFUL PERSONALITY BEHIND THE VEIL BUT AT THE TIME HE WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY AWARE OF THIS AND AS WITH ALL TRUE GLAMOUR WAS UNABLE TO GRASP
8108-274318-0021 BEHIND HIM LIKE WIND BOOMING AND TEARING ITS WAY DOWN THE WINDOWS RATTLED THE CANDLE FLICKERED AND WENT OUT THE GLACIAL ATMOSPHERE CLOSED ROUND HIM WITH THE COLD OF DEATH AND A GREAT RUSHING SOUND SWEPT BY OVERHEAD
8108-274318-0022 SOMETHING FROM THE REGION OF UTTER COLD WAS UPON HIM AND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY THROUGH THE CONFUSED MISTS ABOUT HIM THERE SLOWLY ROSE UP THE PERSONALITY THAT HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME DIRECTING THE BATTLE SOME FORCE ENTERED HIS BEING
8108-274318-0023 THAT SHOOK HIM AS THE TEMPEST SHAKES A LEAF AND CLOSE AGAINST HIS EYES CLEAN LEVEL WITH HIS FACE HE FOUND HIMSELF STARING INTO THE WRECK OF A VAST DARK COUNTENANCE A COUNTENANCE THAT WAS TERRIBLE EVEN IN ITS RUIN
8108-274318-0024 AND THE MARK OF SPIRITUAL EVIL WAS BRANDED EVERYWHERE UPON ITS BROKEN FEATURES EYES FACE AND HAIR ROSE LEVEL WITH HIS OWN
8108-274318-0025 HE NEVER COULD PROPERLY MEASURE OR DETERMINE THESE TWO A MAN AND A WOMAN LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO EACH OTHER'S VISAGES AND DOWN INTO EACH OTHER'S HEARTS AND JOHN SILENCE THE SOUL WITH THE GOOD UNSELFISH MOTIVE
8108-274318-0026 HELD HIS OWN AGAINST THE DARK DISCARNATE WOMAN WHOSE MOTIVE WAS PURE EVIL AND WHOSE SOUL WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE DARK POWERS IT WAS THE CLIMAX THAT TOUCHED THE DEPTH OF POWER WITHIN HIM AND BEGAN TO RESTORE HIM SLOWLY TO HIS OWN
8108-274318-0027 HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF COURSE OF EFFORT AND YET IT SEEMED NO SUPERHUMAN ONE FOR HE HAD RECOGNISED THE CHARACTER OF HIS OPPONENT'S POWER AND HE CALLED UPON THE GOOD WITHIN HIM TO MEET AND OVERCOME IT
8108-274318-0028 THE INNER FORCES STIRRED AND TREMBLED IN RESPONSE TO HIS CALL THEY DID NOT AT FIRST COME READILY AS WAS THEIR HABIT FOR UNDER THE SPELL OF GLAMOUR THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN DIABOLICALLY LULLED INTO INACTIVITY BUT COME THEY EVENTUALLY DID
8108-274318-0029 AND POWER AND CONFIDENCE CAME WITH THEM HE BEGAN TO BREATHE DEEPLY AND REGULARLY AND AT THE SAME TIME TO ABSORB INTO HIMSELF THE FORCES OPPOSED TO HIM AND TO TURN THEM TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT
8108-274318-0030 BY CEASING TO RESIST AND ALLOWING THE DEADLY STREAM TO POUR INTO HIM UNOPPOSED HE USED THE VERY POWER SUPPLIED BY HIS ADVERSARY AND THUS ENORMOUSLY INCREASED HIS OWN FOR THIS SPIRITUAL ALCHEMY HE HAD LEARNED HE UNDERSTOOD THAT FORCE
8108-274318-0031 ULTIMATELY IS EVERYWHERE ONE AND THE SAME IT IS THE MOTIVE BEHIND THAT MAKES IT GOOD OR EVIL AND HIS MOTIVE WAS ENTIRELY UNSELFISH HE KNEW PROVIDED HE WAS NOT FIRST ROBBED OF SELF CONTROL
8108-274318-0032 HOW VICARIOUSLY TO ABSORB THESE EVIL RADIATIONS INTO HIMSELF AND CHANGE THEM MAGICALLY INTO HIS OWN GOOD PURPOSES AND SINCE HIS MOTIVE WAS PURE AND HIS SOUL FEARLESS THEY COULD NOT WORK HIM HARM
8108-274318-0033 THUS HE STOOD IN THE MAIN STREAM OF EVIL UNWITTINGLY ATTRACTED BY PENDER DEFLECTING ITS COURSE UPON HIMSELF AND AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE PURIFYING FILTER OF HIS OWN UNSELFISHNESS THESE ENERGIES COULD ONLY ADD TO HIS STORE OF EXPERIENCE OF KNOWLEDGE
8108-274318-0034 AND THEREFORE OF POWER AND AS HIS SELF CONTROL RETURNED TO HIM HE GRADUALLY ACCOMPLISHED THIS PURPOSE EVEN THOUGH TREMBLING WHILE HE DID SO YET THE STRUGGLE WAS SEVERE AND IN SPITE OF THE FREEZING CHILL OF THE AIR
8108-274318-0035 THE PERSPIRATION POURED DOWN HIS FACE THEN BY SLOW DEGREES THE DARK AND DREADFUL COUNTENANCE FADED THE GLAMOUR PASSED FROM HIS SOUL THE NORMAL PROPORTIONS RETURNED TO WALLS AND CEILING THE FORMS MELTED BACK INTO THE FOG
8108-274318-0036 AND THE WHIRL OF RUSHING SHADOW CATS DISAPPEARED WHENCE THEY CAME AND WITH THE RETURN OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS OWN IDENTITY JOHN SILENCE WAS RESTORED TO THE FULL CONTROL OF HIS OWN WILL POWER IN A DEEP MODULATED VOICE
8108-274318-0037 HE MADE CERTAIN SIGILS GESTURES AND MOVEMENTS AT THE SAME TIME FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE CONTINUED TO UTTER THESE WORDS UNTIL AT LENGTH THE GROWING VOLUME DOMINATED THE WHOLE ROOM AND MASTERED THE MANIFESTATION OF ALL THAT OPPOSED IT
8108-274318-0038 FOR JUST AS HE UNDERSTOOD THE SPIRITUAL ALCHEMY THAT CAN TRANSMUTE EVIL FORCES BY RAISING THEM INTO HIGHER CHANNELS SO HE KNEW FROM LONG STUDY THE OCCULT USE OF SOUND AND ITS DIRECT EFFECT UPON THE PLASTIC REGION
8108-274318-0039 WHEREIN THE POWERS OF SPIRITUAL EVIL WORK THEIR FELL PURPOSES HARMONY WAS RESTORED FIRST OF ALL TO HIS OWN SOUL AND THENCE TO THE ROOM AND ALL ITS OCCUPANTS AND AFTER HIMSELF THE FIRST TO RECOGNISE IT WAS THE OLD DOG LYING IN HIS CORNER
8108-274318-0040 FLAME BEGAN SUDDENLY UTTERING SOUNDS OF PLEASURE THAT SOMETHING BETWEEN A GROWL AND A GRUNT THAT DOGS MAKE UPON BEING RESTORED TO THEIR MASTER'S CONFIDENCE DOCTOR SILENCE HEARD THE THUMPING OF THE COLLIE'S TAIL AGAINST THE FLOOR AND THE GRUNT
8108-274318-0041 AND THE THUMPING TOUCHED THE DEPTH OF AFFECTION IN THE MAN'S HEART AND GAVE HIM SOME INKLING OF WHAT AGONIES THE DUMB CREATURE HAD SUFFERED NEXT FROM THE SHADOWS BY THE WINDOW A SOMEWHAT SHRILL PURRING ANNOUNCED THE RESTORATION OF THE CAT TO ITS NORMAL STATE
8108-274318-0042 SMOKE WAS ADVANCING ACROSS THE CARPET HE SEEMED VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF AND SMILED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SUPREME INNOCENCE HE WAS NO SHADOW CAT BUT REAL AND FULL OF HIS USUAL AND PERFECT SELF POSSESSION HE MARCHED ALONG PICKING HIS WAY DELICATELY
8108-274318-0043 CLEARLY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE MISCHIEF TO WHICH HE HAD UNWITTINGLY LENT HIMSELF OWING TO HIS SUBTLE AND ELECTRIC CONSTITUTION STILL UTTERING HIS SHARP HIGH PURRINGS HE MARCHED UP TO HIS MASTER AND RUBBED VIGOROUSLY AGAINST HIS LEGS
8108-274318-0044 AND PAWED HIS KNEES AND STARED BESEECHINGLY UP INTO HIS FACE HE TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE CORNER WHERE THE COLLIE STILL LAY THUMPING HIS TAIL FEEBLY AND PATHETICALLY JOHN SILENCE UNDERSTOOD HE BENT DOWN AND STROKED THE CREATURE'S LIVING FUR
8108-274318-0045 NOTING THE LINE OF BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS THAT FOLLOWED THE MOTION OF HIS HAND DOWN ITS BACK AND THEN THEY ADVANCED TOGETHER TOWARDS THE CORNER WHERE THE DOG WAS SMOKE WENT FIRST AND PUT HIS NOSE GENTLY AGAINST HIS FRIEND'S MUZZLE PURRING WHILE HE RUBBED
8108-274318-0046 AND UTTERING LITTLE SOFT SOUNDS OF AFFECTION IN HIS THROAT THE DOCTOR LIT THE CANDLE AND BROUGHT IT OVER HE SAW THE COLLIE LYING ON ITS SIDE AGAINST THE WALL IT WAS UTTERLY EXHAUSTED AND FOAM STILL HUNG ABOUT ITS JAWS ITS TAIL AND EYES RESPONDED TO THE SOUND OF ITS NAME
8108-274318-0047 BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY VERY WEAK AND OVERCOME SMOKE CONTINUED TO RUB AGAINST ITS CHEEK AND NOSE AND EYES SOMETIMES EVEN STANDING ON ITS BODY AND KNEADING INTO THE THICK YELLOW HAIR FLAME REPLIED FROM TIME TO TIME BY LITTLE LICKS OF THE TONGUE
8108-274318-0048 MOST OF THEM CURIOUSLY MISDIRECTED BUT DOCTOR SILENCE FELT INTUITIVELY THAT SOMETHING DISASTROUS HAD HAPPENED AND HIS HEART WAS WRUNG HE STROKED THE DEAR BODY FEELING IT OVER FOR BRUISES OR BROKEN BONES BUT FINDING NONE
8108-280354-0000 JASON HAD PERSUADED ORPHEUS TO ACCOMPANY THE ARGONAUTS WHEN THEY WENT TO FETCH BACK THE GOLDEN FLEECE FOR HE KNEW THAT THE PERILS OF THE WAY WOULD BE LIGHTENED BY SONG TO THE SOUND OF HIS LYRE THE ARGO HAD FLOATED DOWN TO THE SEA
8108-280354-0001 AND HE PLAYED SO SWEETLY WHEN THEY PASSED THE ROCKS OF THE SIRENS THAT THE DREADFUL MONSTERS SANG THEIR MOST ALLURING STRAINS IN VAIN
8108-280354-0002 WHOM HE LOVED DEARLY AND WHO RETURNED HIS LOVE BUT AT THEIR MARRIAGE THE OMENS WERE NOT FAVORABLE HYMEN THE MARRIAGE GOD CAME TO IT WITH A GLOOMY COUNTENANCE AND THE WEDDING TORCHES SMOKED
8108-280354-0003 AND WOULD NOT GIVE FORTH A CHEERFUL FLAME
8108-280354-0004 WAS TO BE BUT SHORT LIVED FOR AS THE NEW MADE BRIDE WANDERED THROUGH THE WOODS WITH THE OTHER NYMPHS A POISONOUS SERPENT STUNG HER HEEL AND NO REMEDY AVAILED TO SAVE HER ORPHEUS WAS THROWN
8108-280354-0005 INTO MOST PASSIONATE GRIEF AT HIS WIFE'S DEATH HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAD LOST HER FOR EVER BUT PRAYED DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT CEASING TO THE GODS ABOVE TO RESTORE HER TO HIM WHEN THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN
8108-280354-0006 HE RESOLVED TO MAKE ONE LAST EFFORT TO WIN HER BACK HE WOULD GO DOWN TO THE LOWER WORLD AND SEEK HER AMONG THE DEAD AND TRY WHETHER ANY PRAYER OR PERSUASION COULD MOVE PLUTO TO RESTORE HIS BELOVED NEAR TAENARUM
8108-280354-0007 IN LACONIA WAS A CAVE AMONG DARK AND GLOOMY ROCKS THROUGH WHICH LED ONE OF THE ENTRANCES TO THE LOWER WORLD THIS WAS THE ROAD BY WHICH HERCULES DESCENDED WHEN HE WENT TO CARRY OFF CERBERUS
8108-280354-0008 THE THREE HEADED DOG THAT GUARDS THE THRESHOLD OF PLUTO UNDAUNTED BY THE TERRORS OF THE PLACE ORPHEUS PASSED THROUGH THIS GATE AND DOWN A DARK AND DISMAL ROAD TO THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD
8108-280354-0009 HERE HE CAME IN SAFETY THROUGH THE CROWD OF GHOSTS AND PHANTOMS AND STOOD AT LAST BEFORE THE THRONE OF PLUTO AND PROSERPINA THEN HE TOUCHED THE CHORDS OF HIS LYRE AND CHANTED THESE WORDS
8108-280354-0010 GREAT LORDS OF THE WORLD BELOW THE EARTH TO WHICH ALL WE MORTALS MUST ONE DAY COME GRANT ME TO TELL A SIMPLE TALE
8108-280354-0011 THE LIFELESS GHOSTS CAME FLOCKING AND AS THEY HEARD THEY WEPT TANTALUS FORGOT HIS HUNGER AND THIRST
8108-280354-0012 SAT ON HIS STONE TO LISTEN NEVER YET HAD SUCH SWEET STRAINS BEEN HEARD IN THE WORLD OF GLOOM THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME TEARS MOISTENED THE CHEEKS OF THE FURIES AND EVEN THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE DEAD WERE MOVED TO PITY
8108-280354-0013 AND SHE CAME YET HALTING FROM HER RECENT WOUND TAKE HER SAYS PLUTO AND LEAD HER BACK TO THE LIGHT
8108-280354-0014 NOR MUST YOU ONCE TURN ROUND TO LOOK UPON HER
8108-280354-0015 ELSE THE BOON WE GRANT YOU WILL BE BUT VAIN A STEEP PATH LED UPWARD FROM THE REALM OF DARKNESS AND THE WAY WAS HARD TO FIND THROUGH THE GLOOM IN SILENCE ORPHEUS LED ON TILL THE GOAL WAS CLOSE AT HAND
8108-280354-0016 AND THE WELCOMING LIGHT OF THE UPPER AIR BEGAN TO PENETRATE THE DARKNESS THEN A SUDDEN FEAR STRUCK HIS HEART
8108-280354-0017 HE TURNED TO GAZE ON HIS BELOVED DIMLY HE SAW HER BUT FOR THE LAST TIME FOR A POWER SHE COULD NOT RESIST DREW HER BACK ORPHEUS STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS AND TRIED TO SEIZE HER BUT HE ONLY CLASPED THE EMPTY AIR
8108-280354-0018 HE SAT ON THE FURTHER BANK WITHOUT FOOD OR DRINK
8108-280354-0019 THEN AT LAST HE KNEW THAT THE GODS BELOW WERE PITILESS AND FULL OF SORROW HE RETURNED TO THE UPPER EARTH FOR THREE YEARS
8108-280354-0020 FINDING HIS ONLY CONSOLATION IN THE MUSIC OF HIS LYRE FOR HE SHUNNED ALL MEN AND WOMEN
8108-280354-0021 ONE DAY HE SAT DOWN TO REST ON A GRASSY HILL IN THE SUNSHINE AND PLAYED AND SANG TO BEGUILE HIS SORROW AS HE PLAYED THE COOLNESS OF SHADY BRANCHES SEEMED ALL ABOUT HIM AND LOOKING UP HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MIDST OF A WOOD
8108-280354-0022 OAK POPLAR LIME BEECH LAUREL ASH PINE PLANE AND MAPLE AND MANY ANOTHER TREE HAD GATHERED TOGETHER HERE DRAWN FROM THEIR DISTANT FOREST HOMES BY THE SOUNDS OF ORPHEUS'S LYRE
8108-280354-0023 YES AND THE BEASTS AND THE BIRDS OF THE FIELD CAME TOO AND ORPHEUS SAT IN THEIR MIDST AND SANG AND PLAYED THE TUNES OF SORROW SUDDENLY A GREAT NOISE WAS HEARD OF LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING AND MERRY MAKING
8108-280354-0024 FOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEASTS OF BACCHUS AND THE WOMEN WERE CELEBRATING HIS RITES WANDERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH DANCE AND REVEL WHEN THEY SAW ORPHEUS THEY SET UP A SHOUT OF DERISION SEE THEY CRIED
8108-280354-0025 THE WRETCHED SINGER WHO MOCKS AT WOMEN AND WILL HAVE NO BRIDE BUT THE DEAD COME LET US KILL HIM AND SHOW THAT NO MAN SHALL DESPISE US UNPUNISHED WITH THESE WORDS THEY BEGAN TO THROW WANDS AND STONES AT HIM
8108-280354-0026 AND FELL HARMLESSLY TO THE GROUND THEN THE WOMEN RAISED A WILD SHOUT AND MADE SUCH A CLAMOR WITH TRUMPETS AND CYMBALS THAT THE SOFT TONES OF THE HARP WERE DROWNED BY THE NOISE NOW AT LAST THE SHOTS TOOK EFFECT
8108-280354-0027 AND IN THEIR FURY THE WOMEN FELL UPON HIM DEALING BLOW ON BLOW ORPHEUS FELL LIFELESS TO THE GROUND BUT HE WAS NOT TO DIE UNWEPT THE LITTLE BIRDS OF THE FOREST MOURNED FOR HIM EVEN THE STONY ROCKS WEPT
8108-280354-0028 THE TREES SHED THEIR LEAVES WITH GRIEF AND THE DRYADS AND NAIADS TORE THEIR HAIR AND PUT ON THE GARB OF SORROW ONLY THE PITILESS REVELERS KNEW NO REMORSE THEY SEIZED THE SINGER'S HEAD
8108-280354-0029 AND THREW IT WITH HIS LYRE INTO THE RIVER HEBRUS THERE IT FLOATED DOWN STREAM AND STRANGE TO TELL THE CHORDS GAVE FORTH A LAMENT AND THE LIFELESS TONGUE UTTERED WORDS
8108-280354-0030 IT CRIED TILL HEAD AND LYRE WERE CARRIED DOWN TO THE SEA AND ON TO LESBOS THE ISLE OF SWEET SONG WHERE IN AFTER YEARS
8108-280354-0031 AND SAPPHO TUNED AFRESH THE LYRE OF ORPHEUS
8108-280359-0000 FOR THE FUTURE HE MUST BEND ALL HIS CUNNING AND VIGILANCE TO THE TASK OF HIDING HIMSELF FROM THE GAZE OF THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO INJURED AND ESCAPING THE JUST PUNISHMENT HE HAD BROUGHT UPON HIMSELF
8108-280359-0001 THE WORLD IS LARGE AND I AM VERY CLEVER SAID LOKI TO HIMSELF AS HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON ASGARD AND WANDERED OUT INTO MANHEIM
8108-280359-0002 AND NO MEASURE FOR THE DEEP WATERS NEITHER IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY OF COUNTING THE VARIOUS FORMS UNDER WHICH I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF ODIN WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND ME
8108-280359-0003 I HAVE NO CAUSE TO FEAR BUT THOUGH LOKI REPEATED THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO HIMSELF HE WAS AFRAID HE WANDERED FAR INTO THE THICK WOODS AND COVERED HIMSELF WITH THE DEEP WATERS
8108-280359-0004 HE CLIMBED TO THE TOPS OF MISTY HILLS AND CROUCHED IN THE DARK OF HOLLOW CAVES BUT ABOVE THE WOOD AND THROUGH THE WATER AND DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS A SINGLE RAY OF CALM CLEAR LIGHT SEEMED ALWAYS TO FOLLOW HIM
8108-280359-0005 AND HE KNEW THAT IT CAME FROM THE EYE OF ODIN WHO WAS WATCHING HIM FROM AIR THRONE THEN HE TRIED TO ESCAPE THE WATCHFUL EYE BY DISGUISING HIMSELF UNDER VARIOUS SHAPES SOMETIMES HE WAS AN EAGLE ON A LONELY MOUNTAIN CRAG
8108-280359-0006 SOMETIMES HE HID HIMSELF AS ONE AMONG A TROOP OF TIMID REINDEER SOMETIMES HE LAY IN THE NEST OF A WOOD PIGEON SOMETIMES HE SWAM A BRIGHT SPOTTED FISH IN THE SEA BUT WHEREVER HE WAS AMONG LIVING CREATURES
8108-280359-0007 OR ALONE WITH DEAD NATURE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO KNOW HIM AND TO FIND A VOICE IN WHICH TO SAY TO HIM
8108-280359-0008 AIR EARTH OR WATER THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIM ANYWHERE TIRED AT LAST OF SEEKING WHAT HE COULD NOWHERE FIND LOKI BUILT HIMSELF A HOUSE NEAR A NARROW GLITTERING RIVER WHICH LOWER DOWN FLASHED FROM A HIGH ROCK INTO THE SEA BELOW
8108-280359-0009 HE TOOK CARE THAT HIS HOUSE SHOULD HAVE FOUR DOORS IN IT THAT HE MIGHT LOOK OUT ON EVERY SIDE AND CATCH THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE GODS WHEN THEY CAME AS HE KNEW THEY WOULD COME TO TAKE HIM AWAY HERE HIS WIFE SIGUNA AND HIS TWO SONS
8108-280359-0010 ALI AND NARI CAME TO LIVE WITH HIM SIGUNA WAS A KIND WOMAN FAR TOO GOOD AND KIND FOR LOKI SHE FELT SORRY FOR HIM NOW THAT SHE SAW HE WAS IN GREAT FEAR AND THAT EVERY LIVING THING HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM
8108-280359-0011 AND SHE WOULD HAVE HIDDEN HIM FROM THE JUST ANGER OF THE GODS IF SHE COULD BUT THE TWO SONS CARED LITTLE ABOUT THEIR FATHER'S DREAD AND DANGER THEY SPENT ALL THEIR TIME IN QUARRELING WITH EACH OTHER AND THEIR LOUD ANGRY VOICES SOUNDING ABOVE THE WATERFALL
8108-280359-0012 WOULD SPEEDILY HAVE BETRAYED THE HIDING PLACE EVEN IF ODIN'S PIERCING EYE HAD NOT ALREADY FOUND IT OUT AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS HOUSE LOOKING ALTERNATELY OUT OF ALL THE FOUR DOORS AND AMUSING HIMSELF AS WELL AS HE COULD
8108-280359-0013 BY MAKING A FISHING NET HE SPIED IN THE DISTANCE THE WHOLE COMPANY OF THE GODS APPROACHING HIS HOUSE THE SIGHT OF THEM COMING ALL TOGETHER BEAUTIFUL AND NOBLE AND FREE PIERCED LOKI WITH A PANG THAT WAS WORSE THAN DEATH
8108-280359-0014 HE ROSE WITHOUT DARING TO LOOK AGAIN THREW HIS NET ON A FIRE THAT BURNED ON THE FLOOR AND RUSHING TO THE SIDE OF THE LITTLE RIVER HE TURNED HIMSELF INTO A SALMON SWAM DOWN TO THE DEEPEST STILLEST POOL AT THE BOTTOM
8108-280359-0015 AND HID HIMSELF BETWEEN TWO STONES THE GODS ENTERED THE HOUSE AND LOOKED ALL ROUND IN VAIN FOR LOKI
8108-280359-0016 FAMOUS FOR HIS KEEN SIGHT SPIED OUT THE REMAINS OF THE FISHING NET IN THE FIRE THEN ODIN KNEW AT ONCE THAT THERE WAS A RIVER NEAR AND THAT IT WAS THERE WHERE LOKI HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF HE ORDERED HIS SONS TO MAKE A NEW NET AND TO CAST IT INTO THE WATER
8108-280359-0017 AND DRAG OUT WHATEVER LIVING THING THEY COULD FIND THERE IT WAS DONE AS HE DESIRED THOR HELD ONE END OF THE NET AND ALL THE REST OF THE GODS DREW THE OTHER THROUGH THE WATER WHEN THEY PULLED IT UP THE FIRST TIME HOWEVER IT WAS EMPTY AND THEY WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY DISAPPOINTED
8108-280359-0018 SAW THAT SOMETHING LIVING HAD CERTAINLY TOUCHED THEM THEY THEN ADDED A WEIGHT TO THE NET AND THREW IT WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER AND DRAGGED UP THE STONES IN THE POOL LOKI NOW SAW THE DANGER HE WAS IN OF BEING CAUGHT IN THE NET AND
8108-280359-0019 BUT NOT SO QUICKLY BUT THAT THE GODS SAW HIM KNEW HIM THROUGH HIS DISGUISE AND RESOLVED THAT HE SHOULD NO LONGER ESCAPE THEY THEMSELVES DIVIDED INTO TWO BANDS THOR WADED DOWN THE RIVER TO THE WATERFALL
8108-280359-0020 THE OTHER GODS STOOD IN A GROUP BELOW LOKI SWAM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN THEM FIRST HE THOUGHT HE WOULD DART OUT INTO THE SEA AND THEN THAT HE WOULD SPRING OVER THE NET BACK AGAIN INTO THE RIVER THIS LAST SEEMED THE EASIEST WAY OF ESCAPE
8108-280359-0021 AND WITH THE GREATEST SPEED HE ATTEMPTED IT THOR HOWEVER WAS WATCHING FOR HIM AND AS SOON AS LOKI LEAPED OUT OF THE WATER HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND CAUGHT HIM WHILE HE WAS YET TURNING IN THE AIR
8108-280359-0022 LOKI WRIGGLED HIS SLIPPERY SLIMY LENGTH THROUGH THOR'S FINGERS BUT THE THUNDERER GRASPED HIM TIGHTLY BY THE TAIL AND HOLDING HIM IN THIS MANNER IN THIS HAND WADED TO THE SHORE THERE FATHER ODIN AND THE OTHER GODS MET HIM AND
8108-280359-0023 AT ODIN'S FIRST SEARCHING LOOK LOKI WAS OBLIGED TO DROP HIS DISGUISE AND COWERING AND FRIGHTENED TO ASSUME HIS PROPER SHAPE BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED LORDS ONE BY ONE THEY TURNED THEIR FACES FROM HIM FOR IN LOOKING AT HIM
8108-280359-0024 THEY SEEMED TO SEE OVER AGAIN THE DEATH OF BALDUR THE BELOVED YOU WERE TOLD THAT THERE WERE HIGH ROCKS LOOKING OVER THE SEA NEAR LOKI'S HOUSE ONE OF THESE HIGHER THAN THE REST HAD MIDWAY FOUR PROJECTING STONES AND TO THESE THE GODS RESOLVED TO BIND LOKI
8108-280359-0025 BE ABLE TO TORMENT THE INHABITANTS OF MANHEIM OR ASGARD BY HIS EVIL DOINGS THOR PROPOSED TO RETURN TO ASGARD TO BRING A CHAIN WITH WHICH TO BIND THE PRISONER BUT ODIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE HAD NO NEED TO TAKE SUCH A JOURNEY
8108-280359-0026 LOKI HE SAID HAS ALREADY FORGED FOR HIMSELF A CHAIN STRONGER THAN ANY YOU CAN MAKE WHILE WE HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN CATCHING HIM HIS TWO SONS ALI AND NARI TRANSFORMED INTO WOLVES
8108-280359-0027 BY THEIR EVIL PASSIONS HAVE FOUGHT WITH AND DESTROYED EACH OTHER WITH THEIR SINEWS WE MUST MAKE A CHAIN TO BIND THEIR FATHER AND FROM THAT HE CAN NEVER ESCAPE IT WAS DONE AS ASA ODIN SAID
8108-280359-0028 A ROPE WAS MADE OF THE DEAD WOLVES SINEWS AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHED LOKI'S BODY IT TURNED INTO BANDS OF IRON
8609-262281-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN MUCH TO ALTER AT THE SAME MOMENT CONSTANCE CHANNING WAS TRAVERSING THE BOUNDARIES ON HER WAY TO LADY AUGUSTA YORKE'S WHERE SHE HAD SOME DAYS SINCE COMMENCED HER DUTIES IT TOOK HER SCARCELY TWO MINUTES TO GET THERE FOR THE HOUSES WERE ALMOST WITHIN VIEW OF EACH OTHER

8609-262281-0024 IT WILL BE ONLY RIGHT TO DO SO SUPPOSE WE ARE BOTH GOOD AND MERIT IT EQUALLY SUGGESTED FANNY
8609-262281-0025 YOU MUST NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IF IN THAT CASE I GIVE THE PRIVILEGE TO CAROLINE AS BEING THE ELDER OF THE TWO BUT I WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU IN SOME OTHER WAY ALAS FOR POOR CAROLINE'S RESOLUTION FOR A SHORT TIME AN HOUR OR SO SHE DID STRIVE TO DO HER BEST
8609-262281-0026 BUT THEN GOOD RESOLUTIONS WERE FORGOTTEN AND IDLENESS FOLLOWED NOT ONLY IDLENESS TEMPER ALSO
8609-262281-0027 SHE EVEN FORGOT HERSELF SO FAR AS TO BE INSOLENT FANNY WAS TAKEN TO THE MEETING YOU SAW HER IN THE CARRIAGE WHEN LADY AUGUSTA DROVE TO MISTER GALLOWAY'S OFFICE AND PERSUADED HAMISH TO JOIN THEM CAROLINE WAS LEFT AT HOME IN A STATE OF OPEN REBELLION WITH THE LESSONS TO LEARN
8609-262281-0028 WHICH SHE HAD NOT LEARNT IN THE DAY HOW SHALL YOU GET ON WITH THEM CONSTANCE THE REV WILLIAM YORKE INQUIRED OF HER THAT SAME EVENING HAVE THE WEEDS DESTROYED THE GOOD SEED NOT QUITE DESTROYED IT REPLIED CONSTANCE THOUGH SHE SIGHED SADLY AS SHE SPOKE
8609-262281-0029 THERE IS SO MUCH ILL TO UNDO CAROLINE IS THE WORST THE WEEDS WITH HER HAVE HAD LONGER TIME TO GET AHEAD I THINK PERHAPS IF I COULD KEEP HER WHOLLY WITH ME FOR A TWELVEMONTH OR SO WATCHING OVER HER CONSTANTLY A GREAT DEAL MIGHT BE EFFECTED
8609-262281-0030 IF THAT ANTICIPATED LIVING WOULD FALL IN WHICH SEEMS VERY FAR AWAY IN THE CLOUDS AND YOU WERE WHOLLY MINE WE MIGHT HAVE CAROLINE WITH US FOR A TIME LAUGHED MISTER YORKE CONSTANCE LAUGHED TOO DO NOT BE IMPATIENT
8609-262281-0031 OR IT WILL SEEM TO BE FURTHER OFF STILL IT WILL COME WILLIAM THEY HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN AN UNDERTONE STANDING TOGETHER AT A WINDOW APART FROM THE REST MISTER CHANNING WAS LYING ON HIS SOFA UNDERNEATH THE OTHER WINDOW AND NOW SPOKE TO MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0032 REPLIED MISTER CHANNING I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HIS EXPERIENCE IN ANOTHER LINE MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU CONTINUED MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0033 I HAVE HEARD SO HIS COMPLAINT WAS RHEUMATISM VERY MUCH AS I FANCY THE SAME SORT OF RHEUMATISM THAT AFFLICTS YOU HE TOLD ME HE CAME TO EUROPE WITH VERY LITTLE HOPE HE FEARED HIS COMPLAINT HAD BECOME CHRONIC AND INCURABLE
8609-262281-0034 BUT HE HAS BEEN RESTORED IN A WONDERFUL MANNER AND IS IN SOUND HEALTH AGAIN AND WHAT REMEDIES DID HE USE EAGERLY ASKED MISTER CHANNING A THREE MONTHS RESIDENCE AT SOME MEDICINAL SPRINGS IN GERMANY NOTHING ELSE WHEN I SAY NOTHING ELSE OF COURSE I MUST IMPLY THAT HE WAS UNDER MEDICAL TREATMENT THERE
8609-262281-0035 IT IS THE VERY THING YOU SEE SIR THAT HAS BEEN ORDERED FOR YOU AY SIGHED MISTER CHANNING FEELING HOW VERY FAINT APPEARED TO BE THE HOPE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING IT I WAS MENTIONING YOUR CASE TO HIM OBSERVED MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0036 THE CHANNINGS THEMSELVES WERE SILENT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE WAY AT ALL CLEAR WHEN MISTER YORKE WAS LEAVING HE BECKONED CONSTANCE AND ARTHUR INTO THE HALL
8609-262281-0037 THINK OF ALL THAT IS AT STAKE RENEWED HEALTH EXERTION HAPPINESS ARTHUR
8609-262281-0038 ARTHUR DID NOT FEEL HOPEFUL INDEED HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM THE WHOLE TIME THAT THEY WERE TALKING HAMISH AND HIS DIFFICULTIES WERE THE DARK SHADOW THOUGH HE COULD NOT TELL THIS TO MISTER YORKE WERE MISTER CHANNING TO GO ABROAD AND THE ARREST OF HAMISH TO FOLLOW UPON IT
8609-262281-0039 DOCTOR LAMB SAYS THE COST WAS SO TRIFLING AS SCARCELY TO BE CREDITED CONTINUED MISTER YORKE IN A TONE OF REMONSTRANCE ARTHUR DON'T YOU CARE TO HELP TO SAVE HIM I WOULD MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO SAVE MY FATHER IMPULSIVELY SPOKE ARTHUR
8609-262281-0040 STUNG BY THE IMPLIED REPROOF I SHOULD NOT CARE WHAT LABOUR IT COST ME TO PROCURE THE MONEY SO THAT I SUCCEEDED WE ALL WOULD SAID CONSTANCE YOU MUST KNOW WE WOULD WILLIAM FROM HAMISH DOWNWARDS
8609-262281-0041 DID YOU THINK I WAS LOST I WAS SEDUCED INTO JOINING YOUR MISSIONARY MEETING PEOPLE AND HAVE HAD TO STOP LATE AT THE OFFICE TO MAKE UP FOR IT
8609-262281-0042 FRESH HOPE SEEMS TO ARISE DAILY THAT THOSE GERMAN BATHS WOULD RESTORE HIM TO HEALTH THEY CURED DOCTOR LAMB I SAY HAMISH THAT THE MONEY MUST BE FOUND FOR IT SOMEHOW ADDED MISTER YORKE FOUND OF COURSE IT SHALL BE FOUND CRIED GAY HAMISH
8609-262281-0043 I INTEND TO BE A CHIEF CONTRIBUTOR TO IT MYSELF BUT HIS JOKING WORDS AND CARELESS MANNER JARRED AT THAT MOMENT UPON THE SPIRIT BOTH OF ARTHUR AND CONSTANCE CHANNING WHY
8609-283227-0000 HE AND ANOTHER FARMER HIS NEIGHBOUR HAD BEEN SO OFTEN RE ELECTED CHURCHWARDENS THAT AT LAST THEY SEEMED TO HAVE GAINED A PRESCRIPTIVE RIGHT TO THE OFFICE AND THE FORM OF ELECTION FELL INTO DISUSE
8609-283227-0001 BEEN SAID ABOUT THE ELECTION OF A COLLEAGUE SO LITTLE SEEMED TO FALL TO THE DUTY OF THE CHURCHWARDEN THAT I REGARDED THE NEGLECT AS A TRIFLE AND WAS REMISS IN SETTING IT RIGHT I HAD THEREFORE TO SUFFER AS WAS JUST INDEED MISTER BROWNRIGG WAS NOT THE MAN TO HAVE POWER IN HIS HANDS UNCHECKED
8609-283227-0002 I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED THAT I WAS ABLE TO RISE ABOUT NOON AND GO INTO MY STUDY THOUGH I WAS VERY WEAK AND HAD NOT YET BEEN OUT WHEN ONE MORNING MISSUS PEARSON CAME INTO THE ROOM AND SAID PLEASE SIR
8609-283227-0003 CONFIDENT THERE MUST BE A GOOD REASON FOR IT AND SO TOLD MISSUS PEARSON TO SHOW HIM IN OH SIR I KNOW YOU WOULD BE VEXED IF YOU HADN'T BEEN TOLD HE EXCLAIMED AND I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR TROUBLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER TOM I SAID
8609-283227-0004 WHICH WERE NECESSARY AND MUST BE DONE BEFORE ANOTHER WINTER I CONFESS I WAS RATHER PLEASED FOR I WANTED MY PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THE CHURCH WAS THEIR PROPERTY AND THAT IT WAS THEIR PRIVILEGE IF THEY COULD REGARD IT AS A BLESSING TO HAVE THE CHURCH TO KEEP IT IN DECENT ORDER AND REPAIR
8609-283227-0005 TO MY CHURCHWARDEN WE MUST CALL A VESTRY BEFORE LONG AND HAVE THIS LOOKED TO NOW MY PREDECESSOR HAD LEFT EVERYTHING OF THE KIND TO HIS CHURCHWARDENS AND THE INHABITANTS FROM THEIR SIDE HAD LIKEWISE LEFT THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO THE CHURCHWARDENS BUT MISTER BROWNRIGG
8609-283227-0006 WHO I MUST SAY HAD TAKEN MORE PAINS THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF ACQUAINTED WITH THE LEGALITIES OF HIS OFFICE DID NOT FAIL TO CALL A VESTRY TO WHICH AS USUAL NO ONE HAD RESPONDED WHEREUPON HE IMPOSED A RATE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN UNAIDED JUDGMENT THIS I BELIEVE
8609-283227-0007 HE DID DURING MY ILLNESS WITH THE NOTION OF PLEASING ME BY THE DISCOVERY THAT THE REPAIRS HAD BEEN ALREADY EFFECTED ACCORDING TO MY MIND NOR DID ANY ONE OF MY CONGREGATION THROW THE LEAST DIFFICULTY IN THE CHURCHWARDEN'S WAY AND NOW I MUST REFER TO ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE HISTORY OF MY PARISH
8609-283227-0008 THERE WAS A LITTLE CHAPEL DOWN A LANE LEADING FROM THE MAIN STREET OF THE VILLAGE IN WHICH THERE WAS SERVICE THREE TIMES EVERY SUNDAY
8609-283227-0009 AMONGST WHOM WERE THE FAMILIES OF TWO OR THREE FARMERS OF SUBSTANCE WHILE THE VILLAGE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTRIBUTED A PORTION OF THE POOREST OF THE INHABITANTS A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE I CAME THEIR MINISTER DIED AND THEY HAD CHOSEN ANOTHER A VERY WORTHY MAN OF CONSIDERABLE ERUDITION
8609-283227-0010 BUT OF EXTREME VIEWS AS I HEARD UPON INSIGNIFICANT POINTS AND MOVED BY A GREAT DISLIKE TO NATIONAL CHURCHES AND EPISCOPACY THIS I SAY IS WHAT I HAD MADE OUT ABOUT HIM FROM WHAT I HAD HEARD
8609-283227-0011 AND MY READER WILL VERY PROBABLY BE INCLINED TO ASK BUT WHY WITH PRINCIPLES SUCH AS YOURS SHOULD YOU HAVE ONLY HEARSAY TO GO UPON WHY DID YOU NOT MAKE THE HONEST MAN'S ACQUAINTANCE IN SUCH A SMALL PLACE MEN SHOULD NOT KEEP EACH OTHER AT ARM'S LENGTH
8609-283227-0012 AND ANY READER WHO SAYS SO WILL SAY RIGHT ALL I HAVE TO SUGGEST FOR MYSELF IS SIMPLY A CERTAIN SHYNESS FOR WHICH I CANNOT ENTIRELY ACCOUNT BUT WHICH WAS PARTLY MADE UP OF FEAR TO INTRUDE OR OF BEING SUPPOSED TO ARROGATE TO MYSELF THE RIGHT OF MAKING ADVANCES
8609-283227-0013 PARTLY OF A DREAD LEST WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON TOGETHER AND SO THE ATTEMPT SHOULD RESULT IN SOMETHING UNPLEASANTLY AWKWARD I DARESAY LIKEWISE THAT THE NATURAL SHELLINESS OF THE ENGLISH HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AT ALL EVENTS I HAD NOT MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
8609-283227-0014 MISTER TEMPLETON THEN HAD REFUSED AS A POINT OF CONSCIENCE TO PAY THE CHURCH RATE WHEN THE COLLECTOR WENT ROUND TO DEMAND IT HAD BEEN SUMMONED BEFORE A MAGISTRATE IN CONSEQUENCE HAD SUFFERED A DEFAULT AND PROCEEDINGS BEING PUSHED FROM THE FIRST IN ALL THE PRIDE OF MISTER BROWNRIGG'S LEGALITY
8609-283227-0015 HAD ON THIS VERY DAY BEEN VISITED BY THE CHURCHWARDEN ACCOMPANIED BY A BROKER FROM THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN OF ADDICEHEAD AND AT THE VERY TIME WHEN I WAS HEARING OF THE FACT WAS SUFFERING DISTRAINT OF HIS GOODS THE PORCINE HEAD OF THE CHURCHWARDEN WAS NOT ON HIS SHOULDERS BY ACCIDENT NOR WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE
8609-283227-0016 BUT I DID NOT WAIT TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS NOW IT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME THAT TOM BORE WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT AT THAT MOMENT PROCEEDINGS WERE THUS DRIVEN TO EXTREMITY I RANG THE BELL FOR MY BOOTS AND TO THE OPEN MOUTHED DISMAY OF MISSUS PEARSON LEFT THE VICARAGE LEANING ON TOM'S ARM
8609-283227-0017 BUT SUCH WAS THE COMMOTION IN MY MIND THAT I HAD BECOME QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF ILLNESS OR EVEN FEEBLENESS HURRYING ON IN MORE TERROR THAN I CAN WELL EXPRESS LEST I SHOULD BE TOO LATE I REACHED MISTER TEMPLETON'S HOUSE JUST AS A SMALL MAHOGANY TABLE WAS BEING HOISTED INTO A SPRING CART
8609-283227-0018 WHICH STOOD AT THE DOOR BREATHLESS WITH HASTE I WAS YET ABLE TO CALL OUT PUT THAT TABLE DOWN DIRECTLY AT THE SAME MOMENT MISTER BROWNRIGG APPEARED FROM WITHIN THE DOOR
8609-283227-0019 I THINK HE HAD NOT HEARD ME YOU SEE I'M PROMPT MISTER WALTON HE SAID BUT BLESS MY SOUL HOW ILL YOU LOOK WITHOUT ANSWERING HIM FOR I WAS MORE ANGRY WITH HIM THAN I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN I REPEATED PUT THAT TABLE DOWN I TELL YOU THEY DID SO
8609-283227-0020 NOW I SAID CARRY IT BACK INTO THE HOUSE WHY SIR INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNRIGG IT'S ALL RIGHT YES I SAID AS RIGHT AS THE DEVIL WOULD HAVE IT
8609-283227-0021 I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT I BELIEVE I HAD THE RIGHT TO BE CHAIRMAN AT THE VESTRY MEETING BUT INSTEAD OF EVEN LETTING ME KNOW YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY ILLNESS TO HURRY ON MATTERS TO THIS SHAMEFUL AND WICKED EXCESS I DID THE POOR MAN WRONG IN THIS FOR I BELIEVE HE HAD HURRIED THINGS REALLY TO PLEASE ME
8609-283227-0022 HIS FACE HAD LENGTHENED CONSIDERABLY BY THIS TIME AND ITS RUBICUND HUE DECLINED I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD STAND UPON CEREMONY ABOUT IT SIR
8609-283227-0023 BEFORE SUCH A THING SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED I FEEL SO DISGRACED I AM ASHAMED TO LOOK MISTER TEMPLETON IN THE FACE CARRY THAT TABLE INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN DIRECTLY IT'S MY PROPERTY NOW INTERPOSED THE BROKER I'VE BOUGHT IT OF THE CHURCHWARDEN AND PAID FOR IT
8609-283227-0024 BUT I TELL YOU THE WHOLE AFFAIR IS ILLEGAL AND IF YOU CARRY AWAY THAT TABLE I SHALL SEE WHAT THE LAW WILL DO FOR ME I ASSURE YOU I WILL PROSECUTE YOU MYSELF YOU TAKE UP THAT MONEY OR I WILL IT WILL GO TO PAY COUNSEL I GIVE YOU MY WORD IF YOU DO NOT TAKE IT TO QUENCH STRIFE
8609-283227-0025 I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND BUT THE BROKER WAS BEFORE ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE POCKETED THE MONEY JUMPED INTO HIS CART WITH HIS MAN AND DROVE OFF LEAVING THE CHURCHWARDEN AND THE PARSON STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE DISSENTING MINISTER WITH HIS MAHOGANY TABLE ON THE PATH BETWEEN THEM NOW MISTER BROWNRIGG I SAID
8609-283227-0026 LEND ME A HAND TO CARRY THIS TABLE IN AGAIN HE YIELDED NOT GRACIOUSLY THAT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED BUT IN SILENCE OH SIR INTERPOSED YOUNG TOM WHO HAD STOOD BY DURING THE DISPUTE LET ME TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO LIFT IT
8609-283227-0027 AND SO MISTER BROWNRIGG AND I BLUNDERED INTO THE LITTLE PARLOUR WITH OUR BURDEN NOT A GREAT ONE
8609-283227-0028 MISTER TEMPLETON SAT IN A WINDSOR CHAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM EVIDENTLY THE TABLE HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY FROM BEFORE HIM LEAVING HIS POSITION UNCOVERED THE FLOOR WAS STREWED WITH THE BOOKS WHICH HAD LAIN UPON IT HE SAT READING AN OLD FOLIO AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
8609-283227-0029 BUT WHEN WE ENTERED HE ROSE HE WAS A MAN OF MIDDLE SIZE ABOUT FORTY WITH SHORT BLACK HAIR AND OVERHANGING BUSHY EYEBROWS HIS MOUTH INDICATED GREAT FIRMNESS NOT UNMINGLED WITH SWEETNESS AND EVEN WITH HUMOUR HE SMILED AS HE ROSE BUT LOOKED EMBARRASSED
8609-283227-0030 GLANCING FIRST AT THE TABLE THEN AT ME AND THEN AT MISTER BROWNRIGG AS IF BEGGING SOMEBODY TO TELL HIM WHAT TO SAY BUT I DID NOT LEAVE HIM A MOMENT IN THIS PERPLEXITY MISTER TEMPLETON I SAID QUITTING THE TABLE AND HOLDING OUT MY HAND
8609-283227-0031 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOYED LIKE THIS I HAVE MISTER TEMPLETON INTERRUPTED ME I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE WITH ME HE SAID ON NO OTHER GROUND I KNOW IT I KNOW IT I SAID INTERRUPTING HIM IN MY TURN
8609-283227-0032 I BEG YOUR PARDON AND I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE AMENDS FOR IT OFFENCES MUST COME YOU KNOW MISTER TEMPLETON BUT I TRUST I HAVE NOT INCURRED THE WOE THAT FOLLOWS UPON THEM BY MEANS OF WHOM THEY COME FOR I KNEW NOTHING OF IT AND INDEED WAS TOO ILL
8609-283227-0033 MISTER BROWNRIGG I SPOKE IN HEAT WHEN I CAME UP TO YOU AND I AM SURE I DID YOU WRONG I AM CERTAIN YOU HAD NO IMPROPER MOTIVE IN NOT MAKING ME ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR PROCEEDINGS YOU MEANT NO HARM TO ME BUT YOU DID VERY WRONG TOWARDS MISTER TEMPLETON I WILL TRY TO SHOW YOU THAT WHEN I AM WELL AGAIN
8609-283227-0034 BUT BUT YOU MUSTN'T TALK MORE NOW SAID DOCTOR DUNCAN SO I SHOOK HANDS WITH MISTER BROWNRIGG AND WE PARTED I FEAR FROM WHAT I KNOW OF MY CHURCHWARDEN THAT HE WENT HOME WITH THE CONVICTION THAT HE HAD DONE PERFECTLY RIGHT
8609-283227-0035 AND AMONGST THEM BY MISTER TEMPLETON AND HERE I MAY AS WELL SKETCH THE RESULT OF THAT STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE DISSENTING MINISTER
8609-283227-0036 THE GIST OF THE LETTER LAY IN THESE WORDS I CONFESS IT PERPLEXES ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO RECONCILE YOUR CHRISTIAN AND FRIENDLY BEHAVIOUR TO ONE WHOM MOST OF YOUR BRETHREN WOULD CONSIDER AS MUCH BENEATH THEIR NOTICE AS INFERIOR TO THEM IN SOCIAL POSITION
8609-283227-0037 WITH YOUR REMAINING THE MINISTER OF A CHURCH IN WHICH SUCH ENORMITIES AS YOU EMPLOYED YOUR PRIVATE INFLUENCE TO COUNTERACT IN MY CASE ARE NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT CERTAINLY LAWFUL AND RECOGNIZED BY MOST OF ITS MEMBERS AS LIKEWISE EXPEDIENT TO THIS I REPLIED
8609-283227-0038 MY DEAR SIR I DO NOT LIKE WRITING LETTERS ESPECIALLY ON SUBJECTS OF IMPORTANCE THERE ARE A THOUSAND CHANCES OF MISUNDERSTANDING WHEREAS IN A PERSONAL INTERVIEW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF CONTROVERSY BEING HALLOWED BY COMMUNION
8609-283227-0039 TO MISSUS TEMPLETON FOR NOT INVITING HER WITH YOU
8609-283227-0040 HOW YOU COULD BELONG TO A CHURCH WHICH AUTHORIZES THINGS OF WHICH YOU YOURSELF SO HEARTILY DISAPPROVE AND I ANSWER YOU I RETURNED THAT JUST TO SUCH A CHURCH OUR LORD BELONGED I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU OUR LORD BELONGED TO THE JEWISH CHURCH
8609-283227-0041 I WANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH HE ACTED WITH REGARD TO CHURCH RATES CERTAINLY I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU THE PHARISEES DEMANDED A TRIBUTE WHICH IT IS ALLOWED WAS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE TEMPLE AND ITS WORSHIP
8609-283227-0042 OUR LORD DID NOT REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR AUTHORITY NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAD DEGRADED THE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES OF THE JEWISH CHURCH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF A CHILD OF THE CHURCH BUT SAID THAT AS A CHILD HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE AS HE PLEASED
8609-283227-0043 TO THE SUPPORT OF ITS ORDINANCES AND NOT TO BE COMPELLED AFTER SUCH A FASHION THERE I HAVE YOU EXCLAIMED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0044 I GRANT IT IT IS ENTIRELY WRONG A VERY UNCHRISTIAN PROCEEDING BUT OUR LORD DID NOT THEREFORE DESERT THE CHURCH AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO HE PAID THE MONEY LEST HE SHOULD OFFEND AND NOT HAVING IT OF HIS OWN HE HAD TO ASK HIS FATHER FOR IT
8609-283227-0045 OR WHAT CAME TO THE SAME THING MAKE A SERVANT OF HIS FATHER NAMELY A FISH IN THE SEA OF GALILEE
8609-283227-0046 IT IS WRONG TO COMPEL AND WRONG TO REFUSE THE PAYMENT OF A CHURCH RATE I DO NOT SAY EQUALLY WRONG IT IS MUCH WORSE TO COMPEL THAN TO REFUSE YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS RETURNED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0047 MAY I HOPE THAT YOU WILL DO ME THE CREDIT TO BELIEVE THAT IF I SAW CLEARLY THAT THEY WERE THE SAME THING I WOULD NOT HESITATE A MOMENT TO FOLLOW OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE I BELIEVE IT PERFECTLY THEREFORE HOWEVER WE MAY DIFFER WE ARE IN REALITY AT NO STRIFE
8609-283227-0048 BUT IS THERE NOT THIS DIFFERENCE THAT OUR LORD WAS AS YOU SAY A CHILD OF THE JEWISH CHURCH WHICH WAS INDUBITABLY ESTABLISHED BY GOD NOW IF I CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY BELONG TO THE SO CALLED ENGLISH CHURCH WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY CHURCH RATE OR TRIBUTE
8609-283227-0049 SHALL I TELL YOU THE ARGUMENT THE ENGLISH CHURCH MIGHT THEN USE THE CHURCH MIGHT SAY THEN YOU ARE A STRANGER AND NO CHILD THEREFORE LIKE THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WE MAY TAKE TRIBUTE OF YOU SO YOU SEE IT WOULD COME TO THIS THAT DISSENTERS ALONE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PAY CHURCH RATES
8609-283227-0050 WE BOTH LAUGHED AT THIS PUSHING OF THE ARGUMENT TO ILLEGITIMATE CONCLUSIONS THEN I RESUMED BUT THE REAL ARGUMENT IS THAT NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS SHOULD WE SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS OR ANY FAULTS SO LONG AS IT IS THE REPOSITORY OF THE TRUTH SHOULD YOU SEPARATE FROM THE CHURCH
8609-283227-0051 I WILL YIELD THE POINT WHEN YOU CAN SHOW ME THE SAME GROUND FOR BELIEVING THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND THE NATIONAL CHURCH APPOINTED SUCH BY GOD THAT I CAN SHOW YOU AND YOU KNOW ALREADY FOR RECEIVING THE JEWISH CHURCH AS THE APPOINTMENT OF GOD
8609-283227-0052 THAT WOULD INVOLVE A LONG ARGUMENT UPON WHICH THOUGH I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT UPON THE MATTER MYSELF I CANNOT SAY I AM PREPARED TO ENTER AT THIS MOMENT MEANTIME I WOULD JUST ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY A CHILD OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
8609-283227-0053 HAVING RECEIVED FROM IT A THOUSAND INFLUENCES FOR GOOD IF IN NO OTHER WAY YET THROUGH YOUR FATHERS TO FIND IT NO GREAT HARDSHIP AND NOT VERY UNREASONABLE TO PAY A TRIFLE TO KEEP IN REPAIR ONE OF THE TABERNACLES IN WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS WORSHIPPED TOGETHER IF
8609-283227-0054 AS I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW IN SOME IMPERFECT MEASURE GOD IS WORSHIPPED AND THE TRUTH IS PREACHED IN IT MOST WILLINGLY WOULD I PAY THE MONEY I OBJECT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RATE IS COMPULSORY AND THEREIN YOU HAVE OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY
8609-283227-0055 A SILENCE FOLLOWED FOR I HAD TO DEAL WITH AN HONEST MAN WHO WAS THINKING I RESUMED A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES WILL NO DOUBT COME UP TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE MATTER DO NOT SUPPOSE I AM ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU I BELIEVE THAT OUR FATHER OUR ELDER BROTHER
8609-283227-0056 AND THE SPIRIT THAT PROCEEDETH FROM THEM IS TEACHING YOU AS I BELIEVE I TOO AM BEING TAUGHT BY THE SAME WHY THEN SHOULD I BE ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU OF ANYTHING WILL YOU NOT IN HIS GOOD TIME COME TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD HAVE YOU SEE
8609-283227-0057 I AM RELIEVED TO SPEAK MY MIND KNOWING HE WOULD HAVE US SPEAK OUR MINDS TO EACH OTHER BUT I DO NOT WANT TO PROSELYTIZE IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND YOU WILL PROBABLY DO SO ON DIFFERENT GROUNDS FROM ANY I GIVE YOU
8609-283227-0058 AND I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A UNIVERSITY LIKE YOU BUT I'M NO FOOL EITHER I HOPE DON'T BE OFFENDED AT MY QUESTION WOULDN'T YOU BE GLAD TO SEE ME OUT OF YOUR PARISH NOW I BEGAN TO SPEAK BUT HE WENT ON
8609-283227-0059 DON'T YOU REGARD ME AS AN INTERLOPER NOW ONE WHO HAS NO RIGHT TO SPEAK BECAUSE HE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE CHURCH GOD FORBID I ANSWERED IF A WORD OF MINE WOULD MAKE YOU LEAVE MY PARISH TO MORROW I DARE NOT SAY IT
8609-283227-0060 I DO NOT WANT TO INCUR THE REBUKE OF OUR LORD FOR SURELY THE WORDS FORBID HIM NOT INVOLVED SOME REBUKE WOULD IT NOT BE A FEARFUL THING THAT ONE SOUL BECAUSE OF A DEED OF MINE SHOULD RECEIVE A LESS PORTION OF ELEVATION OR COMFORT IN HIS JOURNEY TOWARDS HIS HOME
8609-283227-0061 ARE THERE NOT COUNTLESS MODES OF SAYING THE TRUTH YOU HAVE SOME OF THEM I HOPE I HAVE SOME
8609-283227-0062 WHO WILL NOT HEAR ME PREACH TO THEM IN THE NAME AND LOVE OF GOD MISTER TEMPLETON SPEAK THAT YOU DO KNOW AND TESTIFY THAT YOU HAVE SEEN YOU AND I WILL HELP EACH OTHER IN PROPORTION AS WE SERVE THE MASTER
8609-283227-0063 I ONLY SAY THAT IN SEPARATING FROM US YOU ARE IN EFFECT AND BY YOUR CONDUCT SAYING TO US DO NOT PREACH FOR YOU FOLLOW NOT WITH US I WILL NOT BE GUILTY OF THE SAME TOWARDS YOU YOUR FATHERS DID THE CHURCH NO END OF GOOD BY LEAVING IT
8609-283227-0064 BUT IT IS TIME TO UNITE NOW ONCE MORE FOLLOWED A SILENCE IF PEOPLE COULD ONLY MEET AND LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE FACE SAID MISTER TEMPLETON AT LENGTH THEY MIGHT FIND THERE WAS NOT SUCH A GULF BETWEEN THEM AS THEY HAD FANCIED AND SO WE PARTED
8609-283227-0065 NOW I DO NOT WRITE ALL THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHURCH RATE QUESTION I WRITE IT TO COMMEMORATE THE SPIRIT IN WHICH MISTER TEMPLETON MET ME FOR IT IS OF CONSEQUENCE THAT TWO MEN WHO LOVE THEIR MASTER SHOULD RECOGNIZE EACH THAT THE OTHER DOES SO AND THEREUPON IF NOT BEFORE
8609-283227-0066 AND MANY A TIME ERE HIS DEATH WE CONSULTED TOGETHER ABOUT THINGS THAT BEFELL ONCE HE CAME TO ME ABOUT A LEGAL DIFFICULTY IN CONNEXION WITH THE DEED OF TRUST OF HIS CHAPEL AND ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT HELP HIM MYSELF I DIRECTED HIM TO SUCH HELP AS WAS THOROUGH
8609-283227-0067 AND COST HIM NOTHING I NEED NOT SAY HE NEVER BECAME A CHURCHMAN OR THAT I NEVER EXPECTED HE WOULD ALL HIS MEMORIES OF A RELIGIOUS CHILDHOOD ALL THE SOURCES OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH HAD REFINED AND ELEVATED HIM WERE SURROUNDED WITH OTHER ASSOCIATIONS
8609-283227-0068 THAN THOSE OF THE CHURCH AND HER FORMS THE CHURCH WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER NOT HIS MOTHER AND HE HAD NOT MADE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER TILL COMPARATIVELY LATE IN LIFE BUT WHILE I DO NOT SAY THAT HIS INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIONS TO THE CHURCH WERE LESS STRONG THAN THEY HAD BEEN
8609-283227-0069 I AM SURE THAT HIS FEELINGS WERE MODERATED EVEN CHANGED TOWARDS HER AND THOUGH THIS MAY SEEM OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ONE WHO LOVES THE CHURCH MORE THAN THE BROTHERHOOD IT DOES NOT SEEM OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO ME WHO LOVE THE CHURCH BECAUSE OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF WHICH IT IS THE TYPE AND THE RESTORER
8609-283227-0070 IT WAS LONG BEFORE ANOTHER CHURCH RATE WAS LEVIED IN MARSHMALLOWS AND WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID TAKE PLACE NO ONE DREAMED OF CALLING ON MISTER TEMPLETON FOR HIS SHARE IN IT BUT HAVING HEARD OF IT HE CALLED HIMSELF UPON THE CHURCHWARDEN MISTER BROWNRIGG STILL AND OFFERED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY
8797-294123-0000 TO ACHIEVE A CORRECT APPRECIATION OF THE CHINESE
8797-294123-0001 AND THEN ONE FINE DAY CROSS OVER THE YALU INTO MANCHURIA IT WOULD BE OF EXCEPTIONAL ADVANTAGE TO THE CORRECTNESS OF APPRECIATION DID HE CROSS OVER THE YALU ON THE HEELS OF A HOSTILE AND ALIEN ARMY
8797-294123-0002 WAR IS TO DAY THE FINAL ARBITER IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN AND IT IS AS YET THE FINAL TEST OF THE WORTH WHILENESS OF PEOPLES TESTED THUS THE KOREAN FAILS
8797-294123-0003 HE LACKS THE NERVE TO REMAIN WHEN A STRANGE ARMY CROSSES HIS LAND THE FEW GOODS AND CHATTELS HE MAY HAVE MANAGED TO ACCUMULATE HE PUTS ON HIS BACK ALONG WITH HIS DOORS AND WINDOWS AND AWAY HE HEADS FOR HIS MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES
8797-294123-0004 LATER HE MAY RETURN SANS GOODS CHATTELS DOORS AND WINDOWS IMPELLED BY INSATIABLE CURIOSITY FOR A LOOK SEE BUT IT IS CURIOSITY MERELY A TIMID DEERLIKE CURIOSITY
8797-294123-0005 HE IS PREPARED TO BOUND AWAY ON HIS LONG LEGS AT THE FIRST HINT OF DANGER OR TROUBLE NORTHERN KOREA WAS A DESOLATE LAND WHEN THE JAPANESE PASSED THROUGH VILLAGES AND TOWNS WERE DESERTED
8797-294123-0006 THE FIELDS LAY UNTOUCHED THERE WAS NO PLOUGHING NOR SOWING NO GREEN THINGS GROWING LITTLE OR NOTHING WAS TO BE PURCHASED ONE CARRIED ONE'S OWN FOOD WITH HIM
8797-294123-0007 IN MANY A LONELY VILLAGE NOT AN OUNCE NOR A GRAIN OF ANYTHING COULD BE BOUGHT AND YET THERE MIGHT BE STANDING AROUND SCORES OF WHITE GARMENTED STALWART KOREANS SMOKING YARD LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING CHATTERING CEASELESSLY CHATTERING
8797-294123-0008 LOVE MONEY OR FORCE COULD NOT PROCURE FROM THEM A HORSESHOE OR A HORSESHOE NAIL UPSO WAS THEIR INVARIABLE REPLY UPSO CURSED WORD WHICH MEANS HAVE NOT GOT
8797-294123-0009 THEY HAD TRAMPED PROBABLY FORTY MILES THAT DAY DOWN FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES JUST FOR A LOOK SEE AND FORTY MILES BACK THEY WOULD CHEERFULLY TRAMP CHATTERING ALL THE WAY OVER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN
8797-294123-0010 AND THE GLOOM OF THE LANDSCAPE WILL BE FILLED WITH TALL FLITTING GHOSTS BOUNDING LIKE DEER WITH GREAT SPRINGY STRIDES WHICH ONE CANNOT BUT ENVY THEY HAVE SPLENDID VIGOUR AND FINE BODIES BUT THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEING BEATEN AND ROBBED WITHOUT PROTEST OR RESISTANCE
8797-294123-0011 BY EVERY CHANCE FOREIGNER WHO ENTERS THEIR COUNTRY FROM THIS NERVELESS FORSAKEN KOREAN LAND I RODE DOWN UPON THE SANDY ISLANDS OF THE YALU FOR WEEKS THESE ISLANDS HAD BEEN THE DREAD BETWEEN THE LINES OF TWO FIGHTING ARMIES
8797-294123-0012 THE AIR ABOVE HAD BEEN RENT BY SCREAMING PROJECTILES THE ECHOES OF THE FINAL BATTLE HAD SCARCELY DIED AWAY THE TRAINS OF JAPANESE WOUNDED AND JAPANESE DEAD WERE TRAILING BY
8797-294123-0013 ON THE CONICAL HILL A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY THE RUSSIAN DEAD WERE BEING BURIED IN THEIR TRENCHES AND IN THE SHELL HOLES MADE BY THE JAPANESE AND HERE IN THE THICK OF IT ALL A MAN WAS PLOUGHING GREEN THINGS WERE GROWING
8797-294123-0014 YOUNG ONIONS AND THE MAN WHO WAS WEEDING THEM PAUSED FROM HIS LABOUR LONG ENOUGH TO SELL ME A HANDFUL NEAR BY WAS THE SMOKE BLACKENED RUIN OF THE FARMHOUSE FIRED BY THE RUSSIANS WHEN THEY RETREATED FROM THE RIVERBED TWO MEN WERE REMOVING THE DEBRIS
8797-294123-0015 CLEANING THE CONFUSION PREPARATORY TO REBUILDING THEY WERE CLAD IN BLUE PIGTAILS HUNG DOWN THEIR BACKS I WAS IN CHINA I RODE TO THE SHORE INTO THE VILLAGE OF KUELIAN CHING
8797-294123-0016 THERE WERE NO LOUNGING MEN SMOKING LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING THE PREVIOUS DAY THE RUSSIANS HAD BEEN THERE A BLOODY BATTLE HAD BEEN FOUGHT AND TO DAY THE JAPANESE WERE THERE BUT WHAT WAS THAT TO TALK ABOUT EVERYBODY WAS BUSY
8797-294123-0017 MEN WERE OFFERING EGGS AND CHICKENS AND FRUIT FOR SALE UPON THE STREET AND BREAD AS I LIVE BREAD IN SMALL ROUND LOAVES OR BUNS I RODE ON INTO THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE A TOILING POPULATION WAS IN EVIDENCE
8797-294123-0018 THE HOUSES AND WALLS WERE STRONG AND SUBSTANTIAL STONE AND BRICK REPLACED THE MUD WALLS OF THE KOREAN DWELLINGS TWILIGHT FELL AND DEEPENED AND STILL THE PLOUGHS WENT UP AND DOWN THE FIELDS THE SOWERS FOLLOWING AFTER
8797-294123-0019 TRAINS OF WHEELBARROWS HEAVILY LOADED SQUEAKED BY AND PEKIN CARTS DRAWN BY FROM FOUR TO SIX COWS HORSES MULES PONIES OR JACKASSES COWS EVEN WITH THEIR NEWBORN CALVES TOTTERING ALONG ON PUNY LEGS OUTSIDE THE TRACES
8797-294123-0020 EVERYBODY WORKED EVERYTHING WORKED I SAW A MAN MENDING THE ROAD I WAS IN CHINA I CAME TO THE CITY OF ANTUNG AND LODGED WITH A MERCHANT HE WAS A GRAIN MERCHANT
8797-294123-0021 CORN HE HAD HUNDREDS OF BUSHELS STORED IN GREAT BINS OF STOUT MATTING PEAS AND BEANS IN SACKS AND IN THE BACK YARD HIS MILLSTONES WENT ROUND AND ROUND GRINDING OUT MEAL ALSO IN HIS BACK YARD WERE BUILDINGS CONTAINING VATS SUNK INTO THE GROUND
8797-294123-0022 AND HERE THE TANNERS WERE AT WORK MAKING LEATHER I BOUGHT A MEASURE OF CORN FROM MINE HOST FOR MY HORSES AND HE OVERCHARGED ME THIRTY CENTS I WAS IN CHINA ANTUNG WAS JAMMED WITH JAPANESE TROOPS
8797-294123-0023 IT WAS THE THICK OF WAR BUT IT DID NOT MATTER THE WORK OF ANTUNG WENT ON JUST THE SAME THE SHOPS WERE WIDE OPEN THE STREETS WERE LINED WITH PEDLARS ONE COULD BUY ANYTHING GET ANYTHING MADE
8797-294123-0024 I DINED AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT CLEANSED MYSELF AT A PUBLIC BATH IN A PRIVATE TUB WITH A SMALL BOY TO ASSIST IN THE SCRUBBING I BOUGHT CONDENSED MILK BITTER CANNED VEGETABLES BREAD AND CAKE I REPEAT IT CAKE GOOD CAKE
8797-294123-0025 I BOUGHT KNIVES FORKS AND SPOONS GRANITE WARE DISHES AND MUGS THERE WERE HORSESHOES AND HORSESHOERS A WORKER IN IRON REALIZED FOR ME NEW DESIGNS OF MINE FOR MY TENT POLES MY SHOES WERE SENT OUT TO BE REPAIRED
8797-294123-0026 A BARBER SHAMPOOED MY HAIR A SERVANT RETURNED WITH CORN BEEF IN TINS A BOTTLE OF PORT ANOTHER OF COGNAC AND BEER
8797-294123-0027 TO WASH OUT FROM MY THROAT THE DUST OF AN ARMY IT WAS THE LAND OF CANAAN I WAS IN CHINA THE KOREAN IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INEFFICIENCY OF UTTER WORTHLESSNESS
8797-294123-0028 THE CHINESE IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INDUSTRY FOR SHEER WORK NO WORKER IN THE WORLD CAN COMPARE WITH HIM WORK IS THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS IT IS HIS SOLUTION OF EXISTENCE
8797-294123-0029 LIBERTY TO HIM EPITOMIZES ITSELF IN ACCESS TO THE MEANS OF TOIL TO TILL THE SOIL AND LABOUR INTERMINABLY WITH RUDE IMPLEMENTS AND UTENSILS IS ALL HE ASKS OF LIFE AND OF THE POWERS THAT BE
8797-294123-0030 WORK IS WHAT HE DESIRES ABOVE ALL THINGS AND HE WILL WORK AT ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY DURING THE TAKING OF THE TAKU FORTS HE CARRIED SCALING LADDERS AT THE HEADS OF THE STORMING COLUMNS AND PLANTED THEM AGAINST THE WALLS
8797-294123-0031 HE DID THIS NOT FROM A SENSE OF PATRIOTISM BUT FOR THE INVADING FOREIGN DEVILS BECAUSE THEY PAID HIM A DAILY WAGE OF FIFTY CENTS HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED BY WAR HE ACCEPTS IT AS HE DOES RAIN AND SUNSHINE THE CHANGING OF THE SEASONS AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA
8797-294123-0032 HE PREPARES FOR IT ENDURES IT AND SURVIVES IT AND WHEN THE TIDE OF BATTLE SWEEPS BY
8797-294123-0033 HE IS SEEN CALMLY BENDING TO HIS USUAL TASKS NAY WAR ITSELF BEARS FRUITS WHEREOF HE MAY PICK BEFORE THE DEAD ARE COLD OR THE BURIAL SQUADS HAVE ARRIVED HE IS OUT ON THE FIELD
8797-294123-0034 STRIPPING THE MANGLED BODIES COLLECTING THE SHRAPNEL AND FERRETING IN THE SHELL HOLES FOR SLIVERS AND FRAGMENTS OF IRON THE CHINESE IS NO COWARD
8797-294123-0035 HE DOES NOT HIDE AWAY HIS CHICKENS AND HIS EGGS NOR ANY OTHER COMMODITY HE POSSESSES HE PROCEEDS AT ONCE TO OFFER THEM FOR SALE NOR IS HE TO BE BULLIED INTO LOWERING HIS PRICE
8797-294123-0036 HE HAS TWO LARGE PEARS SAVED OVER FROM LAST YEAR WHICH HE WILL SELL FOR FIVE SEN OR FOR THE SAME PRICE THREE SMALL PEARS WHAT IF ONE SOLDIER PERSIST IN TAKING AWAY WITH HIM THREE LARGE PEARS WHAT IF THERE BE TWENTY OTHER SOLDIERS JOSTLING ABOUT HIM
8797-294123-0037 AND THE SOLDIER RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FLIGHT
8797-294123-0038 NOR IS THE CHINESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE WHICH HE HAS BEEN SO OFTEN DESIGNATED HE IS NOT SO ILL DISPOSED TOWARD NEW IDEAS AND NEW METHODS AS HIS HISTORY WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE TRUE
8797-294123-0039 HIS FORMS CUSTOMS AND METHODS HAVE BEEN PERMANENT THESE MANY CENTURIES BUT THIS HAS BEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE LEARNED CLASSES AND THAT THESE GOVERNING SCHOLARS FOUND THEIR SALVATION LAY IN SUPPRESSING ALL PROGRESSIVE IDEAS
8797-294123-0040 AND BEEN SPREAD BY THEIR PAMPHLETS AND PROPAGANDISTS ORIGINALITY AND ENTERPRISE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED IN THE CHINESE FOR SCORES OF GENERATIONS ONLY HAS REMAINED TO HIM INDUSTRY
8797-294123-0041 ON THE OTHER HAND HIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEW IDEAS HAS BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED WHEREVER HE HAS ESCAPED BEYOND THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED UPON HIM BY HIS GOVERNMENT SO FAR AS THE BUSINESS MAN IS CONCERNED HE HAS GRASPED FAR MORE CLEARLY THE WESTERN CODE OF BUSINESS
8797-294123-0042 THE WESTERN ETHICS OF BUSINESS THAN HAS THE JAPANESE HE HAS LEARNED AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO KEEP HIS WORD OR HIS BOND AS YET THE JAPANESE BUSINESS MAN HAS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN HE HAS SIGNED A TIME CONTRACT
8797-294123-0043 AND WHEN CHANGING CONDITIONS CAUSE HIM TO LOSE BY IT THE JAPANESE MERCHANT CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT IT IS BEYOND HIS COMPREHENSION AND REPULSIVE TO HIS COMMON SENSE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT AND THEREBY LOSE MONEY
8797-294123-0044 HE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE CHANGING CONDITIONS THEMSELVES ABSOLVE HIM AND IN SO FAR ADAPTABLE AS HE HAS SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE IN OTHER RESPECTS
8797-294123-0045 HERE WE HAVE THE CHINESE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF HIM OCCUPYING A VAST LAND OF IMMENSE NATURAL RESOURCES RESOURCES OF A TWENTIETH CENTURY AGE OF A MACHINE AGE
8797-294123-0046 RESOURCES OF COAL AND IRON WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF COMMERCIAL CIVILIZATION
8797-294123-0047 TRULY WOULD HE OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE THE MUCH HERALDED YELLOW PERIL WERE IT NOT FOR HIS PRESENT MANAGEMENT THIS MANAGEMENT HIS GOVERNMENT IS SET CRYSTALLIZED IT IS WHAT BINDS HIM DOWN TO BUILDING AS HIS FATHERS BUILT
8797-294123-0048 THE GOVERNING CLASS ENTRENCHED BY THE PRECEDENT AND POWER OF CENTURIES AND BY THE STAMP IT HAS PUT UPON HIS MIND WILL NEVER FREE HIM IT WOULD BE THE SUICIDE OF THE GOVERNING CLASS AND THE GOVERNING CLASS KNOWS IT
8797-294123-0049 COMES NOW THE JAPANESE ON THE STREETS OF ANTUNG OF FENG WANG CHANG OR OF ANY OTHER MANCHURIAN CITY THE FOLLOWING IS A FAMILIAR SCENE
8797-294123-0050 ON ONE SIDE SQUATS A CHINESE CIVILIAN ON HIS HAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE SQUATS A JAPANESE SOLDIER
8797-294123-0051 THE OTHER NODS UNDERSTANDING SWEEPS THE DUST SLATE LEVEL WITH HIS HAND AND WITH HIS FOREFINGER INSCRIBES SIMILAR CHARACTERS THEY ARE TALKING THEY CANNOT SPEAK TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY CAN WRITE
8797-294123-0052 LONG AGO ONE BORROWED THE OTHER'S WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND LONG BEFORE THAT UNTOLD GENERATIONS AGO THEY DIVERGED FROM A COMMON ROOT THE ANCIENT MONGOL STOCK THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES
8797-294123-0053 DIFFERENTIATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVERSE CONDITIONS AND INFUSIONS OF OTHER BLOOD BUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR BEING TWISTED INTO THE FIBRES OF THEM IS A HERITAGE IN COMMON A SAMENESS IN KIND WHICH TIME HAS NOT OBLITERATED
8797-294123-0054 THE INFUSION OF OTHER BLOOD MALAY PERHAPS HAS MADE THE JAPANESE A RACE OF MASTERY AND POWER A FIGHTING RACE THROUGH ALL ITS HISTORY A RACE WHICH HAS ALWAYS DESPISED COMMERCE AND EXALTED FIGHTING TO DAY
8797-294123-0055 EQUIPPED WITH THE FINEST MACHINES AND SYSTEMS OF DESTRUCTION THE CAUCASIAN MIND HAS DEVISED HANDLING MACHINES AND SYSTEMS WITH REMARKABLE AND DEADLY ACCURACY THIS REJUVENESCENT JAPANESE RACE HAS EMBARKED ON A COURSE OF CONQUEST THE GOAL OF WHICH NO MAN KNOWS
8797-294123-0056 THE HEAD MEN OF JAPAN ARE DREAMING AMBITIOUSLY AND THE PEOPLE ARE DREAMING BLINDLY A NAPOLEONIC DREAM AND TO THIS DREAM THE JAPANESE CLINGS AND WILL CLING WITH BULL DOG TENACITY THE SOLDIER SHOUTING NIPPON BANZAI
8797-294123-0057 HER SOLE SUPPORT MAY GO TO THE FRONT ARE BOTH EXPRESSING THE UNANIMITY OF THE DREAM THE LATE DISTURBANCE IN THE FAR EAST MARKED THE CLASHING OF THE DREAMS FOR THE SLAV TOO IS DREAMING GREATLY
8797-294123-0058 GRANTING THAT THE JAPANESE CAN HURL BACK THE SLAV AND THAT THE TWO GREAT BRANCHES OF THE ANGLO SAXON RACE DO NOT DESPOIL HIM OF HIS SPOILS THE JAPANESE DREAM TAKES ON SUBSTANTIALITY
8797-294123-0059 BUT GIVEN POOR EMPTY KOREA FOR A BREEDING COLONY AND MANCHURIA FOR A GRANARY AND AT ONCE THE JAPANESE BEGINS TO INCREASE BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS EVEN SO HE WOULD NOT OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE A BROWN PERIL
8797-294123-0060 HE HAS NOT THE TIME IN WHICH TO GROW AND REALIZE THE DREAM HE IS ONLY FORTY FIVE MILLIONS AND SO FAST DOES THE ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION OF THE PLANET HURRY ON THE PLANET'S PARTITION AMONGST THE WESTERN PEOPLES THAT BEFORE HE COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE REQUISITE TO MENACE
8797-294123-0061 HE WOULD SEE THE WESTERN GIANTS IN POSSESSION OF THE VERY STUFF OF HIS DREAM THE MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD LIES NOT IN THE LITTLE BROWN MAN BUT IN THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF YELLOW MEN SHOULD THE LITTLE BROWN MAN UNDERTAKE THEIR MANAGEMENT
8797-294123-0062 THE CHINESE IS NOT DEAD TO NEW IDEAS HE IS AN EFFICIENT WORKER MAKES A GOOD SOLDIER AND IS WEALTHY IN THE ESSENTIAL MATERIALS OF A MACHINE AGE UNDER A CAPABLE MANAGEMENT HE WILL GO FAR
8797-294123-0063 THE JAPANESE IS PREPARED AND FIT TO UNDERTAKE THIS MANAGEMENT NOT ONLY HAS HE PROVED HIMSELF AN APT IMITATOR OF WESTERN MATERIAL PROGRESS A STURDY WORKER AND A CAPABLE ORGANIZER BUT HE IS FAR MORE FIT TO MANAGE THE CHINESE THAN ARE WE
8797-294123-0064 THE BAFFLING ENIGMA OF THE CHINESE CHARACTER IS NO BAFFLING ENIGMA TO HIM HE UNDERSTANDS AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES NOR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MENTAL PROCESSES ARE LARGELY THE SAME
8797-294123-0065 HE THINKS WITH THE SAME THOUGHT SYMBOLS AS DOES THE CHINESE AND HE THINKS IN THE SAME PECULIAR GROOVES HE GOES ON WHERE WE ARE BALKED BY THE OBSTACLES OF INCOMPREHENSION HE TAKES THE TURNING WHICH WE CANNOT PERCEIVE
8797-294123-0066 TWISTS AROUND THE OBSTACLE AND PRESTO IS OUT OF SIGHT IN THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE CHINESE MIND WHERE WE CANNOT FOLLOW THE CHINESE HAS BEEN CALLED THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE AND WELL HE HAS MERITED IT DOZING AS HE HAS THROUGH THE AGES
8797-294123-0067 AND AS TRULY WAS THE JAPANESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE UP TO A GENERATION AGO
8797-294123-0068 THE IDEAS OF THE WEST WERE THE LEAVEN WHICH QUICKENED THE JAPANESE AND THE IDEAS OF THE WEST TRANSMITTED BY THE JAPANESE MIND INTO IDEAS JAPANESE MAY WELL MAKE THE LEAVEN POWERFUL ENOUGH TO QUICKEN THE CHINESE
8797-294123-0069 WE HAVE HAD AFRICA FOR THE AFRIKANDER AND AT NO DISTANT DAY WE SHALL HEAR ASIA FOR THE ASIATIC FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INDEFATIGABLE WORKERS DEFT INTELLIGENT AND UNAFRAID TO DIE AROUSED AND REJUVENESCENT
8797-294123-0070 MANAGED AND GUIDED BY FORTY FIVE MILLION ADDITIONAL HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE SPLENDID FIGHTING ANIMALS SCIENTIFIC AND MODERN CONSTITUTE THAT MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD WHICH HAS BEEN WELL NAMED THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0071 THE POSSIBILITY OF RACE ADVENTURE HAS NOT PASSED AWAY WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF OUR OWN THE SLAV IS JUST GIRDING HIMSELF UP TO BEGIN WHY MAY NOT THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN START OUT ON AN ADVENTURE AS TREMENDOUS AS OUR OWN AND MORE STRIKINGLY UNIQUE
8797-294123-0072 IT IS NOT THE NATURE OF LIFE TO BELIEVE ITSELF WEAK THERE IS SUCH A THING AS RACE EGOTISM AS WELL AS CREATURE EGOTISM AND A VERY GOOD THING IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE WESTERN WORLD WILL NOT PERMIT THE RISE OF THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0073 IT ADVANCES THIS IDEA WITH PERSISTENCY AND DELIVERS ITSELF OF LONG ARGUMENTS SHOWING HOW AND WHY THIS MENACE WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO ARISE
8797-294123-0074 THE WESTERN WORLD IS WARNED IF NOT ARMED AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF IT IN THE SECOND PLACE THERE IS A WEAKNESS INHERENT IN THE BROWN MAN WHICH WILL BRING HIS ADVENTURE TO NAUGHT FROM THE WEST HE HAS BORROWED ALL OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT AND PASSED OUR ETHICAL ACHIEVEMENT BY
8797-294123-0075 OUR ENGINES OF PRODUCTION AND DESTRUCTION HE HAS MADE HIS WHAT WAS ONCE SOLELY OURS HE NOW DUPLICATES RIVALLING OUR MERCHANTS IN THE COMMERCE OF THE EAST THRASHING THE RUSSIAN ON SEA AND LAND A MARVELLOUS IMITATOR TRULY
8797-294123-0076 BUT IMITATING US ONLY IN THINGS MATERIAL THINGS SPIRITUAL CANNOT BE IMITATED THEY MUST BE FELT AND LIVED WOVEN INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF LIFE AND HERE THE JAPANESE FAILS
8797-294123-0077 IT REQUIRED NO REVOLUTION OF HIS NATURE TO LEARN TO CALCULATE THE RANGE AND FIRE A FIELD GUN OR TO MARCH THE GOOSE STEP IT WAS A MERE MATTER OF TRAINING OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF OUR INTELLECT
8797-294123-0078 IT IS KNOWLEDGE AND KNOWLEDGE LIKE COIN IS INTERCHANGEABLE IT IS NOT WRAPPED UP IN THE HEREDITY OF THE NEW BORN CHILD BUT IS SOMETHING TO BE ACQUIRED AFTERWARD
8797-294123-0079 OUR SOUL STUFF IS NOT A COIN TO BE POCKETED BY THE FIRST CHANCE COMER THE JAPANESE CANNOT POCKET IT ANY MORE THAN HE CAN THRILL TO SHORT SAXON WORDS OR WE CAN THRILL TO CHINESE HIEROGLYPHICS THE LEOPARD CANNOT CHANGE ITS SPOTS NOR CAN THE JAPANESE
8797-294123-0080 NOR CAN WE WE ARE THUMBED BY THE AGES INTO WHAT WE ARE AND BY NO CONSCIOUS INWARD EFFORT CAN WE IN A DAY RETHUMB OURSELVES NOR CAN THE JAPANESE IN A DAY OR A GENERATION RETHUMB HIMSELF IN OUR IMAGE
8797-294123-0081 BACK OF OUR OWN GREAT RACE ADVENTURE BACK OF OUR ROBBERIES BY SEA AND LAND OUR LUSTS AND VIOLENCES AND ALL THE EVIL THINGS WE HAVE DONE THERE IS A CERTAIN INTEGRITY A STERNNESS OF CONSCIENCE A MELANCHOLY RESPONSIBILITY OF LIFE
8797-294123-0082 A SYMPATHY AND COMRADESHIP AND WARM HUMAN FEEL WHICH IS OURS INDUBITABLY OURS AND WHICH WE CANNOT TEACH TO THE ORIENTAL AS WE WOULD TEACH LOGARITHMS OR THE TRAJECTORY OF PROJECTILES
8797-294123-0083 THAT WE HAVE GROPED FOR THE WAY OF RIGHT CONDUCT AND AGONIZED OVER THE SOUL BETOKENS OUR SPIRITUAL ENDOWMENT THOUGH WE HAVE STRAYED OFTEN AND FAR FROM RIGHTEOUSNESS THE VOICES OF THE SEERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RAISED
8797-294123-0084 AND WE HAVE HARKED BACK TO THE BIDDING OF CONSCIENCE THE COLOSSAL FACT OF OUR HISTORY IS THAT WE HAVE MADE THE RELIGION OF JESUS CHRIST OUR RELIGION NO MATTER HOW DARK IN ERROR AND DEED OURS HAS BEEN A HISTORY OF SPIRITUAL STRUGGLE AND ENDEAVOUR
8797-294123-0085 WE ARE PRE EMINENTLY A RELIGIOUS RACE WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT WE ARE A RIGHT SEEKING RACE
8797-294123-0086 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY HAVE NO SOUL WAS HER ANSWER THIS MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT THE JAPANESE IS WITHOUT SOUL BUT IT SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE THE ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR SOULS AND THIS WOMAN'S SOUL
8797-294123-0087 THERE WAS NO FEEL NO SPEECH NO RECOGNITION THIS WESTERN SOUL DID NOT DREAM THAT THE EASTERN SOUL EXISTED IT WAS SO DIFFERENT SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT RELIGION AS A BATTLE FOR THE RIGHT IN OUR SENSE OF RIGHT
8797-294123-0088 AS A YEARNING AND A STRIFE FOR SPIRITUAL GOOD AND PURITY IS UNKNOWN TO THE JAPANESE MEASURED BY WHAT RELIGION MEANS TO US THE JAPANESE IS A RACE WITHOUT RELIGION YET IT HAS A RELIGION
8797-294123-0089 AS ONE JAPANESE HAS WRITTEN OUR REFLECTION BROUGHT INTO PROMINENCE NOT SO MUCH THE MORAL AS THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO US THE COUNTRY IS MORE THAN LAND AND SOIL FROM WHICH TO MINE GOLD OR REAP GRAIN
8797-294123-0090 IT IS THE SACRED ABODE OF THE GODS THE SPIRIT OF OUR FOREFATHERS TO US THE EMPEROR IS MORE THAN THE ARCH CONSTABLE OF A REICHSSTAAT OR EVEN THE PATRON OF A KULTURSTAAT HE IS THE BODILY REPRESENTATIVE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH
8797-294123-0091 BLENDING IN HIS PERSON ITS POWER AND ITS MERCY THE RELIGION OF JAPAN IS PRACTICALLY A WORSHIP OF THE STATE ITSELF PATRIOTISM IS THE EXPRESSION OF THIS WORSHIP THE JAPANESE MIND DOES NOT SPLIT HAIRS AS TO WHETHER THE EMPEROR IS HEAVEN INCARNATE OR THE STATE INCARNATE
8797-294123-0092 SO FAR AS THE JAPANESE ARE CONCERNED THE EMPEROR LIVES IS HIMSELF DEITY THE EMPEROR IS THE OBJECT TO LIVE FOR AND TO DIE FOR THE JAPANESE IS NOT AN INDIVIDUALIST
8797-294123-0093 HE HAS DEVELOPED NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS INSTEAD OF MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN HIS OWN MORAL WELFARE EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT IS THE WELFARE OF THE STATE THE HONOUR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PER SE DOES NOT EXIST
8797-294123-0094 ONLY EXISTS THE HONOUR OF THE STATE WHICH IS HIS HONOUR HE DOES NOT LOOK UPON HIMSELF AS A FREE AGENT WORKING OUT HIS OWN PERSONAL SALVATION SPIRITUAL AGONIZING IS UNKNOWN TO HIM HE HAS A SENSE OF CALM TRUST IN FATE
8797-294123-0095 A QUIET SUBMISSION TO THE INEVITABLE A STOIC COMPOSURE IN SIGHT OF DANGER OR CALAMITY A DISDAIN OF LIFE AND FRIENDLINESS WITH DEATH HE RELATES HIMSELF TO THE STATE AS AMONGST BEES THE WORKER IS RELATED TO THE HIVE HIMSELF NOTHING
8797-294123-0096 THE STATE EVERYTHING HIS REASONS FOR EXISTENCE THE EXALTATION AND GLORIFICATION OF THE STATE THE MOST ADMIRED QUALITY TO DAY OF THE JAPANESE IS HIS PATRIOTISM
8797-294123-0097 THE WESTERN WORLD IS IN RHAPSODIES OVER IT UNWITTINGLY MEASURING THE JAPANESE PATRIOTISM BY ITS OWN CONCEPTIONS OF PATRIOTISM FOR GOD MY COUNTRY AND THE CZAR CRIES THE RUSSIAN PATRIOT
8797-294123-0098 BUT IN THE JAPANESE MIND THERE IS NO DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE THREE THE EMPEROR IS THE EMPEROR AND GOD AND COUNTRY AS WELL THE PATRIOTISM OF THE JAPANESE IS BLIND AND UNSWERVING LOYALTY TO WHAT IS PRACTICALLY AN ABSOLUTISM
8797-294123-0099 THE EMPEROR CAN DO NO WRONG NOR CAN THE FIVE AMBITIOUS GREAT MEN WHO HAVE HIS EAR AND CONTROL THE DESTINY OF JAPAN NO GREAT RACE ADVENTURE CAN GO FAR NOR ENDURE LONG WHICH HAS NO DEEPER FOUNDATION THAN MATERIAL SUCCESS
8797-294123-0100 NO HIGHER PROMPTING THAN CONQUEST FOR CONQUEST'S SAKE AND MERE RACE GLORIFICATION TO GO FAR AND TO ENDURE IT MUST HAVE BEHIND IT AN ETHICAL IMPULSE A SINCERELY CONCEIVED RIGHTEOUSNESS
8797-294123-0101 BUT IT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ABOVE POSTULATE IS ITSELF A PRODUCT OF WESTERN RACE EGOTISM URGED BY OUR BELIEF IN OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FOSTERED BY A FAITH IN OURSELVES WHICH MAY BE AS ERRONEOUS AS ARE MOST FOND RACE FANCIES
8797-294123-0102 SO BE IT THE WORLD IS WHIRLING FASTER TO DAY THAN EVER BEFORE IT HAS GAINED IMPETUS AFFAIRS RUSH TO CONCLUSION THE FAR EAST IS THE POINT OF CONTACT OF THE ADVENTURING WESTERN PEOPLE AS WELL AS OF THE ASIATIC
8797-294123-0103 WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR OUR CHILDREN'S TIME NOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE SHALL OURSELVES SEE AND LARGELY DETERMINE THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN FENG WANG CHENG MANCHURIA
8838-298545-0000 HE SAT IN SILENCE WITH HIS FINE SHOULDERS BOWED AND HIS HEAD UPON HIS HANDS OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GRIMY SURGERY WINDOW OVER A FOREGROUND OF BLACKENED BRICK AND SLATE A LINE OF ENORMOUS CHIMNEYS LIKE CYCLOPEAN PILLARS
8838-298545-0001 UPHELD THE LOWERING DUN COLOURED CLOUD BANK FOR SIX DAYS IN THE WEEK THEY SPOUTED SMOKE BUT TO DAY THE FURNACE FIRES WERE BANKED FOR IT WAS SUNDAY SORDID AND POLLUTING GLOOM HUNG OVER A DISTRICT BLIGHTED AND BLASTED BY THE GREED OF MAN
8838-298545-0002 HE SHOULD BE BACK AGAIN AT THE UNIVERSITY COMPLETING THE LAST YEAR WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM HIS MEDICAL DEGREE BUT ALAS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY WITH WHICH TO PAY HIS CLASS FEES NOR COULD HE IMAGINE HOW HE COULD PROCURE IT
8838-298545-0003 HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS BLACK MEDITATION BY THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR OLDACRE HIMSELF A LARGE CLEAN SHAVEN RESPECTABLE MAN WITH A PRIM MANNER AND AN AUSTERE FACE HE HAD PROSPERED EXCEEDINGLY BY THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL CHURCH INTEREST
8838-298545-0004 AND THE RULE OF HIS LIFE WAS NEVER BY WORD OR ACTION TO RUN A RISK OF OFFENDING THE SENTIMENT WHICH HAD MADE HIM HIS STANDARD OF RESPECTABILITY AND OF DIGNITY WAS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH AND HE EXPECTED THE SAME FROM HIS ASSISTANTS
8838-298545-0005 HIS APPEARANCE AND WORDS WERE ALWAYS VAGUELY BENEVOLENT A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER THE DESPONDENT STUDENT HE WOULD TEST THE REALITY OF THIS PHILANTHROPY I BEG YOUR PARDON DOCTOR OLDACRE SAID HE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR

8838-298545-0009 CONSIDER SIR HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF MEDICAL STUDENTS THERE ARE IN THIS COUNTRY NO DOUBT THERE ARE MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEIR FEES AM I TO PROVIDE FOR THEM ALL OR WHY SHOULD I MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN YOUR FAVOUR I AM GRIEVED AND DISAPPOINTED MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0010 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT ME INTO THE PAINFUL POSITION OF HAVING TO REFUSE YOU HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND WALKED WITH OFFENDED DIGNITY OUT OF THE SURGERY THE STUDENT SMILED BITTERLY AND TURNED TO HIS WORK OF MAKING UP THE MORNING PRESCRIPTIONS
8838-298545-0011 HE ONLY EXCELLED IN HIS STRENGTH AND WHERE WAS HE TO FIND A CUSTOMER FOR THAT BUT THE WAYS OF FATE ARE STRANGE AND HIS CUSTOMER WAS AT HAND LOOK Y'ERE SAID A VOICE AT THE DOOR MONTGOMERY LOOKED UP
8838-298545-0012 FOR THE VOICE WAS A LOUD AND RASPING ONE A YOUNG MAN STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE A STOCKY BULL NECKED YOUNG MINER IN TWEED SUNDAY CLOTHES AND AN AGGRESSIVE NECK TIE HE WAS A SINISTER LOOKING FIGURE WITH DARK INSOLENT EYES
8838-298545-0013 AND THE JAW AND THROAT OF A BULLDOG LOOK Y'ERE SAID HE AGAIN WHY HAST THOU NOT SENT T MEDICINE OOP AS THY MASTER ORDERED MONTGOMERY HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE BRUTAL FRANKNESS OF THE NORTHERN WORKER AT FIRST IT HAD ENRAGED HIM
8838-298545-0014 BUT AFTER A TIME HE HAD GROWN CALLOUS TO IT AND ACCEPTED IT AS IT WAS MEANT BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT WAS INSOLENCE BRUTAL OVERBEARING INSOLENCE WITH PHYSICAL MENACE BEHIND IT WHAT NAME HE ASKED COLDLY
8838-298545-0015 THE PROVOCATION WAS SO GROSS THE INSULT SO UNPROVOKED THAT HE COULD HAVE NONE OF THOSE QUALMS WHICH TAKE THE EDGE OFF A MAN'S METTLE HE FINISHED SEALING THE BOTTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS OCCUPIED AND HE ADDRESSED IT AND PLACED IT CAREFULLY IN THE RACK
8838-298545-0016 LOOK HERE SAID HE TURNING ROUND TO THE MINER YOUR MEDICINE WILL BE MADE UP IN ITS TURN AND SENT DOWN TO YOU I DON'T ALLOW FOLK IN THE SURGERY WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE WAITING ROOM IF YOU WISH TO WAIT AT ALL YOONG MAN SAID THE MINER
8838-298545-0017 THE BLOWS WERE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS A SAVAGE SWING WHICH WHISTLED PAST MONTGOMERY'S EAR AND A STRAIGHT DRIVE WHICH TOOK THE WORKMAN ON THE CHIN LUCK WAS WITH THE ASSISTANT THAT SINGLE WHIZZING UPPERCUT AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS DELIVERED
8838-298545-0018 HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE ASSISTANT BREATHING FIERCELY THROUGH HIS NOSE BUT NO ANSWER CAME THE MAN WAS INSENSIBLE AND THEN THE DANGER OF HIS POSITION CAME UPON MONTGOMERY AND HE TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS ANTAGONIST
8838-298545-0019 A SUNDAY THE IMMACULATE DOCTOR OLDACRE WITH HIS PIOUS CONNECTION A SAVAGE BRAWL WITH A PATIENT HE WOULD IRRETRIEVABLY LOSE HIS SITUATION IF THE FACTS CAME OUT IT WAS NOT MUCH OF A SITUATION BUT HE COULD NOT GET ANOTHER WITHOUT A REFERENCE
8838-298545-0020 LOOSENED HIS COLLAR AND SQUEEZED THE SURGERY SPONGE OVER HIS FACE HE SAT UP AT LAST WITH A GASP AND A SCOWL DOMN THEE THOU'S SPOILT MY NECK TIE SAID HE MOPPING UP THE WATER FROM HIS BREAST
8838-298545-0021 I'M SORRY I HIT YOU SO HARD SAID MONTGOMERY APOLOGETICALLY THOU HIT ME HARD I COULD STAN SUCH FLY FLAPPIN ALL DAY TWAS THIS HERE PRESS THAT CRACKED MY PATE FOR ME AND THOU ART A LOOKY MAN TO BE ABLE TO BOAST AS THOU HAST OUTED ME
8838-298545-0022 AND NOW I'D BE OBLIGED TO THEE IF THOU WILT GIVE ME T WIFE'S MEDICINE MONTGOMERY GLADLY MADE IT UP AND HANDED IT TO THE MINER YOU ARE WEAK STILL SAID HE WON'T YOU STAY AWHILE AND REST T WIFE WANTS HER MEDICINE
8838-298545-0023 SAID THE MAN AND LURCHED OUT AT THE DOOR THE ASSISTANT LOOKING AFTER HIM SAW HIM ROLLING WITH AN UNCERTAIN STEP DOWN THE STREET UNTIL A FRIEND MET HIM AND THEY WALKED ON ARM IN ARM THE MAN SEEMED IN HIS ROUGH NORTHERN FASHION TO BEAR NO GRUDGE
8838-298545-0024 YET ALL DAY HE WAS AWARE OF A SENSE OF VAGUE UNEASINESS WHICH SHARPENED INTO DISMAY WHEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS INFORMED THAT THREE GENTLEMEN HAD CALLED AND WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE SURGERY A CORONER'S INQUEST
8838-298545-0025 ABOVE ALL WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT FROM HIM WAS A MOST INEXPLICABLE PROBLEM THE FIRST WAS SORLEY WILSON THE SON OF THE OWNER OF THE NONPAREIL COALPIT HE WAS A YOUNG BLOOD OF TWENTY HEIR TO A FORTUNE A KEEN SPORTSMAN
8838-298545-0026 AND DOWN FOR THE EASTER VACATION FROM MAGDALENE COLLEGE HE SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF THE SURGERY TABLE LOOKING IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE AT MONTGOMERY AND TWISTING THE ENDS OF HIS SMALL BLACK WAXED MOUSTACHE THE SECOND WAS PURVIS THE PUBLICAN
8838-298545-0027 AND HE ALSO LEANED FORWARD IN SILENCE FROM HIS CHAIR A FAT RED HAND UPON EITHER KNEE AND STARED CRITICALLY AT THE YOUNG ASSISTANT SO DID THE THIRD VISITOR FAWCETT THE HORSE BREAKER WHO LEANED BACK HIS LONG THIN LEGS WITH THEIR BOXCLOTH RIDING GAITERS
8838-298545-0028 NO IT'S OFF IT'S NOWT STAND OOP LAD LET'S SEE THEE STANDIN IT WAS THE PUBLICAN WHO SPOKE MONTGOMERY OBEYED HE WOULD LEARN ALL ABOUT IT NO DOUBT IF HE WERE PATIENT
8838-298545-0029 A HUNDRED AND THIRTY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IF HE'S AN OUNCE WELL THE MASTER DOESN'T SCALE MUCH MORE THAN THAT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS HOG FAT AND LIVING HIGH WORK THE GREASE OUT OF HIM AND I LAY THERE'S NO GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
8838-298545-0030 HAVE YOU BEEN WEIGHED LATELY MISTER MONTGOMERY IT WAS THE FIRST DIRECT QUESTION WHICH HAD BEEN ASKED HIM HE HAD STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THEM LIKE A HORSE AT A FAIR AND HE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO WONDER WHETHER HE WAS MORE ANGRY OR AMUSED I AM JUST ELEVEN STONE SAID HE
8838-298545-0031 BUT TRAININ FOR EVERYDAY WORK AIN'T THE SAME AS TRAININ WITH A TRAINER AND I DARE BET WITH ALL RESPEC TO YOUR OPINION MISTER WILSON THAT THERE'S HALF A STONE OF TALLOW ON HIM AT THIS MINUTE THE YOUNG CANTAB PUT HIS FINGERS ON THE ASSISTANT'S UPPER ARM
8838-298545-0032 THEN WITH HIS OTHER HAND ON HIS WRIST HE BENT THE FOREARM SHARPLY AND FELT THE BICEPS AS ROUND AND HARD AS A CRICKET BALL SPRING UP UNDER HIS FINGERS FEEL THAT SAID HE THE PUBLICAN AND HORSE BREAKER FELT IT WITH AN AIR OF REVERENCE
8838-298545-0033 GOOD LAD HE'LL DO YET CRIED PURVIS GENTLEMEN SAID MONTGOMERY I THINK THAT YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE BOON VERY PATIENT WITH YOU
8838-298545-0034 AND NOW I MUST REALLY BEG THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TELL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER THEY ALL SAT DOWN IN THEIR SERIOUS BUSINESS LIKE WAY THAT'S EASY DONE MISTER MONTGOMERY SAID THE FAT VOICED PUBLICAN BUT BEFORE SAYIN ANYTHING WE HAD TO WAIT AND SEE WHETHER
8838-298545-0035 FOR IT WOULD BE SOMETHIN NEW TO FIND ISAAC FAWCETT AS A SPOIL SPORT WELL THEN WE WILL MAKE UP THE HUNDRED FOR THE STAKE AMONG US AND THE FIGHT STANDS ALWAYS SUPPOSIN THE YOUNG MAN IS WILLIN EXCUSE ALL THIS ROT MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0036 SAID THE UNIVERSITY MAN IN A GENIAL VOICE WE'VE BEGUN AT THE WRONG END I KNOW BUT WE'LL SOON STRAIGHTEN IT OUT
8838-298545-0037 YOU REMEMBER THE MAN WHOM YOU KNOCKED OUT THIS MORNING HE IS BARTON THE FAMOUS TED BARTON I'M SURE SIR YOU MAY WELL BE PROUD TO HAVE OUTED HIM IN ONE ROUND SAID THE PUBLICAN WHY IT TOOK MORRIS THE TEN STONE SIX CHAMPION
8838-298545-0038 A DEAL MORE TROUBLE THAN THAT BEFORE HE PUT BARTON TO SLEEP YOU'VE DONE A FINE PERFORMANCE SIR AND HAPPEN YOU'LL DO A FINER IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE CHANCE I NEVER HEARD OF TED BARTON BEYOND SEEING THE NAME ON A MEDICINE LABEL SAID THE ASSISTANT WELL
8838-298545-0039 YOU MAY TAKE IT FROM ME THAT HE'S A SLAUGHTERER SAID THE HORSE BREAKER YOU'VE TAUGHT HIM A LESSON THAT HE NEEDED FOR IT WAS ALWAYS A WORD AND A BLOW WITH HIM AND THE WORD ALONE WAS WORTH FIVE SHILLIN IN A PUBLIC COURT HE WON'T BE SO READY NOW TO SHAKE HIS NIEF IN THE FACE OF EVERYONE HE MEETS
8838-298545-0040 HOWEVER THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE MONTGOMERY LOOKED AT THEM IN BEWILDERMENT FOR GOODNESS SAKE GENTLEMEN TELL ME WHAT IT IS YOU WANT ME TO DO HE CRIED WE WANT YOU TO FIGHT SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298545-0041 BUT WHY BECAUSE TED BARTON WAS TO HAVE FOUGHT HIM NEXT SATURDAY HE WAS THE CHAMPION OF THE WILSON COAL PITS AND THE OTHER WAS THE MASTER OF THE IRON FOLK DOWN AT THE CROXLEY SMELTERS WE'D MATCHED OUR MAN FOR A PURSE OF A HUNDRED AGAINST THE MASTER
8838-298545-0042 BUT YOU'VE QUEERED OUR MAN AND HE CAN'T FACE SUCH A BATTLE WITH A TWO INCH CUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE SIR
8838-298545-0043 IF YOU CAN LICK TED BARTON YOU MAY LICK THE MASTER OF CROXLEY BUT IF YOU DON'T WE'RE DONE FOR THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WHO IS IN THE SAME STREET WITH HIM IN THIS DISTRICT IT'S TWENTY ROUNDS TWO OUNCE GLOVES QUEENSBERRY RULES AND A DECISION ON POINTS IF YOU FIGHT TO THE FINISH
8838-298545-0044 FOR A MOMENT THE ABSURDITY OF THE THING DROVE EVERY OTHER THOUGHT OUT OF MONTGOMERY'S HEAD
8838-298545-0045 ALL HE WANTED TO COMPLETE HIS EDUCATION WAS LYING THERE READY TO HIS HAND IF ONLY THAT HAND WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO PICK IT UP HE HAD THOUGHT BITTERLY THAT MORNING THAT THERE WAS NO MARKET FOR HIS STRENGTH
8838-298545-0046 THAN HIS BRAINS IN A YEAR BUT A CHILL OF DOUBT CAME OVER HIM HOW CAN I FIGHT FOR THE COAL PITS SAID HE I AM NOT CONNECTED WITH THEM EH LAD BUT THOU ART CRIED OLD PURVIS WE'VE GOT IT DOWN IN WRITIN AND IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH
8838-298545-0047 IT WOULD BE A VERY SPORTING THING OF YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY IF YOU WOULD COME TO OUR HELP WHEN WE ARE IN SUCH A HOLE OF COURSE YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE TO TAKE THE HUNDRED POUNDS BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IN THE CASE OF YOUR WINNING WE COULD ARRANGE THAT IT SHOULD TAKE THE FORM OF A WATCH OR PIECE OF PLATE
8838-298545-0048 OR ANY OTHER SHAPE WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST ITSELF TO YOU YOU SEE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR HAVING LOST OUR CHAMPION SO WE REALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE A CLAIM UPON YOU GIVE ME A MOMENT GENTLEMEN IT IS VERY UNEXPECTED
8838-298545-0049 I AM AFRAID THE DOCTOR WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO MY GOING IN FACT I AM SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT BUT HE NEED NEVER KNOW NOT BEFORE THE FIGHT AT ANY RATE WE ARE NOT BOUND TO GIVE THE NAME OF OUR MAN SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE WEIGHT LIMITS ON THE DAY OF THE FIGHT THAT IS ALL THAT CONCERNS ANYONE
8838-298545-0050 THOU'LL RISE IN ONE DAY FROM BEING JUST A COMMON DOCTOR TO THE BEST KNOWN MON TWIXT HERE AND BRADFORD THOU ART A WITHERIN TYKE THOU ART AND NO MISTAKE AND IF THOU BEAT THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL THE BEER THOU WANT FOR THE REST OF THY LIFE WAITING FOR THEE AT THE FOUR SACKS
8838-298545-0051 IT IS THE MOST SPORTING THING I EVER HEARD OF IN MY LIFE SAID YOUNG WILSON BY GEORGE SIR IF YOU PULL IT OFF YOU'VE GOT THE CONSTITUENCY IN YOUR POCKET IF YOU CARE TO STAND YOU KNOW THE OUT HOUSE IN MY GARDEN NEXT THE ROAD EXACTLY
8838-298545-0052 THEN YOU'LL WANT A SPARRING PARTNER OGILVY HAS BEEN ACTING FOR BARTON BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT HE IS CLASS ENOUGH BARTON BEARS YOU NO GRUDGE HE'S A GOOD HEARTED FELLOW THOUGH CROSS GRAINED WITH STRANGERS HE LOOKED UPON YOU AS A STRANGER THIS MORNING BUT HE SAYS HE KNOWS YOU NOW
8838-298546-0000 IT WAS TRUE THAT HIS TEACHER WAS LONG PAST HIS PRIME SLOW UPON HIS FEET AND STIFF IN HIS JOINTS BUT EVEN SO HE WAS STILL A TOUGH ANTAGONIST BUT MONTGOMERY HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT HE COULD MORE THAN HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIM HE HAD WON THE UNIVERSITY MEDAL AND HIS TEACHER
8838-298546-0001 IN WHICH HE HAD THE WORST OF IT BUT HAD MADE THE PRIZE FIGHTER STRETCH HIMSELF TO THE UTTERMOST THERE WAS HIS WHOLE RECORD AND WAS IT ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STAND UP TO THE MASTER OF CROXLEY HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE MASTER BEFORE
8838-298546-0002 BUT THEN HE HAD LOST TOUCH OF THE RING DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HARD WORK AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER IF HE WON THERE WAS THE MONEY WHICH MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM IF HE LOST IT WOULD ONLY MEAN A THRASHING HE COULD TAKE PUNISHMENT WITHOUT FLINCHING OF THAT HE WAS CERTAIN
8838-298546-0003 MATCHED AGAINST A PUGILIST OVER AT CROXLEY I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE LAW DOES NOT STEP IN AND STOP SO DEGRADING AN EXHIBITION IT IS REALLY A PRIZE FIGHT A GLOVE FIGHT YOU SAID
8838-298546-0004 I AM INFORMED THAT A TWO OZ GLOVE IS AN EVASION BY WHICH THEY DODGE THE LAW AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE TO INTERFERE
8838-298546-0005 TO THINK THAT SUCH SCENES CAN BE ENACTED WITHIN A FEW MILES OF OUR PEACEFUL HOME BUT YOU WILL REALISE MISTER MONTGOMERY THAT WHILE THERE ARE SUCH INFLUENCES FOR US TO COUNTERACT IT IS VERY NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD LIVE UP TO OUR HIGHEST
8838-298546-0006 THE DOCTOR'S SERMON WOULD HAVE HAD MORE EFFECT IF THE ASSISTANT HAD NOT ONCE OR TWICE HAD OCCASION TO TEST HIS HIGHEST AND COME UPON IT AT UNEXPECTEDLY HUMBLE ELEVATIONS IT IS ALWAYS SO PARTICULARLY EASY TO
8838-298546-0007 COMPOUND FOR SINS WE'RE MOST INCLINED TO BY DAMNING THOSE WE HAVE NO MIND TO IN ANY CASE MONTGOMERY FELT THAT OF ALL THE MEN CONCERNED IN SUCH A FIGHT PROMOTERS BACKERS SPECTATORS IT IS THE ACTUAL FIGHTER
8838-298546-0008 WHO HOLDS THE STRONGEST AND MOST HONOURABLE POSITION HIS CONSCIENCE GAVE HIM NO CONCERN UPON THE SUBJECT ENDURANCE AND COURAGE ARE VIRTUES NOT VICES AND BRUTALITY IS AT LEAST BETTER THAN EFFEMINACY
8838-298546-0009 THE ASSISTANT STROLLED DOWN THERE AFTER TEA AND ASKED IN A CASUAL WAY WHETHER THE TOBACCONIST HAD EVER HEARD OF THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298546-0010 THE LITTLE MAN COULD HARDLY ARTICULATE IN HIS ASTONISHMENT WHY SIR HE'S THE FIRST MON O THE DISTRICT AN HIS NAME'S AS WELL KNOWN IN THE WEST RIDING AS THE WINNER O T DERBY BUT LOR SIR HERE HE STOPPED AND RUMMAGED AMONG A HEAP OF PAPERS
8838-298546-0011 AND SO THE CROXLEY HERALD HAS HIS LIFE AN RECORD AN HERE IT IS AN THOU CANST READ IT FOR THYSEL THE SHEET OF THE PAPER WHICH HE HELD UP WAS A LAKE OF PRINT AROUND AN ISLET OF ILLUSTRATION THE LATTER WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT OF A PUGILIST'S HEAD AND NECK
8838-298546-0012 SILAS CRAGGS AND BENEATH THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL ABOUT HIM THERE SIR SAID THE TOBACCONIST HE'S A WITHERIN TYKE HE IS AND WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE HIM IN THE COUNTY IF HE HADN'T BROKE HIS LEG HE'D HAVE BEEN CHAMPION OF ENGLAND
8838-298546-0013 BROKE HIS LEG HAS HE YES AND IT SET BADLY THEY CA HIM OWD K BEHIND HIS BACK FOR THAT IS HOW HIS TWO LEGS LOOK BUT HIS ARMS WELL IF THEY WAS BOTH STROPPED TO A BENCH AS THE SAYIN IS
8838-298546-0014 I'LL TAKE THIS WITH ME SAID MONTGOMERY AND PUTTING THE PAPER INTO HIS POCKET HE RETURNED HOME IT WAS NOT A CHEERING RECORD WHICH HE READ THERE THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE CROXLEY MASTER WAS GIVEN IN FULL HIS MANY VICTORIES HIS FEW DEFEATS
8838-298546-0015 BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN SAID THE PROVINCIAL BIOGRAPHER SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN IN SPORTING CIRCLES AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY IS NOW IN HIS FORTIETH YEAR HANG IT I'M ONLY TWENTY THREE
8838-298546-0016 AND WON THE PROUD TITLE WHICH HE STILL HOLDS AMBITIOUS OF A MORE THAN LOCAL FAME HE SECURED A PATRON AND FOUGHT HIS FIRST FIGHT AGAINST JACK BARTON OF BIRMINGHAM IN MAY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AT THE OLD LOITERERS CLUB CRAGGS
8838-298546-0017 WHO FOUGHT AT TEN STONE TWO AT THE TIME HAD THE BETTER OF FIFTEEN RATTLING ROUNDS AND GAINED AN AWARD ON POINTS AGAINST THE MIDLANDER HAVING DISPOSED OF JAMES DUNN OF ROTHERHITHE CAMERON OF GLASGOW AND A YOUTH NAMED FERNIE
8838-298546-0018 IT WAS OWING TO THIS THAT HE WAS DEFEATED IN SEVEN ROUNDS BY WILLOX THE MAN WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEATEN AND AFTERWARDS BY JAMES SHAW OF LONDON THOUGH THE LATTER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD FOUND THE TOUGHEST CUSTOMER OF HIS CAREER UNDISMAYED BY HIS REVERSES
8838-298546-0019 THE MASTER ADAPTED THE STYLE OF HIS FIGHTING TO HIS PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND RESUMED HIS CAREER OF VICTORY DEFEATING NORTON THE BLACK HOBBY WILSON AND LEVI COHEN THE LATTER A HEAVY WEIGHT CONCEDING TWO STONE HE FOUGHT A DRAW WITH THE FAMOUS BILLY MC QUIRE
8838-298546-0020 WHO MAY WISH TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BAR ROOM SCRAMBLE AND A SCIENTIFIC CONTEST THE LATEST OF THESE AMBITIOUS SOULS COMES FROM THE WILSON COAL PITS WHICH HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO PUT UP A STAKE OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS AND BACK THEIR LOCAL CHAMPION
8838-298546-0021 THERE ARE VARIOUS RUMOURS AFLOAT AS TO WHO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS TO BE THE NAME OF TED BARTON BEING FREELY MENTIONED BUT THE BETTING WHICH IS SEVEN TO ONE ON THE MASTER AGAINST ANY UNTRIED MAN IS A FAIR REFLECTION OF THE FEELING OF THE COMMUNITY
8838-298546-0022 NO LIGHT MATTER THIS WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN NO BATTLE WITH A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHTER WHO PRESUMED UPON A LOCAL REPUTATION THE MAN'S RECORD SHOWED THAT HE WAS FIRST CLASS OR NEARLY SO THERE WERE A FEW POINTS IN HIS FAVOUR AND HE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEM
8838-298546-0023 THERE WAS AGE TWENTY THREE AGAINST FORTY THERE WAS AN OLD RING PROVERB THAT YOUTH WILL BE SERVED BUT THE ANNALS OF THE RING OFFER A GREAT NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS A HARD VETERAN FULL OF COOL VALOUR AND RING CRAFT
8838-298546-0024 COULD GIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND A BEATING TO MOST STRIPLINGS HE COULD NOT RELY TOO MUCH UPON HIS ADVANTAGE IN AGE BUT THEN THERE WAS THE LAMENESS THAT MUST SURELY COUNT FOR A GREAT DEAL AND LASTLY THERE WAS THE CHANCE THAT THE MASTER MIGHT UNDERRATE HIS OPPONENT
8838-298546-0025 THAT HE MIGHT BE REMISS IN HIS TRAINING AND REFUSE TO ABANDON HIS USUAL WAY OF LIFE IF HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD AN EASY TASK BEFORE HIM IN A MAN OF HIS AGE AND HABITS THIS SEEMED VERY POSSIBLE MONTGOMERY PRAYED THAT IT MIGHT BE SO
8838-298546-0026 MEANWHILE IF HIS OPPONENT WERE THE BEST MAN WHO EVER JUMPED THE ROPES INTO A RING HIS OWN DUTY WAS CLEAR HE MUST PREPARE HIMSELF CAREFULLY THROW AWAY NO CHANCE AND DO THE VERY BEST THAT HE COULD BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE WHICH EXISTS IN BOXING AS IN EVERY SPORT
8838-298546-0027 BETWEEN THE AMATEUR AND THE PROFESSIONAL THE COOLNESS THE POWER OF HITTING ABOVE ALL THE CAPABILITY OF TAKING PUNISHMENT COUNT FOR SO MUCH THOSE SPECIALLY DEVELOPED GUTTA PERCHA LIKE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES OF THE HARDENED PUGILIST
8838-298546-0028 WILL TAKE WITHOUT FLINCHING A BLOW WHICH WOULD LEAVE ANOTHER MAN WRITHING ON THE GROUND SUCH THINGS ARE NOT TO BE ACQUIRED IN A WEEK BUT ALL THAT COULD BE DONE IN A WEEK SHOULD BE DONE THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT HAD A GOOD BASIS TO START FROM
8838-298546-0029 TALL ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ON TWO LEGS AS THE OLD RING MEN USED TO SAY LITHE AND SPARE WITH THE ACTIVITY OF A PANTHER AND A STRENGTH WHICH HAD HARDLY YET EVER FOUND ITS LIMITATIONS HIS MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT WAS FINELY HARD
8838-298546-0030 BUT AS THE VISITING WAS DONE ON FOOT AND CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES HAD TO BE TRAVERSED IT WAS A TRAINING IN ITSELF FOR THE REST HE PUNCHED THE SWINGING BALL AND WORKED WITH THE DUMB BELLS FOR AN HOUR EVERY MORNING AND EVENING AND BOXED TWICE A DAY WITH TED BARTON IN THE GYMNASIUM
8838-298546-0031 GAINING AS MUCH PROFIT AS COULD BE GOT FROM A RUSHING TWO HANDED SLOGGER BARTON WAS FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS CLEVERNESS AND QUICKNESS BUT DOUBTFUL ABOUT HIS STRENGTH HARD HITTING WAS THE FEATURE OF HIS OWN STYLE AND HE EXACTED IT FROM OTHERS
8838-298546-0032 ALL THOT'S BETTER MON THOT'S FINE HE WOULD ADD AS HIS OPPONENT LIFTED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM ON THE END OF A RIGHT COUNTER THOT'S HOW I LIKES TO FEEL EM HAPPEN THOU'LT PULL THROUGH YET HE CHUCKLED WITH JOY WHEN MONTGOMERY KNOCKED HIM INTO A CORNER
8838-298546-0033 THESE CAUSELESS WHIMS AND FANCIES ARE VERY MUCH TO BE DEPRECATED MISTER MONTGOMERY CONSIDER HOW MANY THERE ARE TO WHOM THESE VERY POTATOES AND THIS VERY BEER WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE NO DOUBT SIR BUT AT PRESENT I PREFER TO DO WITHOUT THEM
8838-298546-0034 I SHOULD DO A DOUBLE DAY'S WORK ON FRIDAY SO AS TO LEAVE EVERYTHING IN ORDER I SHOULD HOPE TO BE BACK IN THE EVENING I AM AFRAID I CANNOT SPARE YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY THIS WAS A FACER IF HE COULD NOT GET LEAVE HE WOULD GO WITHOUT IT
8838-298546-0035 YOU WILL REMEMBER DOCTOR OLDACRE THAT WHEN I CAME TO YOU IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT I SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR DAY EVERY MONTH I HAVE NEVER CLAIMED ONE BUT NOW THERE ARE REASONS WHY I WISH TO HAVE A HOLIDAY UPON SATURDAY DOCTOR OLDACRE GAVE IN WITH A VERY BAD GRACE
8838-298546-0036 OF COURSE IF YOU INSIST UPON YOUR FORMAL RIGHTS THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID MISTER MONTGOMERY THOUGH I FEEL THAT IT SHOWS A CERTAIN INDIFFERENCE TO MY COMFORT AND THE WELFARE OF THE PRACTICE DO YOU STILL INSIST YES SIR VERY GOOD HAVE YOUR WAY
8838-298546-0037 A QUIET RESOLUTION IN HIS VOICE AS HE CLAIMED HIS SATURDAY WHICH AROUSED HIS CURIOSITY I HAVE NO DESIRE TO INTERFERE UNDULY WITH YOUR AFFAIRS MISTER MONTGOMERY BUT WERE YOU THINKING OF HAVING A DAY IN LEEDS UPON SATURDAY NO SIR
8838-298546-0038 IN THE COUNTRY YES SIR YOU ARE VERY WISE YOU WILL FIND A QUIET DAY AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS A VERY VALUABLE RESTORATIVE HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION I AM GOING OVER CROXLEY WAY
8838-298546-0039 A VERY INTERESTING RELIC OF THE EARLY NORMAN ERA BY THE WAY THERE IS ONE OBJECTION WHICH I SEE TO YOUR GOING TO CROXLEY ON SATURDAY IT IS UPON THAT DATE AS I AM INFORMED THAT THAT RUFFIANLY GLOVE FIGHT TAKES PLACE
8838-298546-0040 YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF MOLESTED BY THE BLACKGUARDS WHOM IT WILL ATTRACT I WILL TAKE MY CHANCE OF THAT SIR SAID THE ASSISTANT ON THE FRIDAY NIGHT WHICH WAS THE LAST NIGHT BEFORE THE FIGHT
8838-298546-0041 HE'S SIMPLY RIPPING SAID THE UNDERGRADUATE
8838-298546-0042 THAT'S ONLY THREE PUND OFF IN A WEEK'S TRAININ SAID THE HORSE BREAKER HE SAID RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS IN CONDITION WELL IT'S FINE STUFF ALL THERE IS OF IT BUT I'M NONE SO SURE AS THERE IS ENOUGH
8838-298546-0043 HE KEPT POKING HIS FINGER INTO MONTGOMERY AS IF HE WERE ONE OF HIS HORSES I HEAR THAT THE MASTER WILL SCALE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ODD AT THE RING SIDE BUT THERE'S SOME OF THAT WHICH HE'D LIKE WELL TO PULL OFF AND LEAVE BEHIND WI HIS SHIRT SAID PURVIS
8838-298546-0044 I HEAR THEY'VE HAD A RARE JOB TO GET HIM TO DROP HIS BEER AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT GREAT RED HEADED WENCH OF HIS
8838-298546-0045 SHE FAIR SCRATTED THE FACE OFF A POTMAN THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM A GALLON FROM T CHEQUERS THEY SAY THE HUSSY IS HIS SPARRIN PARTNER AS WELL AS HIS SWEETHEART AND THAT HIS POOR WIFE IS JUST BREAKIN HER HEART OVER IT HULLO YOUNG UN WHAT DO YOU WANT
8838-298546-0046 THE DOOR OF THE GYMNASIUM HAD OPENED AND A LAD ABOUT SIXTEEN GRIMY AND BLACK WITH SOOT AND IRON STEPPED INTO THE YELLOW GLARE OF THE OIL LAMP TED BARTON SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR
