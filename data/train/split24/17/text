6272-70168-0000 INSTEAD OF MY HEART LEAPING FOR JOY AS I HAD EXPECTED A SUDDEN INDIFFERENCE FILLED IT I FELT AVERSE TO THE CHANGE FROM THE NARROW WAYS OF BARMOUTH WHICH FOR THE MOMENT I REGRETTED
6272-70168-0001 WHEN I ENTERED THE HOUSE AND SAW MOTHER IN HER OLD PLACE HER SURROUNDINGS UNALTERED I SUFFERED A DISAPPOINTMENT I HAD NOT HAD THE POWER OF TRANSFERRING THE ATMOSPHERE OF MY YEAR'S MISERY TO SURREY
6272-70168-0002 I HEARD THE WONTED SOUND OF THE BANGING OF DOORS THE DOORS AT GRAND'THER'S I MUSED HAD LIST NAILED ROUND THEIR EDGES BUT THEN HE HAD THE LIST BEING A TAILOR I VUM SAID TEMPERANCE WITH HER HAND ON HER HIP
6272-70168-0003 AND NOT OFFERING TO APPROACH ME YOUR HAIR IS AS THICK AS A MOP HEPSEY RUBBING HER FINGERS AGAINST HER THUMB REMARKED THAT SHE HOPED LEARNING HAD NOT TAKEN AWAY MY APPETITE
6272-70168-0004 IS IT BEST TO COOK MORE MISSUS MORGESON
6272-70168-0005 THE BOY BY NAME CHARLES CAME TO SEE THE NEW ARRIVAL BUT SMITTEN WITH DIFFIDENCE CREPT UNDER THE TABLE AND EXAMINED ME FROM HIS RETREAT
6272-70168-0006 INQUIRED MOTHER HE IS GETTING HIS DOUBLE TEETH OH YES AND WHERE'S VERONICA SHE'S UP GARRET WRITING GEOGRAPHY AND TOLD ME NOTHING IN THE WORLD MUST DISTURB HER TILL SHE HAD FINISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE CITY OF PALMIRY
6272-70168-0007 SAID TEMPERANCE CALL HER WHEN SUPPER IS READY REPLIED MOTHER WHO ASKED ME TO COME INTO THE BEDROOM WHERE ARTHUR WAS SLEEPING HE WAS A HANDSOME CHILD LARGE AND FAIR AND AS I LIFTED HIS WHITE LAX FINGERS
6272-70168-0008 A TORRENT OF LOVE SWEPT THROUGH ME AND I KISSED HIM I AM AFRAID I MAKE AN IDOL OF HIM CASSY ARE YOU UNHAPPY BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM SO WELL MOTHER AND FEEL THAT YOU MUST MAKE EXPIATION CASSANDRA SHE SPOKE WITH HASTE
6272-70168-0009 DID YOU EXPERIENCE ANY SHADOW OF A CHANGE DURING THE REVIVAL AT BARMOUTH NO MORE THAN THE BABY HERE DID I SHALL HAVE FAITH THOUGH
6272-70168-0010 BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD THE BLESSING OF SO GOOD A MAN AS YOUR GRAND'THER BUT I NEVER HEARD A WORD OF GRAND'THER'S PRAYERS DO YOU REMEMBER HIS VOICE
6272-70168-0011 MY HEARING HIM OR NOT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE SINCE GOD COULD HEAR AND ANSWER GRAND'THER DOES NOT LIKE ME I NEVER PLEASED HIM SHE LOOKED ASTONISHED THEN REFLECTIVE
6272-70168-0012 TEMPERANCE BROUGHT ARTHUR TO THE TABLE HALF ASLEEP BUT HE ROUSED WHEN SHE DRUMMED ON HIS PLATE WITH A SPOON HEPSEY WAS STATIONED BY THE BANNOCK KNIFE IN HAND TO SERVE IT AS WE BEGAN OUR MEAL
6272-70168-0013 VERONICA CAME IN FROM THE KITCHEN WITH A PLATE OF TOASTED CRACKERS SHE SET THE PLATE DOWN AND GRAVELY SHOOK HANDS WITH ME SAYING SHE HAD CONCLUDED TO LIVE ENTIRELY ON TOAST BUT SUPPOSED I WOULD EAT ALL SORTS OF FOOD AS USUAL
6272-70168-0014 HER FACE WAS STILL LONG AND NARROW BUT PRETTIER AND HER LARGE DARK EYES HAD A SLIGHT CAST WHICH GAVE HER FACE AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION DISTANT INDIFFERENT AND SPECULATIVE AS THE EYES WERE
6272-70168-0015 AND ATE IT IN SILENCE THE PLENTY AROUND ME THE EASE AND INDEPENDENCE GAVE ME A DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF COMFORT THE DISHES WERE ODD SOME OF CHINA SOME OF DELF AND WERE CONTINUALLY MOVED OUT OF THEIR PLACES FOR WE HELPED OURSELVES
6272-70168-0016 SHE WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION TO FULFILL HER DUTIES THAT WAY
6272-70168-0017 I GREW BLITHE AS I SAW IT WINKING UNDER THE RAYS OF THE AFTERNOON SUN AND CLAPPING MY HANDS SAID I WAS GLAD TO GET HOME WE LEFT VERONICA AT THE TABLE AND MOTHER RESUMED HER CONVERSATION WITH ME IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
6272-70168-0018 PRESENTLY TEMPERANCE CAME IN WITH CHARLES BRINGING FRESH PLATES AS SOON AS THEY BEGAN THEIR SUPPER VERONICA ASKED TEMPERANCE HOW THE FISH TASTED IS IT SALT MIDDLING HOW IS THE BANNOCK EXCELLENT
6272-70168-0019 THE GLUTTON BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN HERE LONG THEY ARE ALL SO WHEN THEY FIRST COME SHE THEN GAVE HIM A LARGE SLICE OF THE CAKE VERONICA CONTRARY TO HER WONT
6272-70168-0020 I FEEL EVIL STILL YOU KNOW TURNING TO ME THAT MY TEMPER IS WORSE THAN EVER IT IS LIKE A TIGER'S OH VERRY SAID MOTHER NOT QUITE SO BAD YOU ARE TOO HARD UPON YOURSELF
6272-70168-0021 SAY SO TO MY OWN CHILD VERRY TURNED HER FACE TO THE WALL AND SAID NO MORE BUT SHE HAD STARTED A LESS PLEASANT TRAIN OF THOUGHT IT WAS CHANGED AGAIN BY TEMPERANCE COMING WITH LIGHTS
6272-70168-0022 THOUGH THE TALL BRASS LAMPS GLITTERED LIKE GOLD THEIR CIRCLE OF LIGHT WAS SMALL THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM WERE OBSCURE MISTER PARK ENTERING RETREATED INTO ONE AND MOTHER WAS OBLIGED TO FOREGO THE PLEASURE OF UNDRESSING ARTHUR
6272-70168-0023 SO SHE SENT HIM OFF WITH TEMPERANCE AND CHARLES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO ROCK THE CRADLE AS LONG AS HIS BABYSHIP REQUIRED SOON AFTER FATHER CAME AND HEPSEY BROUGHT IN HIS HOT SUPPER WHILE HE WAS EATING IT GRANDFATHER JOHN MORGESON BUSTLED IN
6272-70168-0024 AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME I SAW THAT HIS HAIR HAD WHITENED HE HELD A TASSELED CANE BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND THUMPED THE FLOOR WHENEVER HE ASKED A QUESTION
6272-70168-0025 AND MOTHER LISTENED WITH A VAGUE RESPECTFUL ATTENTION HER HAND WAS PRESSED AGAINST HER BREAST AS IF SHE WERE REPRESSING AN INWARD VOICE WHICH CLAIMED HER ATTENTION
6272-70168-0026 HER HAIR DROPPED ON HER SHOULDER AND LOOKED LIKE A BROWN COILED SERPENT VERONICA WHO HAD BEEN SILENTLY OBSERVING HER ROSE FROM THE SOFA PICKED UP THE COMB AND FASTENED HER HAIR WITHOUT SPEAKING AS SHE PASSED SHE GAVE ME A DARK LOOK
6272-70168-0027 EH VERRY SAID FATHER ARE YOU THERE WERE YOU GLAD TO SEE CASSY HOME AGAIN SHOULD I BE GLAD WHAT CAN SHE DO GRANDFATHER PURSED UP HIS MOUTH
6272-70168-0028 AND TURNED TOWARD MOTHER AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOU UNDERSTAND BRINGING UP CHILDREN DON'T YOU SHE COMPREHENDED HIM AND GIVING HER HEAD A SLIGHT TOSS TOLD VERRY TO GO AND PLAY ON THE PIANO I WAS GOING SHE ANSWERED PETTISHLY
6272-70168-0029 AND DARTING OUT A MOMENT AFTER WE HEARD HER GRANDFATHER WENT AND PRESENTLY MISTER PARK GOT UP IN A LINGERING WAY
6272-70168-0030 JOE BACON MOTHER RETIRED VERRY STILL PLAYED HER TALENT IS WONDERFUL SAID FATHER TAKING THE CIGAR FROM HIS MOUTH BY THE WAY YOU MUST TAKE LESSONS IN MILFORD I WISH YOU WOULD LEARN TO SING
6272-70168-0031 THOUGH THE FIRE HAD GONE OUT THE LAMPS WINKED BRIGHTLY AND FATHER MOVING HIS CIGAR TO THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS MOUTH CHANGED HIS REGARDS FROM ONE LAMP TO THE OTHER AND SAID HE THOUGHT I WAS GROWING TO BE AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL
6272-70168-0032 A VERY STRONG RELATION OF RESERVE GENERALLY EXISTED BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD INSTEAD OF A CONFIDENTIAL ONE AND THE CHILD WAS APT TO DISCOVER THAT RESERVE ON THE PART OF THE PARENT WAS NOT SUPERIORITY BUT COWARDICE OR INDIFFERENCE
6272-70168-0033 LET IT NOT BE SO WITH US WAS HIS CONCLUSION HE THREW AWAY THE STUMP OF HIS CIGAR AND WENT TO FASTEN THE HALL DOOR I TOOK ONE OF THE BRASS LAMPS PROPOSING TO GO TO BED
6272-70168-0034 AS I PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER ENTRY VERONICA OPENED HER DOOR SHE WAS UNDRESSED AND HAD A LITTLE BOOK IN HER HAND WHICH SHE SHOOK AT ME SAYING
6272-70171-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN IT WAS SUNSET WHEN WE ARRIVED IN ROSVILLE AND FOUND MISTER MORGESON WAITING FOR US WITH HIS CARRIAGE AT THE STATION FROM ITS OPEN SIDES
6272-70171-0001 I LOOKED OUT ON A TRANQUIL AGREEABLE LANDSCAPE THERE WAS NOTHING SALINE IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE WESTERN BREEZE WHICH BLEW IN OUR FACES HAD AN EARTHY SCENT WITH FLUCTUATING STREAMS OF ODORS FROM TREES AND FLOWERS
6272-70171-0002 AS WE PASSED THROUGH THE TOWN COUSIN CHARLES POINTED TO THE ACADEMY WHICH STOOD AT THE HEAD OF A GREEN PRETTY HOUSES STOOD ROUND IT AND STREETS BRANCHED FROM IT IN ALL DIRECTIONS FLOWER GARDENS SHRUBBERY AND TREES WERE SCATTERED EVERYWHERE
6272-70171-0003 ROSVILLE WAS LARGER AND HANDSOMER THAN SURREY THAT IS MY HOUSE ON THE RIGHT HE SAID WE LOOKED DOWN THE SHADY STREET THROUGH WHICH WE WERE GOING
6272-70171-0004 AND PEAKED ROOF AND ON THE SIDE TOWARD US A LARGE YARD AND STABLES WE DROVE INTO THE YARD AND A WOMAN CAME OUT ON THE PIAZZA TO RECEIVE US IT WAS MISSUS MORGESON OR MY WIFE COUSIN ALICE
6272-70171-0005 AS MISTER MORGESON INTRODUCED HER GIVING US A CORDIAL WELCOME SHE LED US INTO A PARLOR WHERE TEA WAS WAITING A SERVANT CAME IN FOR OUR BONNETS AND BASKETS COUSIN ALICE BEGGED US TO TAKE TEA AT ONCE
6272-70171-0006 WE WERE HARDLY SEATED WHEN WE HEARD THE CRY OF A YOUNG CHILD SHE LEFT THE TABLE HASTILY TO COME BACK IN A MOMENT WITH AN APOLOGY WHICH SHE MADE TO COUSIN CHARLES RATHER THAN TO US I HAD NEVER SEEN A TABLE SO WELL ARRANGED
6272-70171-0007 SO FASTIDIOUSLY NEAT IT GLITTERED WITH GLASS AND FRENCH CHINA COUSIN CHARLES SENT AWAY A GLASS AND A PLATE FROWNING AT THE GIRL WHO WAITED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECK OR A FLAW IN THEM THE VIANDS WERE AS PRETTY AS THE DISHES
6272-70171-0008 THE LAMB CHOPS WERE FRAGILE THE BREAD WAS DELICIOUS BUT CUT IN TRANSPARENT SLICES AND THE BUTTER PAT WAS NEARLY STAMPED THROUGH WITH ITS BOUQUET OF FLOWERS THIS WAS ALL THE FEAST EXCEPT SPONGE CAKE WHICH FELT LIKE MUSLIN IN THE FINGERS
6272-70171-0009 I COULD HAVE SQUEEZED THE WHOLE OF IT INTO MY MOUTH STILL HUNGRY I OBSERVED THAT COUSIN CHARLES AND ALICE HAD FINISHED AND THOUGH SHE SHOOK HER SPOON IN THE CUP FEIGNING TO CONTINUE AND HE SNIPPED CRUMBS IN HIS PLATE
6272-70171-0010 I FELT CONSTRAINED TO END MY REPAST HE ROSE THEN AND PUSHING BACK FOLDING DOORS WE ENTERED A LARGE ROOM LEAVING ALICE AT THE TABLE WINDOWS EXTENDING TO THE FLOOR OPENING ON THE PIAZZA
6272-70171-0011 BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE STREAM OF LIGHT OVER THE CARPET I THOUGHT IT SOMBER AND OUT OF KEEPING WITH THE COTTAGE EXTERIOR
6272-70171-0012 THE FURNITURE WAS DARK THE MANTEL AND TABLE TOPS WERE BLACK MARBLE AND THE VASES AND CANDELABRA WERE BRONZE HE DIRECTED MOTHER'S ATTENTION TO THE PORTRAITS OF HIS CHILDREN EXPLAINING THEM
6272-70171-0013 DARK AND DELICATE BUT TO LOOK AT IT MADE ME SHIVER MOTHER CAME TOWARD US PLEADING FATIGUE AS AN EXCUSE FOR RETIRING AND COUSIN CHARLES CALLED COUSIN ALICE WHO WENT WITH US TO OUR ROOM IN THE MORNING SHE SAID
6272-70171-0014 WE SHOULD SEE HER THREE CHILDREN SHE NEVER LEFT THEM SHE WAS SO AFRAID OF THEIR BEING ILL ALSO TELLING MOTHER THAT SHE WOULD DO ALL IN HER POWER TO MAKE MY STAY IN ROSVILLE PLEASANT AND PROFITABLE AS A MOTHER
6272-70171-0015 SHE COULD APPRECIATE HER ANXIETY AND SADNESS IN LEAVING ME MOTHER THANKED HER WARMLY AND WAS SURE THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY BUT I HAD AN INWARD MISGIVING THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT I HEAR EDWARD SAID ALICE GOOD NIGHT
6272-70171-0016 PRESENTLY A GIRL THE SAME WHO HAD TAKEN OUR BONNETS CAME IN WITH A PITCHER OF WARM WATER AND A PLATE OF SODA BISCUIT SHE DIRECTED US WHERE TO FIND THE APPAREL SHE HAD NICELY SMOOTHED AND FOLDED TOOK OFF THE HANDSOME COUNTERPANE AND THE PILLOWS TRIMMED WITH LACE
6272-70171-0017 PUTTING OTHERS OF A PLAINER MAKE IN THEIR PLACES SHOOK DOWN THE WINDOW CURTAINS ASKED US IF WE WOULD HAVE ANYTHING MORE AND QUIETLY DISAPPEARED I OFFERED MOTHER THE WARM WATER AND APPROPRIATED THE BISCUITS THERE WERE SIX I ATE EVERY ONE
6272-70171-0018 UNDRESSING MEANWHILE AND SURVEYING THE APARTMENT CASSY MISSUS MORGESON IS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER YES I SAID HUSKILY FOR THE DRY BISCUIT CHOKED ME WHAT WOULD TEMPERANCE AND HEPSEY SAY TO THIS
6272-70171-0019 I THINK THEY WOULD GRUMBLE AND ADMIRE LOOK AT THIS SHOWING HER THE TASSELS OF THE INNER WINDOW CURTAINS DONE UP IN LITTLE BAGS AND THE GLASS IS PINNED UP WITH NICE YELLOW PAPER
6272-70171-0020 AND HERE IS A DAMASK NAPKIN FASTENED TO THE WALL BEHIND THE WASHSTAND AND EVERYTHING STANDS ON A MAT I WONDER IF THIS IS TO BE MY ROOM IT IS PROBABLY THE CHAMBER FOR VISITORS WHY
6272-70171-0021 IT WAS BYRON AND TURNING OVER THE LEAVES TILL I CAME TO DON JUAN I READ IT THROUGH
6272-70171-0022 WHICH WAS NOT THE ONE WE HAD TAKEN TEA IN BUT A SMALL APARTMENT WITH A DOOR OPENING INTO THE GARDEN
6272-70171-0023 AND THEIR MOTHER WAS TENDING AND WATCHING THEM THE OLDEST WAS EIGHT YEARS THE YOUNGEST THREE MONTHS COUSIN ALICE GAVE US DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR TASTES AND HABITS DWELLING WITH EMPHASIS ON THOSE OF THE BABY
6272-70171-0024 I DREW FROM HER CONVERSATION THE OPINION THAT SHE HAD A TENDENCY TO THE REARING OF CHILDREN I WAS GLAD WHEN COUSIN CHARLES CAME IN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH SEND OFF THE BABIES ALICE AND RING THE BELL FOR BREAKFAST SHE SENT OUT THE TWO YOUNGEST
6272-70171-0025 PUT LITTLE EDWARD IN HIS CHAIR AND BREAKFAST BEGAN MISSUS MORGESON SAID CHARLES THE HORSES WILL BE READY TO TAKE YOU ROUND ROSVILLE WE WILL CALL ON DOCTOR PRICE FOR YOU TO SEE THE KIND OF MASTER CASSANDRA WILL HAVE I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT RECEIVING A NEW PUPIL
6272-70171-0026 I SAID MOTHER TRIED IN VAIN TO LOOK HARD HEARTED AND TO PERSUADE THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR ME BUT SHE LOST HER APPETITE WITH THE THOUGHT OF LOSING ME WHICH THE MENTION OF DOCTOR PRICE BROUGHT HOME
6272-70171-0027 THE HAM WAS MOST SAVORY BUT CUT IN SUCH THIN SLICES THAT IT CURLED AND THE BISCUITS WERE AS WHITE AND FEATHERY AS SNOWFLAKES
6272-70171-0028 COUSIN ALICE GAVE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO EDWARD WHO ATE AS LITTLE AS THE REST MOTHER I SAID AFTERWARD
6272-70171-0029 I NOTICED HOW ELEGANT THEIR TABLE APPOINTMENTS WERE AND I SHALL BUY NEW CHINA IN BOSTON TO MORROW I WISH HEPSEY WOULD NOT LOAD OUR TABLE AS SHE DOES HEPSEY IS A GOOD WOMAN MOTHER DO GIVE MY LOVE TO HER NOW THAT I THINK OF IT
6272-70171-0030 SHE WAS ALWAYS MAKING UP SOME NICE DISH TELL HER I REMEMBER IT WILL YOU WHEN COUSIN CHARLES PUT US INTO THE CARRIAGE AND HOISTED LITTLE EDWARD ON THE FRONT SEAT MOTHER NOTICED THAT TWO MEN HELD THE HORSES AND THAT THEY WERE NOT THE SAME HE HAD DRIVEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
6272-70171-0031 SHE SAID SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO THEY LOOKED UNGOVERNABLE BUT HE REASSURED HER AND ONE OF THE MEN AVERRING THAT MISTER MORGESON COULD DRIVE ANYTHING SHE REPRESSED HER FEARS AND WE DROVE OUT OF THE YARD BEHIND A PAIR OF HORSES
6272-70171-0032 THAT STOOD ON THEIR HIND LEGS AS OFTEN AS THAT POSITION WAS COMPATIBLE WITH THE NECESSITY THEY WERE UNDER OF GETTING ON FOR THEY EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY WERE GUIDED BY A FIRM HAND EDWARD WAS DELIGHTED WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR
6272-70171-0033 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIS FATHER SMILE ON HIM THESE ARE FINE BRUTES HE SAID NOT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THEM BUT THEY ARE NOT EQUAL TO MY MARE NELL ALICE IS AFRAID OF HER BUT I HOPE THAT YOU CASSANDRA
6272-70171-0034 LEAPING SO HIGH THAT THE HARNESS SEEMED RATTLING FROM THEIR BACKS HE STRUCK THEM AND SAID GO ON NOW GO ON DEVILS THERE WAS NO FURTHER TROUBLE HE ENCOURAGED MOTHER NOT TO BE AFRAID LOOKING KEENLY AT ME
6272-70171-0035 AND THE SCHOLARS SOME SIXTY BOYS AND GIRLS WERE COMING DOWNSTAIRS FROM THE HALL TO GO INTO THE ROOMS EACH SIDE OF A GREAT DOOR DOCTOR PRICE WAS BEHIND THEM HE STOPPED WHEN HE SAW US AN INTRODUCTION TOOK PLACE AND HE INQUIRED FOR DOCTOR SNELL
6272-70171-0036 AS AN OLD COLLEGE FRIEND LOCKE MORGESON SOUNDED FAMILIARLY HE SAID A MEMBER OF HIS MOTHER'S FAMILY NAMED SOMERS HAD MARRIED A GENTLEMAN OF THAT NAME HE REMEMBERED IT FROM AN OLD IVORY MINIATURE WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SHOWN HIM
6272-70171-0037 TELLING HIM IT WAS THE LIKENESS OF HER COUSIN RACHEL'S HUSBAND I REPLIED WE KNEW THAT GRANDFATHER HAD MARRIED A RACHEL SOMERS COUSIN CHARLES WAS SURPRISED AND A LITTLE VEXED THAT THE DOCTOR HAD NEVER TOLD HIM
6272-70171-0038 AND WE FOLLOWED HIM TO HER SCHOOL ROOM I WAS AT ONCE INTERESTED AND IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF MY TEACHER THAT WAS TO BE SHE WAS A DIGNIFIED KIND LOOKING WOMAN WHO ASKED ME A FEW QUESTIONS IN SUCH A PLEASANT DIRECT MANNER
6272-70171-0039 THAT I FRANKLY TOLD HER I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD VERY IGNORANT AND AVERSE FROM LEARNING BUT I DID NOT SPEAK LOUD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY BESIDE HERSELF TO HEAR NOW SAID MOTHER WHEN WE CAME AWAY
6272-70171-0040 THINK HOW MUCH GREATER YOUR ADVANTAGES ARE THAN MINE HAVE EVER BEEN HOW MISERABLE WAS MY YOUTH IT IS TOO LATE FOR ME TO MAKE ANY ATTEMPT AT CULTIVATION I HAVE NO WISH THAT WAY
6272-70171-0041 AND THAT THERE WAS NO CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH IN ROSVILLE SHE WENT TO BOSTON THAT FRIDAY AFTERNOON ANXIOUS TO GET SAFELY HOME WITH VERONICA WE PARTED WITH MANY A KISS AND SHAKE OF THE HAND AND LAST WORDS
6272-70191-0000 WE SAT IN STATE TO BE CONDOLED WITH AND WAITED UPON
6272-70191-0001 THOUGH I AM SURE THE PERFORMERS THEREOF HAD SMALL ENCOURAGEMENT VERONICA ALONE WOULD SEE NO ONE HER ROOM WAS THE ONLY ONE NOT INVADED FOR THE NEIGHBORS TOOK THE HOUSE INTO THEIR HANDS ASSISTED BY THAT PART OF THE MORGESONS
6272-70191-0002 WHO WERE TOO DISTANTLY RELATED TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES AS MOURNERS TO BE SHUT UP WITH US IT WAS PUT UNDER RIGOROUS FUNERAL LAW AND INSPECTED FROM GARRET TO CELLAR THEY SUPERVISED ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
6272-70191-0003 HER COURSE WAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED MINE WAS IMPOSED UPON ME I REMONSTRATED WITH TEMPERANCE BUT SHE REPLIED THAT IT WAS ALL WELL MEANT AND ALWAYS DONE
6272-70191-0004 I ENDURED THE SAME ANNOYANCES OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM RELAYS OF PEOPLE BED TIME ESPECIALLY WAS THEIR OCCASION I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO UNDRESS ALONE I MUST HAVE DRINKS EITHER TO COMPOSE OR STIMULATE
6272-70191-0005 THEY REITERATED THE CHARACTER THE PECULIARITIES THE VIRTUES OF THE MOTHER I HAD LOST WHO COULD NEVER BE REPLACED WHO WAS IN A BETTER WORLD HOWEVER I WAS IN A MEASURE
6272-70191-0006 KEPT FROM MYSELF DURING THIS INTERVAL THE MATTER IS OFTEN SUBSERVIENT TO THE MANNER ARTHUR'S FEELINGS WERE PLAYED UPON ALSO HE WEPT OFTEN CONFIDING TO ME HIS GRIEF AND HIS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
6272-70191-0007 THINGS WOULD GO WELL HE SAID FOR EVERYBODY MUST EXPECT TO DIE THEN THE BIBLE SAYS SO HE INFORMED ME ALSO THAT HE EXPECTED TO BE AN ARCHITECT AND THAT MOTHER LIKED IT HE HAD AN IDEA
6272-70191-0008 WHICH HE HAD IMPARTED TO HER OF AN ARCH IT MUST BE MADE OF BLACK MARBLE WITH GOLD VEINS AND OUGHT TO STAND IN EGYPT WITH THE WORD PANDEMONIUM ON IT THE KITCHEN WAS THE FOCUS OF INTEREST TO HIM
6272-70191-0009 FOR MEALS WERE PREPARED AT ALL HOURS FOR COMERS AND GOERS TEMPERANCE TOLD ME THAT THE MILD AND INDIFFERENT MOURNERS WERE FOND OF GOOD VICTUALS AND SHE THOUGHT THEIR HEARTS WERE LIGHTER THAN THEIR STOMACHS WHEN THEY WENT AWAY
6272-70191-0010 BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO GRIEF STRUCK AUNT MERCE WAS ENGAGED WITH A DRESSMAKER AND WITH THE ORDERS FOR BONNETS AND VEILS SHE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF THE MOURNING WITH THE MORGESONS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL HER ARRANGEMENTS
6272-70191-0011 FOR SHE DERIVED A SIMPLE COMFORT FROM THESE EXTERNAL TOKENS VERONICA REFUSED TO WEAR THE BONNET AND VEIL AND THE REQUIRED BOMBAZINE BOMBAZINE MADE HER FLESH CRAWL WHY SHOULD SHE WEAR IT MOTHER HATED IT TOO
6272-70191-0012 FOR SHE HAD NEVER WORN OUT THE GARMENTS MADE FOR GRAND'THER WARREN SHE'S A BIGGER CHILD THAN EVER TEMPERANCE REMARKED AND MUST HAVE HER WAY
6272-70191-0013 COMING INTO MY ROOM DRESSED FOR THE FUNERAL NO
6272-70191-0014 THE YARD IS FULL OF CARRIAGES ALREADY SOMEBODY HANDED ME GLOVES MY BONNET WAS TIED A HANDKERCHIEF GIVEN TO ME AND THE DOOR OPENED IN THE PASSAGE I HEARD A KNOCKING FROM VERONICA'S ROOM AND CROSSED TO LEARN WHAT SHE WANTED
6272-70191-0015 IS THIS LIKE HER SHE ASKED SHOWING ME A DRAWING HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE I HAVE TRIED IS IT LIKE YES THE IDEA
6272-70191-0016 BUT WHAT A PICTURE SHE HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE MOTHER'S SHADOWY FACE SERENELY LOOKED FROM A HIGH SMALL WINDOW SET IN CLOUDS LIKE THOSE WHICH GATHER OVER THE SUN WHEN IT DRAWS WATER
6272-70191-0017 IT WAS CLOSELY PRESSED TO THE GLASS AND SHE WAS REGARDING DARK INDEFINITE CREATURES BELOW IT
6272-70191-0018 KEEP IT BUT DON'T WORK ON IT ANY MORE AND I PUT IT AWAY SHE WAS WAN AND LANGUID BUT COLLECTED I SEE YOU ARE READY SOMEBODY MUST BURY THE DEAD GO
6272-70191-0019 WILL THE HOUSE BE EMPTY YES GOOD I CAN WALK THROUGH IT ONCE MORE THE DEAD MUST BE BURIED THAT IS CERTAIN BUT WHY SHOULD IT BE CERTAIN THAT I MUST BE THE ONE TO DO IT YOU THINK I CAN GO THROUGH WITH IT THEN
6272-70191-0020 I HAVE SET YOUR BEHAVIOR DOWN TO YOUR WILL YOU MAY BE RIGHT PERHAPS MOTHER WAS ALWAYS RIGHT ABOUT ME TOO SHE WAS AGAINST ME SHE LOOKED AT ME WITH A TIMIDITY AND APPREHENSION THAT MADE MY HEART BLEED
6272-70191-0021 I THINK WE MIGHT KISS EACH OTHER NOW SHE SAID I OPENED MY ARMS HOLDING HER AGAINST MY BREAST SO TIGHTLY THAT SHE DREW BACK BUT KISSED MY CHEEK GENTLY AND TOOK FROM HER POCKET
6272-70191-0022 A FLACON OF SALTS WHICH SHE FASTENED TO MY BELT BY ITS LITTLE CHAIN AND SAID AGAIN GO BUT RECALLING ME SAID
6272-70191-0023 THE LANDING STAIR WAS FULL OF PEOPLE I LOCKED THE DOOR AND TOOK OUT THE KEY THE STAIRS WERE CROWDED ALL MADE WAY FOR ME WITH A SILENT RESPECT AUNT MERCE WHEN SHE SAW ME
6272-70191-0024 PUT HER HAND ON AN EMPTY CHAIR BESIDE FATHER WHO SAT BY THE COFFIN THOSE PASSAGES IN THE BIBLE WHICH CONTAIN THE BEAUTIFULLY POETIC IMAGES RELATING TO THE GOING OF MAN TO HIS LONG HOME WERE READ AND TO MY EAR
6272-70191-0025 THEY SEEMED TO FALL ON THE COFFIN IN DULL STRIFE WITH ITS INMATE WHO MUTELY CONTRADICTED THEM A DISCOURSE FOLLOWED WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO HARROW THE FEELINGS TO THE UTMOST ARTHUR BEGAN TO CRY SO NERVOUSLY
6272-70191-0026 THAT SOME CONSIDERATE FRIEND TOOK HIM OUT AND AUNT MERCE WEPT SO VIOLENTLY THAT SHE GREW FAINT AND CAUGHT HOLD OF ME I GAVE HER THE FLACON OF SALTS WHICH REVIVED HER BUT I FELT AS FATHER LOOKED STERN
6272-70191-0027 AND ANXIOUS TO ESCAPE THE UNPROFITABLE TRIAL AS THE COFFIN WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE HEARSE MY HEART TWISTED AND PALPITATED AS IF A COMMAND HAD BEEN LAID UPON IT TO FOLLOW AND NOT LEAVE HER
6272-70191-0028 WHEN THE HEARSE MOVED DOWN THE STREET FATHER ARTHUR AND I WERE CALLED AND ASSISTED IN OUR OWN CHAISE AS IF WE WERE HELPLESS THE REINS WERE PUT IN FATHER'S HANDS AND THE HORSE WAS LED BEHIND THE HEARSE
6272-70191-0029 AT LAST THE WORD WAS GIVEN AND THE LONG PROCESSION BEGAN TO MOVE THROUGH THE STREET WHICH WAS DESERTED A CAT RAN OUT OF A HOUSE AND SCAMPERED ACROSS THE WAY ARTHUR LAUGHED AND FATHER JUMPED NERVOUSLY AT THE SOUND OF HIS LAUGH
6272-70191-0030 THE GRAVEYARD WAS A MILE OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE A SANDY PLAIN WHERE A FEW STUNTED PINES TRANSPLANTED FROM THE WOODS NEAR IT STRUGGLED TO KEEP ALIVE AS WE TURNED FROM THE STREET INTO THE LANE WHICH LED TO IT
6272-70191-0031 AND RODE UP A LITTLE HILL WHERE THE SAND WAS SO DEEP THAT IT MUFFLED THE WHEELS AND FEET OF THE HORSES THE WHOLE ROUND OF THE GRAY SKY WAS VISIBLE IT HUNG LOW OVER US I WISHED IT TO DROP AND BLOT OUT THE VAGUE NOTHINGS UNDER IT
6272-70191-0032 WE LEFT THE CARRIAGE AT THE PALINGS AND WALKED UP THE NARROW PATH AMONG THE MOUNDS WHERE EVERY STONE WAS MARKED MORGESON SOME SO OLD THAT THEY WERE STAINED WITH BLOTCHES OF YELLOW MOSS
6272-70191-0033 SLANTING BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN PROTEST AGAINST THE FOLLY OF INDICATING WHAT WAS NO LONGER BENEATH THEM THE MOUNDS WERE COVERED WITH MATS OF SCANTY TANGLED GRASS WITH HERE AND THERE A RANK SPOT OF GREEN
6272-70191-0034 IT WAS THE CUSTOM AND FATHER TOOK HIS HAT OFF TO THANK HIS FRIENDS FOR THEIR SYMPATHY AND ATTENTION HIS LIPS MOVED BUT NO WORDS WERE AUDIBLE THE PROCESSION MOVED DOWN THE PATH AGAIN
6272-70191-0035 ARTHUR'S HAND WAS IN MINE HE STAMPED HIS FEET FIRMLY ON THE SAND AS IF TO BREAK THE OPPRESSIVE SILENCE WHICH NO ONE SEEMED DISPOSED TO DISTURB THE SAME CEREMONIES WERE PERFORMED IN STARTING US HOMEWARD
6272-70191-0036 BUT NOT A SOUL WAS THERE WHEN WE WENT IN THE DUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND TRADITION HAD BEEN FULFILLED THE NEIGHBORS HAD GONE HOME TO THEIR AVOCATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC THE TRAGEDY WAS OVER ALL SPECULATION ON THE DEGREE OF OUR GRIEF
6272-70191-0037 OR OUR INDIFFERENCE WAS SETTLED WE COULD TAKE OFF OUR MOURNING GARMENTS AND OUR MOURNING COUNTENANCE NOW THAT WE WERE ALONE OR WE COULD GIVE WAY TO THAT ANGUISH WE ARE AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO SHOW EXCEPT BEFORE THE ONE
6563-285357-0000 THIS IMPERIAL APPRECIATION OF WHAT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED PROVED TO BE THE TURNING POINT IN THE INVENTOR'S FORTUNES IT STIMULATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THE SECOND AIRSHIP WAS TAKEN IN HAND BUT MISFORTUNE STILL PURSUED HIM
6563-285357-0001 ACCIDENTS WERE OF ALMOST DAILY OCCURRENCE DEFECTS WERE REVEALED HERE AND WEAKNESSES SOMEWHERE ELSE SO SOON AS ONE TROUBLE WAS OVERCOME ANOTHER MADE ITSELF MANIFEST THE RESULT WAS THAT THE WHOLE OF THE MONEY COLLECTED BY HIS HARD WORK
6563-285357-0002 WAS EXPENDED BEFORE THE SHIP COULD TAKE TO THE AIR A FURTHER CRASH AND BLASTING OF CHERISHED HOPES APPEARED IMMINENT BUT AT THIS MOMENT ANOTHER ROYAL PERSONAGE CAME TO THE INVENTOR'S AID THE KING OF WURTEMBERG
6563-285357-0003 TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIS SUBJECT'S UPHILL STRUGGLE AND THE WURTEMBERG GOVERNMENT GRANTED HIM THE PROCEEDS OF A LOTTERY WITH THIS MONEY AND WITH WHAT HE SUCCEEDED IN RAISING BY HOOK AND BY CROOK AND BY MORTGAGING HIS REMAINING PROPERTY
6563-285357-0004 AND IN NINETEEN O FIVE IT WAS LAUNCHED IT WAS A DISTINCT IMPROVEMENT UPON ITS PREDECESSORS THE AIRSHIP WAS FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN FEET IN LENGTH BY THIRTY EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER WAS EQUIPPED WITH SEVENTEEN GAS BALLOONS
6563-285357-0005 HAVING AN AGGREGATE CAPACITY OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND CUBIC FEET OF HYDROGEN WAS EQUIPPED WITH TWO EIGHTY FIVE HORSE POWER MOTORS DRIVING FOUR PROPELLERS AND DISPLACED NINE TONS ALL THE IMPERFECTIONS INCIDENTAL TO THE PREVIOUS CRAFT
6563-285357-0006 HAD BEEN ELIMINATED WHILE THE SHIP FOLLOWED IMPROVED LINES IN ITS MECHANICAL AND STRUCTURAL DETAILS THE TRIALS WITH THIS VESSEL COMMENCED ON NOVEMBER THIRTIETH NINETEEN O FIVE BUT ILL LUCK HAD NOT BEEN ELUDED
6563-285357-0007 THE AIRSHIP WAS MOORED UPON A RAFT WHICH WAS TO BE TOWED OUT INTO THE LAKE TO ENABLE THE DIRIGIBLE TO ASCEND BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH THE ARRANGEMENTS A STRONG WIND CAUGHT THE UNGAINLY AIRSHIP SHE DIPPED HER NOSE INTO THE WATER AND AS THE MOTOR WAS SET GOING
6563-285357-0008 SHE WAS DRIVEN DEEPER INTO THE LAKE THE VESSEL ONLY BEING SAVED BY HURRIED DEFLATION SIX WEEKS WERE OCCUPIED IN REPAIRS BUT ANOTHER ASCENT WAS MADE ON JANUARY SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN O SIX THE TRIALS WERE FAIRLY SATISFACTORY
6563-285357-0009 BUT INCONCLUSIVE ONE OF THE MOTORS WENT WRONG AND THE LONGITUDINAL STABILITY WAS FOUND TO BE INDIFFERENT THE VESSEL WAS BROUGHT DOWN AND WAS TO BE ANCHORED BUT THE FATES RULED OTHERWISE A STRONG WIND CAUGHT HER DURING THE NIGHT
6563-285357-0010 AND SHE WAS SPEEDILY REDUCED TO INDISTINGUISHABLE SCRAP DESPITE CATASTROPHE THE INVENTOR WRESTLED GAMELY WITH HIS PROJECT THE LESSONS TAUGHT BY ONE DISASTER WERE TAKEN TO HEART
6563-285357-0011 AND ARRANGEMENTS TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE THEREOF INCORPORATED IN THE SUCCEEDING CRAFT UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER AS SOON AS ONE DEFECT WAS REMEDIED ANOTHER ASSERTED ITSELF IT WAS THIS PERSISTENT REVELATION OF THE UNEXPECTED
6563-285357-0012 WHICH CAUSED ANOTHER PERIOD OF INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS HIS INVENTION PROBABLY NOTHING MORE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARD OF THE ZEPPELIN AFTER THIS LAST ACCIDENT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTERVENTION OF THE PRUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE DIRECT INSTIGATION OF THE KAISER
6563-285357-0013 WHO HAD NOW TAKEN COUNT ZEPPELIN UNDER HIS WING A STATE LOTTERY WAS INAUGURATED THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WERE HANDED OVER TO THE INDEFATIGABLE INVENTOR TOGETHER WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT IF HE COULD KEEP ALOFT TWENTY FOUR HOURS WITHOUT COMING TO EARTH IN THE MEANTIME
6563-285357-0014 AND COULD COVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILES WITHIN THIS PERIOD THE GOVERNMENT WOULD REPAY THE WHOLE OF THE MONEY HE HAD LAVISHED UPON HIS IDEA AND LIQUIDATE ALL THE DEBTS HE HAD INCURRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH ANOTHER CRAFT WAS BUILT LARGER THAN ITS PREDECESSORS
6563-285357-0015 AND EQUIPPED WITH TWO MOTORS DEVELOPING ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY HORSE POWER UPON COMPLETION IT WAS SUBMITTED TO SEVERAL PRELIMINARY FLIGHTS WHICH WERE SO EMINENTLY SUCCESSFUL THAT THE INVENTOR DECIDED TO MAKE A TRIAL TRIP UNDER CONDITIONS CLOSELY ANALOGOUS
6563-285357-0016 TO THOSE IMPOSED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TEST ON JUNE TWENTIETH NINETEEN O EIGHT AT EIGHT TWENTY SIX A M THE CRAFT ASCENDED AND REMAINED ALOFT FOR TWELVE HOURS DURING WHICH TIME IT MADE AN ENCOURAGING CIRCULAR TOUR FLUSHED WITH THIS SUCCESS
6563-285357-0017 THE COUNT CONSIDERED THAT THE OFFICIAL AWARD WAS WITHIN REACH AND THAT ALL HIS PREVIOUS DISASTERS AND MISFORTUNES WERE ON THE EVE OF REDEMPTION THE CRUCIAL TEST WAS ESSAYED ON AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN O EIGHT ACCOMPANIED BY TWELVE OBSERVERS
6563-285357-0018 THE VESSEL ASCENDED AND TRAVELLED WITHOUT INCIDENT FOR EIGHT HOURS THEN A SLIGHT MISHAP DEMANDED ATTENTION BUT WAS SPEEDILY REPAIRED AND WAS IGNORED OFFICIALLY AS BEING TOO TRIVIAL TO INFLUENCE THE MAIN ISSUE VICTORY APPEARED WITHIN
6563-285357-0019 MEASURABLE DISTANCE THE ARDUOUS TOIL OF MANY PATIENT YEARS WAS ABOUT TO BE REWARDED THE AIRSHIP WAS WITHIN SIGHT OF HOME WHEN IT HAD TO DESCEND OWING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANOTHER MOTOR FAULT BUT AS IT APPROACHED THE GROUND NATURE
6563-285357-0020 AS IF INFURIATED AT THE CONQUEST ROSE UP IN REBELLION A SUDDEN SQUALL STRUCK THE UNWIELDY MONSTER WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS IT BECAME UNMANAGEABLE AND THROUGH SOME INSCRUTABLE CAUSE IT CAUGHT FIRE WITH THE RESULT THAT WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS
6563-285357-0021 IT WAS REDUCED TO A TANGLED MASS OF METALLIC FRAMEWORK IT WAS A CATASTROPHE THAT WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY VANQUISHED MANY AN INVENTOR BUT THE COUNT WAS SAVED THE GALL OF DEFEAT HIS FLIGHT WHICH WAS REMARKABLE INASMUCH AS HE HAD COVERED THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES
6563-285357-0022 WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS INCLUDING TWO UNAVOIDABLE DESCENTS STRUCK THE TEUTON IMAGINATION THE SEEDS SO CAREFULLY PLANTED BY THE MOST HIGH OF PRUSSIA NOW BORE FRUIT THE GERMAN NATION SYMPATHISED WITH THE INDOMITABLE INVENTOR
6563-285357-0023 APPRECIATED HIS GENIUS AND PROMPTLY POURED FORTH A STREAM OF SUBSCRIPTIONS TO ENABLE HIM TO BUILD ANOTHER VESSEL THE INTIMATION THAT OTHER POWERS HAD APPROACHED THE COUNT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF HIS IDEA BECAME KNOWN FAR AND WIDE
6563-285357-0024 TOGETHER WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE HAD UNEQUIVOCALLY REFUSED ALL OFFERS HE WAS STRIVING FOR THE FATHERLAND
6563-285357-0025 HE COULD FORGE AHEAD UNTRAMMELLED BY ANXIETY AND WORRY ANOTHER ZEPPELIN WAS BUILT AND IT CREATED A WORLD'S RECORD IT REMAINED ALOFT FOR THIRTY EIGHT HOURS DURING WHICH TIME IT COVERED SIX HUNDRED NINETY MILES AND ALTHOUGH IT CAME TO GRIEF UPON ALIGHTING
6563-285357-0026 BY COLLIDING WITH A TREE THE FINAL INCIDENT PASSED UNNOTICED
6563-285357-0027 IT HAD AN AIRSHIP WHICH COULD GO ANYWHERE IRRESPECTIVE OF CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND IN TRUE TEUTON PERSPECTIVE THE CRAFT WAS VIEWED FROM THE MILITARY STANDPOINT HERE WAS A MEANS OF OBTAINING THE MASTERY OF THE AIR
6563-285357-0028 A FORMIDABLE ENGINE OF INVASION AND AERIAL ATTACK HAD BEEN PERFECTED CONSEQUENTLY THE GRAND IDEA MUST BE SUPPORTED WITH UNBOUNDED ENTHUSIASM THE COUNT WAS HAILED BY HIS AUGUST MASTER AS THE GREATEST GERMAN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
6563-285357-0029 AND IN THIS APPRECIATION THE POPULACE WHOLEHEARTEDLY CONCURRED WHETHER SUCH A PANEGYRIC FROM SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS QUARTER IS PRAISE INDEED OR THE EQUIVALENT OF COMPLETE CONDEMNATION HISTORY ALONE WILL BE ABLE TO JUDGE
6563-285357-0030 BUT WHEN ONE REFLECTS AT THIS MOMENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS AIRCRAFT DURING THE PRESENT CONFLAGRATION THE UNPREJUDICED WILL BE RATHER INCLINED TO HAZARD THE OPINION THAT IMPERIAL TEUTON PRAISE IS A SYNONYM FOR DAMNATION
6563-285357-0031 ALTHOUGH THE ZEPPELIN WAS ACCEPTED AS A PERFECT MACHINE IT HAS NEVER BEEN POSSIBLE TO DISPERSE THE ATMOSPHERE OF DISASTER WITH WHICH IT HAS BEEN ENVELOPED FROM THE FIRST VESSEL AFTER VESSEL HAS GONE UP IN SMOKE AND FLAME FEW CRAFT OF THIS TYPE
6563-285357-0032 HAVE ENJOYED MORE THAN AN EVANESCENT EXISTENCE
6563-285357-0033 THAN ITS PREDECESSOR BUT THE TEUTONIC NATION HAS BEEN INDUCED TO PIN ITS WHOLE FAITH ON THIS AIRSHIP NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE MORE LEVELHEADED ENGINEERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THE CRAFT TO BE A MECHANICAL MONSTROSITY CONDEMNED FROM ITS DESIGN
6563-285357-0034 AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSTRUCTION TO DISASTER UNSHAKEN BY THIS ADVERSE CRITICISM GERMANY RESTS ASSURED THAT BY MEANS OF ITS ZEPPELINS IT WILL ACHIEVE THAT UNIVERSAL SUPREMACY WHICH IT IS CONVINCED IS ITS DESTINY
6563-285357-0035 THIS BLIND CHILD LIKE FAITH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ZEPPELIN FACTORIES AT FRIEDRICHSHAFEN THE FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO PRODUCE TWO OF THESE VESSELS PER MONTH WHILE ANOTHER FACTORY OF A SIMILAR CAPACITY
6563-285357-0036 HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT BERLIN UNFORTUNATELY SUCH BIG CRAFT DEMAND LARGE DOCKS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM AND IN TURN A LARGE STRUCTURE OF THIS CHARACTER CONSTITUTES AN EASY MARK FOR HOSTILE ATTACK AS THE RAIDING AIRMEN OF THE ALLIES HAVE
6563-285357-0037 PROVED VERY CONVINCINGLY BUT THE ZEPPELIN MUST NOT BE UNDER RATED MAGNIFICENT PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN RECORDED BY THESE VESSELS SUCH AS THE ROUND ONE THOUSAND MILES TRIP IN NINETEEN O NINE AND SEVERAL OTHER
6563-285357-0038 EQUALLY BRILLIANT FEATS SINCE THAT DATE IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT EACH ASTOUNDING ACHIEVEMENT HAS BEEN ATTENDED BY AN EQUALLY STUPENDOUS ACCIDENT BUT THAT IS ACCEPTED AS A MERE INCIDENTAL DETAIL BY THE FAITHFUL TEUTONIC NATION
6563-285357-0039 MANY VIVID PROPHECIES OF THE FORTHCOMING FLIGHTS BY ZEPPELIN HAVE BEEN UTTERED AND IT IS QUITE PROBABLE THAT MORE THAN ONE WILL BE FULFILLED BUT SUCCESS WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE RATHER TO ACCIDENT THAN DESIGN
6563-285357-0040 ALTHOUGH THE ZEPPELIN IS THE MAIN STAKE OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE IN MATTERS PERTAINING TO AERIAL CONQUEST OTHER TYPES OF AIRSHIPS HAVE NOT BEEN IGNORED AS RELATED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER THEY HAVE BEEN FOSTERED UPON A SMALLER BUT EQUALLY EFFECTIVE SCALE
6563-285357-0041 GROSS CRAFT HAVE MET WITH WHOLE HEARTED SUPPORT SINCE THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR VALUE AS VESSELS OF THE AIR WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR MILITARY VALUE THE PARSEVAL IS PRONOUNCED BY EXPERTS TO BE THE FINEST EXPRESSION OF AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING
6563-285357-0042 SO FAR AS TEUTON EFFORT IS CONCERNED CERTAINLY IT HAS PLACED MANY NOTABLE FLIGHTS TO ITS CREDIT THE GROSS AIRSHIP IS AN EQUALLY SERVICEABLE CRAFT
6563-285357-0043 CLOSELY FOLLOWING THOSE OF THE EARLY FRENCH SUPPLE AIRSHIPS THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER CRAFT WHICH HAVE BECOME MORE OR LESS RECOGNISED BY THE GERMAN NATION AS SUBSTANTIAL UNITS OF WAR SUCH AS THE RUTHEMBERG SIEMENS SCHUKERT AND SO FORTH
6563-285357-0044 ALL OF WHICH HAVE PROVED THEIR SERVICEABILITY MORE OR LESS CONCLUSIVELY
6563-63821-0000 PETER FORCE ONE OF THE INTERESTING SIGHTS OF THE CITY OF WASHINGTON USED TO BE THE LIBRARY OF OLD PETER FORCE AS HE WAS FAMILIARLY CALLED COLONEL PETER FORCE AS HE WAS MORE PROPERLY STYLED
6563-63821-0001 HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW COLONELS OF THAT DAY WHO HAD ACTUALLY HELD A COLONEL'S COMMAND HAVING BEEN REGULARLY COMMISSIONED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS A COLONEL OF ARTILLERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HE MIGHT INDEED HAVE BEEN CALLED MAJOR GENERAL
6563-63821-0002 FOR IN HIS OLD AGE HE HELD THAT RANK IN THE MILITIA OF THE DISTRICT AND A VERY FINE LOOKING SOLDIER HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HIS PRIME JUDGING FROM THE PORTRAIT WHICH USED TO HANG IN THE LIBRARY REPRESENTING A FULL FORMED MAN TALL AND ERECT
6563-63821-0003 HIS HANDSOME AND BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE SET OFF BY AN ABUNDANCE OF CURLY HAIR HIS LIBRARY HAD ABOUT THE ROUGHEST FURNITURE EVER SEEN IN AN APARTMENT CONTAINING SO MUCH THAT WAS VALUABLE AS I REMEMBER IT IT WAS A LONG LOW ROOM
6563-63821-0004 WITH STREETS AND CROSS STREETS OF PINE BOOK SHELVES UNPAINTED ALL FILLED WITH BOOKS TO THEIR UTMOST CAPACITY A WILDERNESS OF BOOKS IN PRINT AND IN MANUSCRIPT MOSTLY OLD AND DINGY
6563-63821-0005 AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM RELATING IN SOME WAY TO AMERICAN HISTORY THE PLACE HAD A VERY MUSTY SMELL AND AS MOST OF ITS TREASURES WERE IN THE ORIGINAL BINDINGS OR WITHOUT BINDINGS FEW PERSONS WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED THE PRICELESS VALUE OF THE COLLECTION
6563-63821-0006 I AM ACQUAINTED WITH A CERTAIN LIBRARY IN NEW YORK OF SEVERAL THOUSAND VOLUMES MOST OF WHICH ARE BOUND RESPLENDENTLY IN CALF AND GOLD AND THE ROOM IN WHICH THEY ARE KEPT IS AS SPLENDID AS A STEAMBOAT
6563-63821-0007 BUT OLD PETER FORCE COULD SHOW YOU SINGLE ALCOVES OF HIS LIBRARY WHICH AT A FAIR VALUATION WOULD BUY OUT ALL THAT MASS OF SUMPTUOSITY IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS DUSTY DINGY WILDERNESS
6563-63821-0008 HE WOULD TAKE PLEASURE IN EXHIBITING HIS TREASURES HE WOULD TAKE DOWN HIS EXCELLENT COPY OF ELIOT'S INDIAN BIBLE A BOOK SO FAITHFULLY MADE IN EVERY RESPECT THAT I QUESTION IF AS A MERE PIECE OF BOOK MAKING
6563-63821-0009 IT COULD NOW BE MATCHED IN THE UNITED STATES HE LIVED TO SEE THIS RARITY COMMAND IN NEW YORK THE PRICE OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS HE WOULD SHOW YOU FORTY ONE WORKS IN THE ORIGINAL EDITIONS OF INCREASE AND COTTON MATHER
6563-63821-0010 THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE HE POSSESSED A LARGE NUMBER OF BOOKS PRINTED AND BOUND BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HE HAD TWO HUNDRED VOLUMES OF THE RECORDS OF COLONIAL LEGISLATURES
6563-63821-0011 HE COULD SHOW YOU A NEWSPAPER OF ALMOST EVERY MONTH NAY ALMOST EVERY WEEK SINCE NEWSPAPERS WERE FIRST PUBLISHED IN AMERICA HE HAD IN ALL NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOUND VOLUMES OF NEWSPAPERS OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE VOLUMES
6563-63821-0012 HE WOULD SHOW YOU A COLLECTION OF MORE THAN THIRTY NINE THOUSAND PAMPHLETS OF WHICH EIGHT THOUSAND WERE PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HIS COLLECTION OF MAPS RELATING TO AMERICA WAS TRULY WONDERFUL BESIDES ALL THE EARLY ATLASES OF ANY NOTE
6563-63821-0013 HE HAD OVER A THOUSAND DETACHED MAPS ILLUSTRATIVE BOTH OF THE GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY OF AMERICA FOR MANY OF THEM WERE MAPS AND PLANS DRAWN FOR MILITARY PURPOSES HE WOULD SHOW YOU PERHAPS
6563-63821-0014 A PEN DRAWING OF DATE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE BY A BRITISH OFFICER UPON WHICH WAS WRITTEN PLAN OF THE REBEL WORKS AT WEST POINT HE HAD ALSO SEVERAL PLANS BY BRITISH OFFICERS OF THE REBEL WORKS AROUND BOSTON DURING THE REVOLUTION
6563-63821-0015 BESIDES SUCH THINGS AND HE HAD OVER THREE HUNDRED PLANS AND MAPS OF WHICH THERE WAS NO OTHER COPY IN EXISTENCE HE POSSESSED A SURPRISING NUMBER OF BOOKS PRINTED IN THE INFANCY OF THE PRINTER'S ART AMONG THEM
6563-63821-0016 SPECIMENS REPRESENTING EVERY YEAR FROM FOURTEEN SIXTY SEVEN ONWARD HE HAD MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOOKS PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR SIXTEEN HUNDRED SO ARRANGED THAT A STUDENT COULD TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THE ART OF PRINTING FROM THE DAYS OF CAXTON
6563-63821-0017 HE HAD ALSO A VAST COLLECTION OF MANUSCRIPTS NUMBERING FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE VOLUMES
6563-63821-0018 THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOLUMES IN THE LIBRARY WAS TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE AND THE NUMBER OF PAMPHLETS NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND THE READER PERHAPS IMAGINES THAT THE COLLECTOR OF SUCH A LIBRARY MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY RICH MAN
6563-63821-0019 AND THAT HE TRAVELED FAR AND WIDE IN SEARCH OF THESE PRECIOUS OBJECTS NOT AT ALL HE NEVER WAS A RICH MAN AND I BELIEVE HE RARELY TRAVELED BEYOND THE SIGHT OF THE DOME OF THE CAPITOL INDEED THE MOST WONDERFUL THING ABOUT HIS COLLECTION WAS THAT HE
6563-63821-0020 WHO BEGAN LIFE A JOURNEYMAN PRINTER AND WAS NEVER IN THE RECEIPT OF A LARGE INCOME SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET TOGETHER SO VAST AN AMOUNT OF VALUABLE MATERIAL PART OF THE SECRET WAS THAT WHEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE HIS COLLECTION THESE THINGS WERE NOT VALUED
6563-63821-0021 AND HE OBTAINED MANY OF HIS MOST PRECIOUS RELICS BY MERELY TAKING THE TROUBLE TO CARRY THEM AWAY FROM THE GARRETS IN WHICH THEY WERE MOULDERING INTO DUST UNPRIZED AND UNKNOWN A WISE OLD NEW YORK MERCHANT LONG AGO HIMSELF MOULDERED INTO DUST
6563-63821-0022 USED TO SAY MEN GENERALLY GET IN THIS WORLD EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT HOW CAN THAT BE ASKED A YOUNGSTER ONE DAY
6563-63821-0023 BUT VERY FEW OF THEM EVER WILL BE I WANT A MILLION OR SO MYSELF AH BOY THE OLD MAN REPLIED YOU WANT A MILLION BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT ENOUGH WHAT YOU WANT AT PRESENT IS PLEASURE AND YOU WANT IT SO MUCH
6563-63821-0024 THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SPEND ALL YOUR SURPLUS FORCE TIME AND REVENUE TO GET IT IF YOU WANTED YOUR MILLION AS MUCH AS YOU WANT PLEASURE BY AND BY WHEN YOU HAVE A BALD HEAD LIKE MINE YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR MILLION
6563-63821-0025 PETER FORCE WAS A VERY GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THE OLD MERCHANT'S DOCTRINE HE GOT ALL THESE PRECIOUS THINGS BECAUSE HE WANTED THEM WITH A SUSTAINED PASSION OF DESIRE FOR HALF A CENTURY THERE NEVER WAS A TIME WHEN HE WOULD NOT HAVE GLADLY GOT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
6563-63821-0026 AND WALKED TEN MILES IN THE FACE OF A NORTHEASTERLY STORM TO GET A RARE PAMPHLET OF FOUR PAGES HE WAS A MISER OF SUCH THINGS BUT NO THAT WORD DOES NOT DESCRIBE HIM FOR ONE OF THE GREATEST PLEASURES OF HIS LIFE
6563-63821-0027 WAS TO COMMUNICATE HIS TREASURES TO OTHERS AND HE COMMUNICATED TO THE WHOLE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE BEST OF HIS COLLECTIONS IN MASSIVE VOLUMES OF AMERICAN ARCHIVES HE WAS A MISER ONLY IN THE STRENGTH OF HIS DESIRE MORE THAN ONCE HE SAID TO MISTER GEORGE W GREENE
6563-63821-0028 DID I HESITATE BETWEEN A BARREL OF FLOUR AND A RARE BOOK BUT THE BOOK ALWAYS GOT THE UPPER HAND TO THE SAME FRIEND HE MADE A REMARK WHICH SHOWS THAT HIS DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE WAS QUITE AS STRONG AS HIS DESIRE TO OBTAIN WHENEVER SAID HE
6563-63821-0029 I FOUND A LITTLE MORE MONEY IN MY PURSE THAN I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED I PUBLISHED A VOLUME OF HISTORICAL TRACTS IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THE OLD MAN RELATE HOW THIS TASTE FOR THE TREASURES OF HISTORY WAS FORMED IN HIS MIND HIS FATHER
6563-63821-0030 WHO SERVED DURING THE REVOLUTION IN A NEW JERSEY REGIMENT RETIRED AFTER THE WAR TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND AT HIS HOUSE THE JERSEY VETERANS LIKED TO MEET AND TALK OVER THE INCIDENTS OF THE CAMPAIGNS THEY HAD MADE TOGETHER PETER AS A BOY
6563-63821-0031 LOVED TO HEAR THEM TELL THEIR STORIES AND AS HE LISTENED THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM ONE EVENING WHY SHOULD ALL THIS BE FORGOTTEN BOY AS HE WAS HE BEGAN TO WRITE THEM DOWN UNDER THE TITLE OF THE UNWRITTEN HISTORY OF THE WAR IN NEW JERSEY
6563-63821-0032 HE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE MANUSCRIPT WAS LOST THE TASTE THEN FORMED GREW WITH HIS GROWTH AND STRENGTHENED WITH HIS STRENGTH AT TEN HE LEFT SCHOOL FOREVER AND WENT INTO A PRINTING OFFICE
6563-63821-0033 WHICH HAS PROVED AN EXCELLENT SCHOOL TO MORE THAN ONE VALUABLE AMERICAN MIND HE BECAME AN ACCOMPLISHED PRINTER AND AT TWENTY TWO WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE NEW YORK TYPOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY AN ORGANIZATION WHICH STILL EXISTS
6563-63821-0034 THEN THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE BEGAN LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM HE SERVED IN THE ARMY FIRST AS PRIVATE THEN AS SERGEANT THEN AS SERGEANT MAJOR THEN AS ENSIGN FINALLY AS LIEUTENANT THE WAR ENDED
6563-63821-0035 HE WENT TO WASHINGTON AS FOREMAN OF A PRINTING OFFICE AND AT WASHINGTON AS PRINTER EDITOR PUBLISHER AND COLLECTOR HE LIVED THE REST OF HIS LONG AND HONORABLE LIFE NEVER RICH AS I HAVE BEFORE REMARKED
6563-63821-0036 THOUGH NEVER WITHOUT A SHARE OF REASONABLE PROSPERITY THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK OF HIS LIFE WAS THE PUBLICATION OF THE AMERICAN ARCHIVES IN WHICH HE WAS AIDED BY CONGRESS HE FURNISHING THE DOCUMENTS AND THE LABOR
6563-63821-0037 AND CONGRESS PAYING THE COST OF PUBLICATION THROUGH THE NINE VOLUMES OF THIS WORK A GREAT NUMBER OF THE MOST CURIOUS AND INTERESTING RECORDS AND MEMORIALS OF AMERICAN HISTORY ARE NOT ONLY PRESERVED BUT MADE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS WHO CAN GET NEAR A LIBRARY
6563-63821-0038 HE HAD ALL THE STATE HOUSES OF THE COUNTRY RANSACKED FOR DOCUMENTS AND A ROOM WAS ASSIGNED HIM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN WHICH HIS CLERKS COULD CONVENIENTLY COPY THEM ALL WENT WELL WITH THE WORK UNTIL WILLIAM MARCY BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE
6563-63821-0039 WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO EXAMINE AND APPROVE EACH VOLUME BEFORE IT WENT TO THE PRINTER WHEN PETER FORCE PRESENTED THE MANUSCRIPT OF THE TENTH VOLUME TO SECRETARY MARCY HE RECEIVED A REBUFF WHICH THREW A CLOUD OVER SEVERAL YEARS OF HIS LIFE
6563-63821-0040 I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR WORK SIR SAID THE SECRETARY IT IS OF NO USE TO ANYBODY I NEVER READ A PAGE OF IT AND NEVER EXPECT TO BUT SAID MISTER FORCE THE WORK IS PUBLISHED IN VIRTUE OF A CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT
6563-63821-0041 HERE IS THE MANUSCRIPT OF THE TENTH VOLUME IF THERE IS ANYTHING THERE WHICH YOU THINK OUGHT NOT TO BE THERE HAVE THE GOODNESS TO POINT IT OUT TO ME YOU MAY LEAVE THE PAPERS SIR SAID THE SECRETARY HE LEFT THE PAPERS
6563-63821-0042 BUT NEITHER MARCY NOR HIS SUCCESSORS EVER FOUND TIME TO EXAMINE THAT TENTH VOLUME THOUGH ON THE FIRST DAY OF EVERY OFFICIAL YEAR THE COMPILER CALLED THEIR ATTENTION TO IT FOR SEVEN YEARS HE WAS A SUITOR ON BEHALF OF HIS BELOVED TENTH VOLUME
6563-63821-0043 AND THEN THE WAR OCCURRED AND ALL SUCH MATTERS WERE NECESSARILY PUT ASIDE HE WAS NOW SEVENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE AND HIS GREAT DESIRE WAS TO DISPOSE OF HIS LIBRARY IN SUCH A WAY THAT ITS TREASURES WOULD NOT BE SCATTERED ABROAD
6563-63821-0044 AND PERHAPS LOST FOREVER TO THE COUNTRY AT LENGTH CONGRESS HAVING SANCTIONED THE ENLARGEMENT OF THEIR OWN LIBRARY THEIR LIBRARIAN MISTER SPOFFORD INDUCED THEM TO PURCHASE THE WHOLE MASS JUST AS IT STOOD
6563-63821-0045 FOR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE COLLECTION NOW FORMS PART OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY COLONEL FORCE LIVED TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHEN HE DIED AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSALLY BELOVED AND LAMENTED
6563-63821-0046 IN THE SEVENTY EIGHTH YEAR OF HIS AGE ENJOYING ALMOST TO THE LAST TWO OF THE THINGS HE LOVED BEST HIS BOOKS
