4137-11701-0045 WAS IT FAIR TO DISAPPOINT ONE WHO HAD PERHAPS SOME LITTLE GROUNDS FOR AFTER ALL HE HAD BEEN NO MORE GALLANT THAN WAS CUSTOMARY FROM A PRINCE AND A GENTLEMAN TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IT WAS HER OWN FAULT IF SHE HAD MISTAKEN HIS INTENTIONS
4137-11701-0046 OF COURSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE LEFT EURALIA LONG AGO BUT HE HAD STAYED ON AND WELL DECIDEDLY SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL PERHAPS HE HAD PAID RATHER TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT AND HE HAD CERTAINLY NEGLECTED THE PRINCESS A LITTLE

4137-11702-0007 POOR LITTLE HYACINTH LEFT ALL ALONE BUT THERE SHE HAD HAD THE COUNTESS BELVANE A WOMAN OF GREAT EXPERIENCE TO HELP HER BELVANE SHOULD HE RISK IT HOW MUCH HAD SHE THOUGHT OF HIM WHILE HE WAS AWAY
4137-11702-0008 HYACINTH WOULD BE GROWING UP AND GETTING MARRIED SOON LIFE WOULD BE LONELY IN EURALIA THEN UNLESS SHOULD HE RISK IT

4340-15220-0002 ALL IN SUCH A RAMPANT STATE THAT BUSY MOTHERS WONDERED HOW THEY EVER SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR FRISKY DARLINGS OUT OF MISCHIEF THRIFTY FATHERS PLANNED HOW THEY COULD BRIBE THE IDLE HANDS TO PICK BERRIES OR RAKE HAY AND THE OLD FOLKS
4340-15220-0003 WHILE WISHING THE YOUNG FOLKS WELL SECRETLY BLESSED THE MAN WHO INVENTED SCHOOLS THE GIRLS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT PICNICS AND HAVE THEM TOO FOR LITTLE HATS SPRUNG UP IN THE FIELDS LIKE A NEW SORT OF MUSHROOM
4340-15220-0004 EVERY HILLSIDE BLOOMED WITH GAY GOWNS LOOKING AS IF THE FLOWERS HAD GONE OUT FOR A WALK AND THE WOODS WERE FULL OF FEATHERLESS BIRDS CHIRPING AWAY AS BLITHELY AS THE THRUSHES ROBINS AND WRENS
4340-15220-0005 THE BOYS TOOK TO BASE BALL LIKE DUCKS TO WATER AND THE COMMON WAS THE SCENE OF TREMENDOUS BATTLES WAGED WITH MUCH TUMULT BUT LITTLE BLOODSHED TO THE UNINITIATED IT APPEARED AS IF THESE YOUNG MEN HAD LOST THEIR WITS
