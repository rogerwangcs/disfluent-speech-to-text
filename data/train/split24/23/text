8838-298545-0000 HE SAT IN SILENCE WITH HIS FINE SHOULDERS BOWED AND HIS HEAD UPON HIS HANDS OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GRIMY SURGERY WINDOW OVER A FOREGROUND OF BLACKENED BRICK AND SLATE A LINE OF ENORMOUS CHIMNEYS LIKE CYCLOPEAN PILLARS
8838-298545-0001 UPHELD THE LOWERING DUN COLOURED CLOUD BANK FOR SIX DAYS IN THE WEEK THEY SPOUTED SMOKE BUT TO DAY THE FURNACE FIRES WERE BANKED FOR IT WAS SUNDAY SORDID AND POLLUTING GLOOM HUNG OVER A DISTRICT BLIGHTED AND BLASTED BY THE GREED OF MAN
8838-298545-0002 HE SHOULD BE BACK AGAIN AT THE UNIVERSITY COMPLETING THE LAST YEAR WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM HIS MEDICAL DEGREE BUT ALAS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY WITH WHICH TO PAY HIS CLASS FEES NOR COULD HE IMAGINE HOW HE COULD PROCURE IT
8838-298545-0003 HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS BLACK MEDITATION BY THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR OLDACRE HIMSELF A LARGE CLEAN SHAVEN RESPECTABLE MAN WITH A PRIM MANNER AND AN AUSTERE FACE HE HAD PROSPERED EXCEEDINGLY BY THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL CHURCH INTEREST
8838-298545-0004 AND THE RULE OF HIS LIFE WAS NEVER BY WORD OR ACTION TO RUN A RISK OF OFFENDING THE SENTIMENT WHICH HAD MADE HIM HIS STANDARD OF RESPECTABILITY AND OF DIGNITY WAS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH AND HE EXPECTED THE SAME FROM HIS ASSISTANTS
8838-298545-0005 HIS APPEARANCE AND WORDS WERE ALWAYS VAGUELY BENEVOLENT A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER THE DESPONDENT STUDENT HE WOULD TEST THE REALITY OF THIS PHILANTHROPY I BEG YOUR PARDON DOCTOR OLDACRE SAID HE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR
8838-298545-0006 I HAVE A GREAT FAVOUR TO ASK OF YOU THE DOCTOR'S APPEARANCE WAS NOT ENCOURAGING HIS MOUTH SUDDENLY TIGHTENED AND HIS EYES FELL YES MISTER MONTGOMERY YOU ARE AWARE SIR THAT I NEED ONLY ONE MORE SESSION TO COMPLETE MY COURSE
8838-298545-0007 I AM AFRAID THAT MY DUTIES CALL ME ELSEWHERE MISTER MONTGOMERY ONE MOMENT SIR I HAD HOPED SIR THAT PERHAPS IF I SIGNED A PAPER PROMISING YOU INTEREST UPON YOUR MONEY YOU WOULD ADVANCE THIS SUM TO ME I WILL PAY YOU BACK SIR I REALLY WILL OR
8838-298545-0008 IF YOU LIKE I WILL WORK IT OFF AFTER I AM QUALIFIED THE DOCTOR'S LIPS HAD THINNED INTO A NARROW LINE HIS EYES WERE RAISED AGAIN AND SPARKLED INDIGNANTLY YOUR REQUEST IS UNREASONABLE MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0009 CONSIDER SIR HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF MEDICAL STUDENTS THERE ARE IN THIS COUNTRY NO DOUBT THERE ARE MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEIR FEES AM I TO PROVIDE FOR THEM ALL OR WHY SHOULD I MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN YOUR FAVOUR I AM GRIEVED AND DISAPPOINTED MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0010 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT ME INTO THE PAINFUL POSITION OF HAVING TO REFUSE YOU HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND WALKED WITH OFFENDED DIGNITY OUT OF THE SURGERY THE STUDENT SMILED BITTERLY AND TURNED TO HIS WORK OF MAKING UP THE MORNING PRESCRIPTIONS
8838-298545-0011 HE ONLY EXCELLED IN HIS STRENGTH AND WHERE WAS HE TO FIND A CUSTOMER FOR THAT BUT THE WAYS OF FATE ARE STRANGE AND HIS CUSTOMER WAS AT HAND LOOK Y'ERE SAID A VOICE AT THE DOOR MONTGOMERY LOOKED UP
8838-298545-0012 FOR THE VOICE WAS A LOUD AND RASPING ONE A YOUNG MAN STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE A STOCKY BULL NECKED YOUNG MINER IN TWEED SUNDAY CLOTHES AND AN AGGRESSIVE NECK TIE HE WAS A SINISTER LOOKING FIGURE WITH DARK INSOLENT EYES
8838-298545-0013 AND THE JAW AND THROAT OF A BULLDOG LOOK Y'ERE SAID HE AGAIN WHY HAST THOU NOT SENT T MEDICINE OOP AS THY MASTER ORDERED MONTGOMERY HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE BRUTAL FRANKNESS OF THE NORTHERN WORKER AT FIRST IT HAD ENRAGED HIM
8838-298545-0014 BUT AFTER A TIME HE HAD GROWN CALLOUS TO IT AND ACCEPTED IT AS IT WAS MEANT BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT WAS INSOLENCE BRUTAL OVERBEARING INSOLENCE WITH PHYSICAL MENACE BEHIND IT WHAT NAME HE ASKED COLDLY
8838-298545-0015 THE PROVOCATION WAS SO GROSS THE INSULT SO UNPROVOKED THAT HE COULD HAVE NONE OF THOSE QUALMS WHICH TAKE THE EDGE OFF A MAN'S METTLE HE FINISHED SEALING THE BOTTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS OCCUPIED AND HE ADDRESSED IT AND PLACED IT CAREFULLY IN THE RACK
8838-298545-0016 LOOK HERE SAID HE TURNING ROUND TO THE MINER YOUR MEDICINE WILL BE MADE UP IN ITS TURN AND SENT DOWN TO YOU I DON'T ALLOW FOLK IN THE SURGERY WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE WAITING ROOM IF YOU WISH TO WAIT AT ALL YOONG MAN SAID THE MINER
8838-298545-0017 THE BLOWS WERE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS A SAVAGE SWING WHICH WHISTLED PAST MONTGOMERY'S EAR AND A STRAIGHT DRIVE WHICH TOOK THE WORKMAN ON THE CHIN LUCK WAS WITH THE ASSISTANT THAT SINGLE WHIZZING UPPERCUT AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS DELIVERED
8838-298545-0018 HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE ASSISTANT BREATHING FIERCELY THROUGH HIS NOSE BUT NO ANSWER CAME THE MAN WAS INSENSIBLE AND THEN THE DANGER OF HIS POSITION CAME UPON MONTGOMERY AND HE TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS ANTAGONIST
8838-298545-0019 A SUNDAY THE IMMACULATE DOCTOR OLDACRE WITH HIS PIOUS CONNECTION A SAVAGE BRAWL WITH A PATIENT HE WOULD IRRETRIEVABLY LOSE HIS SITUATION IF THE FACTS CAME OUT IT WAS NOT MUCH OF A SITUATION BUT HE COULD NOT GET ANOTHER WITHOUT A REFERENCE
8838-298545-0020 LOOSENED HIS COLLAR AND SQUEEZED THE SURGERY SPONGE OVER HIS FACE HE SAT UP AT LAST WITH A GASP AND A SCOWL DOMN THEE THOU'S SPOILT MY NECK TIE SAID HE MOPPING UP THE WATER FROM HIS BREAST
8838-298545-0021 I'M SORRY I HIT YOU SO HARD SAID MONTGOMERY APOLOGETICALLY THOU HIT ME HARD I COULD STAN SUCH FLY FLAPPIN ALL DAY TWAS THIS HERE PRESS THAT CRACKED MY PATE FOR ME AND THOU ART A LOOKY MAN TO BE ABLE TO BOAST AS THOU HAST OUTED ME
8838-298545-0022 AND NOW I'D BE OBLIGED TO THEE IF THOU WILT GIVE ME T WIFE'S MEDICINE MONTGOMERY GLADLY MADE IT UP AND HANDED IT TO THE MINER YOU ARE WEAK STILL SAID HE WON'T YOU STAY AWHILE AND REST T WIFE WANTS HER MEDICINE
8838-298545-0023 SAID THE MAN AND LURCHED OUT AT THE DOOR THE ASSISTANT LOOKING AFTER HIM SAW HIM ROLLING WITH AN UNCERTAIN STEP DOWN THE STREET UNTIL A FRIEND MET HIM AND THEY WALKED ON ARM IN ARM THE MAN SEEMED IN HIS ROUGH NORTHERN FASHION TO BEAR NO GRUDGE
8838-298545-0024 YET ALL DAY HE WAS AWARE OF A SENSE OF VAGUE UNEASINESS WHICH SHARPENED INTO DISMAY WHEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS INFORMED THAT THREE GENTLEMEN HAD CALLED AND WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE SURGERY A CORONER'S INQUEST
8838-298545-0025 ABOVE ALL WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT FROM HIM WAS A MOST INEXPLICABLE PROBLEM THE FIRST WAS SORLEY WILSON THE SON OF THE OWNER OF THE NONPAREIL COALPIT HE WAS A YOUNG BLOOD OF TWENTY HEIR TO A FORTUNE A KEEN SPORTSMAN
8838-298545-0026 AND DOWN FOR THE EASTER VACATION FROM MAGDALENE COLLEGE HE SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF THE SURGERY TABLE LOOKING IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE AT MONTGOMERY AND TWISTING THE ENDS OF HIS SMALL BLACK WAXED MOUSTACHE THE SECOND WAS PURVIS THE PUBLICAN
8838-298545-0027 AND HE ALSO LEANED FORWARD IN SILENCE FROM HIS CHAIR A FAT RED HAND UPON EITHER KNEE AND STARED CRITICALLY AT THE YOUNG ASSISTANT SO DID THE THIRD VISITOR FAWCETT THE HORSE BREAKER WHO LEANED BACK HIS LONG THIN LEGS WITH THEIR BOXCLOTH RIDING GAITERS
8838-298545-0028 NO IT'S OFF IT'S NOWT STAND OOP LAD LET'S SEE THEE STANDIN IT WAS THE PUBLICAN WHO SPOKE MONTGOMERY OBEYED HE WOULD LEARN ALL ABOUT IT NO DOUBT IF HE WERE PATIENT
8838-298545-0029 A HUNDRED AND THIRTY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IF HE'S AN OUNCE WELL THE MASTER DOESN'T SCALE MUCH MORE THAN THAT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS HOG FAT AND LIVING HIGH WORK THE GREASE OUT OF HIM AND I LAY THERE'S NO GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
8838-298545-0030 HAVE YOU BEEN WEIGHED LATELY MISTER MONTGOMERY IT WAS THE FIRST DIRECT QUESTION WHICH HAD BEEN ASKED HIM HE HAD STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THEM LIKE A HORSE AT A FAIR AND HE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO WONDER WHETHER HE WAS MORE ANGRY OR AMUSED I AM JUST ELEVEN STONE SAID HE
8838-298545-0031 BUT TRAININ FOR EVERYDAY WORK AIN'T THE SAME AS TRAININ WITH A TRAINER AND I DARE BET WITH ALL RESPEC TO YOUR OPINION MISTER WILSON THAT THERE'S HALF A STONE OF TALLOW ON HIM AT THIS MINUTE THE YOUNG CANTAB PUT HIS FINGERS ON THE ASSISTANT'S UPPER ARM
8838-298545-0032 THEN WITH HIS OTHER HAND ON HIS WRIST HE BENT THE FOREARM SHARPLY AND FELT THE BICEPS AS ROUND AND HARD AS A CRICKET BALL SPRING UP UNDER HIS FINGERS FEEL THAT SAID HE THE PUBLICAN AND HORSE BREAKER FELT IT WITH AN AIR OF REVERENCE
8838-298545-0033 GOOD LAD HE'LL DO YET CRIED PURVIS GENTLEMEN SAID MONTGOMERY I THINK THAT YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE BOON VERY PATIENT WITH YOU
8838-298545-0034 AND NOW I MUST REALLY BEG THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TELL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER THEY ALL SAT DOWN IN THEIR SERIOUS BUSINESS LIKE WAY THAT'S EASY DONE MISTER MONTGOMERY SAID THE FAT VOICED PUBLICAN BUT BEFORE SAYIN ANYTHING WE HAD TO WAIT AND SEE WHETHER
8838-298545-0035 FOR IT WOULD BE SOMETHIN NEW TO FIND ISAAC FAWCETT AS A SPOIL SPORT WELL THEN WE WILL MAKE UP THE HUNDRED FOR THE STAKE AMONG US AND THE FIGHT STANDS ALWAYS SUPPOSIN THE YOUNG MAN IS WILLIN EXCUSE ALL THIS ROT MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0036 SAID THE UNIVERSITY MAN IN A GENIAL VOICE WE'VE BEGUN AT THE WRONG END I KNOW BUT WE'LL SOON STRAIGHTEN IT OUT
8838-298545-0037 YOU REMEMBER THE MAN WHOM YOU KNOCKED OUT THIS MORNING HE IS BARTON THE FAMOUS TED BARTON I'M SURE SIR YOU MAY WELL BE PROUD TO HAVE OUTED HIM IN ONE ROUND SAID THE PUBLICAN WHY IT TOOK MORRIS THE TEN STONE SIX CHAMPION
8838-298545-0038 A DEAL MORE TROUBLE THAN THAT BEFORE HE PUT BARTON TO SLEEP YOU'VE DONE A FINE PERFORMANCE SIR AND HAPPEN YOU'LL DO A FINER IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE CHANCE I NEVER HEARD OF TED BARTON BEYOND SEEING THE NAME ON A MEDICINE LABEL SAID THE ASSISTANT WELL
8838-298545-0039 YOU MAY TAKE IT FROM ME THAT HE'S A SLAUGHTERER SAID THE HORSE BREAKER YOU'VE TAUGHT HIM A LESSON THAT HE NEEDED FOR IT WAS ALWAYS A WORD AND A BLOW WITH HIM AND THE WORD ALONE WAS WORTH FIVE SHILLIN IN A PUBLIC COURT HE WON'T BE SO READY NOW TO SHAKE HIS NIEF IN THE FACE OF EVERYONE HE MEETS
8838-298545-0040 HOWEVER THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE MONTGOMERY LOOKED AT THEM IN BEWILDERMENT FOR GOODNESS SAKE GENTLEMEN TELL ME WHAT IT IS YOU WANT ME TO DO HE CRIED WE WANT YOU TO FIGHT SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298545-0041 BUT WHY BECAUSE TED BARTON WAS TO HAVE FOUGHT HIM NEXT SATURDAY HE WAS THE CHAMPION OF THE WILSON COAL PITS AND THE OTHER WAS THE MASTER OF THE IRON FOLK DOWN AT THE CROXLEY SMELTERS WE'D MATCHED OUR MAN FOR A PURSE OF A HUNDRED AGAINST THE MASTER
8838-298545-0042 BUT YOU'VE QUEERED OUR MAN AND HE CAN'T FACE SUCH A BATTLE WITH A TWO INCH CUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE SIR
8838-298545-0043 IF YOU CAN LICK TED BARTON YOU MAY LICK THE MASTER OF CROXLEY BUT IF YOU DON'T WE'RE DONE FOR THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WHO IS IN THE SAME STREET WITH HIM IN THIS DISTRICT IT'S TWENTY ROUNDS TWO OUNCE GLOVES QUEENSBERRY RULES AND A DECISION ON POINTS IF YOU FIGHT TO THE FINISH
8838-298545-0044 FOR A MOMENT THE ABSURDITY OF THE THING DROVE EVERY OTHER THOUGHT OUT OF MONTGOMERY'S HEAD
8838-298545-0045 ALL HE WANTED TO COMPLETE HIS EDUCATION WAS LYING THERE READY TO HIS HAND IF ONLY THAT HAND WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO PICK IT UP HE HAD THOUGHT BITTERLY THAT MORNING THAT THERE WAS NO MARKET FOR HIS STRENGTH
8838-298545-0046 THAN HIS BRAINS IN A YEAR BUT A CHILL OF DOUBT CAME OVER HIM HOW CAN I FIGHT FOR THE COAL PITS SAID HE I AM NOT CONNECTED WITH THEM EH LAD BUT THOU ART CRIED OLD PURVIS WE'VE GOT IT DOWN IN WRITIN AND IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH
8838-298545-0047 IT WOULD BE A VERY SPORTING THING OF YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY IF YOU WOULD COME TO OUR HELP WHEN WE ARE IN SUCH A HOLE OF COURSE YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE TO TAKE THE HUNDRED POUNDS BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IN THE CASE OF YOUR WINNING WE COULD ARRANGE THAT IT SHOULD TAKE THE FORM OF A WATCH OR PIECE OF PLATE
8838-298545-0048 OR ANY OTHER SHAPE WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST ITSELF TO YOU YOU SEE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR HAVING LOST OUR CHAMPION SO WE REALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE A CLAIM UPON YOU GIVE ME A MOMENT GENTLEMEN IT IS VERY UNEXPECTED
8838-298545-0049 I AM AFRAID THE DOCTOR WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO MY GOING IN FACT I AM SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT BUT HE NEED NEVER KNOW NOT BEFORE THE FIGHT AT ANY RATE WE ARE NOT BOUND TO GIVE THE NAME OF OUR MAN SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE WEIGHT LIMITS ON THE DAY OF THE FIGHT THAT IS ALL THAT CONCERNS ANYONE
8838-298545-0050 THOU'LL RISE IN ONE DAY FROM BEING JUST A COMMON DOCTOR TO THE BEST KNOWN MON TWIXT HERE AND BRADFORD THOU ART A WITHERIN TYKE THOU ART AND NO MISTAKE AND IF THOU BEAT THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL THE BEER THOU WANT FOR THE REST OF THY LIFE WAITING FOR THEE AT THE FOUR SACKS
8838-298545-0051 IT IS THE MOST SPORTING THING I EVER HEARD OF IN MY LIFE SAID YOUNG WILSON BY GEORGE SIR IF YOU PULL IT OFF YOU'VE GOT THE CONSTITUENCY IN YOUR POCKET IF YOU CARE TO STAND YOU KNOW THE OUT HOUSE IN MY GARDEN NEXT THE ROAD EXACTLY
8838-298545-0052 THEN YOU'LL WANT A SPARRING PARTNER OGILVY HAS BEEN ACTING FOR BARTON BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT HE IS CLASS ENOUGH BARTON BEARS YOU NO GRUDGE HE'S A GOOD HEARTED FELLOW THOUGH CROSS GRAINED WITH STRANGERS HE LOOKED UPON YOU AS A STRANGER THIS MORNING BUT HE SAYS HE KNOWS YOU NOW
8838-298546-0000 IT WAS TRUE THAT HIS TEACHER WAS LONG PAST HIS PRIME SLOW UPON HIS FEET AND STIFF IN HIS JOINTS BUT EVEN SO HE WAS STILL A TOUGH ANTAGONIST BUT MONTGOMERY HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT HE COULD MORE THAN HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIM HE HAD WON THE UNIVERSITY MEDAL AND HIS TEACHER
8838-298546-0001 IN WHICH HE HAD THE WORST OF IT BUT HAD MADE THE PRIZE FIGHTER STRETCH HIMSELF TO THE UTTERMOST THERE WAS HIS WHOLE RECORD AND WAS IT ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STAND UP TO THE MASTER OF CROXLEY HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE MASTER BEFORE
8838-298546-0002 BUT THEN HE HAD LOST TOUCH OF THE RING DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HARD WORK AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER IF HE WON THERE WAS THE MONEY WHICH MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM IF HE LOST IT WOULD ONLY MEAN A THRASHING HE COULD TAKE PUNISHMENT WITHOUT FLINCHING OF THAT HE WAS CERTAIN
8838-298546-0003 MATCHED AGAINST A PUGILIST OVER AT CROXLEY I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE LAW DOES NOT STEP IN AND STOP SO DEGRADING AN EXHIBITION IT IS REALLY A PRIZE FIGHT A GLOVE FIGHT YOU SAID
8838-298546-0004 I AM INFORMED THAT A TWO OZ GLOVE IS AN EVASION BY WHICH THEY DODGE THE LAW AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE TO INTERFERE
8838-298546-0005 TO THINK THAT SUCH SCENES CAN BE ENACTED WITHIN A FEW MILES OF OUR PEACEFUL HOME BUT YOU WILL REALISE MISTER MONTGOMERY THAT WHILE THERE ARE SUCH INFLUENCES FOR US TO COUNTERACT IT IS VERY NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD LIVE UP TO OUR HIGHEST
8838-298546-0006 THE DOCTOR'S SERMON WOULD HAVE HAD MORE EFFECT IF THE ASSISTANT HAD NOT ONCE OR TWICE HAD OCCASION TO TEST HIS HIGHEST AND COME UPON IT AT UNEXPECTEDLY HUMBLE ELEVATIONS IT IS ALWAYS SO PARTICULARLY EASY TO
8838-298546-0007 COMPOUND FOR SINS WE'RE MOST INCLINED TO BY DAMNING THOSE WE HAVE NO MIND TO IN ANY CASE MONTGOMERY FELT THAT OF ALL THE MEN CONCERNED IN SUCH A FIGHT PROMOTERS BACKERS SPECTATORS IT IS THE ACTUAL FIGHTER
8838-298546-0008 WHO HOLDS THE STRONGEST AND MOST HONOURABLE POSITION HIS CONSCIENCE GAVE HIM NO CONCERN UPON THE SUBJECT ENDURANCE AND COURAGE ARE VIRTUES NOT VICES AND BRUTALITY IS AT LEAST BETTER THAN EFFEMINACY
8838-298546-0009 THE ASSISTANT STROLLED DOWN THERE AFTER TEA AND ASKED IN A CASUAL WAY WHETHER THE TOBACCONIST HAD EVER HEARD OF THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298546-0010 THE LITTLE MAN COULD HARDLY ARTICULATE IN HIS ASTONISHMENT WHY SIR HE'S THE FIRST MON O THE DISTRICT AN HIS NAME'S AS WELL KNOWN IN THE WEST RIDING AS THE WINNER O T DERBY BUT LOR SIR HERE HE STOPPED AND RUMMAGED AMONG A HEAP OF PAPERS
8838-298546-0011 AND SO THE CROXLEY HERALD HAS HIS LIFE AN RECORD AN HERE IT IS AN THOU CANST READ IT FOR THYSEL THE SHEET OF THE PAPER WHICH HE HELD UP WAS A LAKE OF PRINT AROUND AN ISLET OF ILLUSTRATION THE LATTER WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT OF A PUGILIST'S HEAD AND NECK
8838-298546-0012 SILAS CRAGGS AND BENEATH THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL ABOUT HIM THERE SIR SAID THE TOBACCONIST HE'S A WITHERIN TYKE HE IS AND WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE HIM IN THE COUNTY IF HE HADN'T BROKE HIS LEG HE'D HAVE BEEN CHAMPION OF ENGLAND
8838-298546-0013 BROKE HIS LEG HAS HE YES AND IT SET BADLY THEY CA HIM OWD K BEHIND HIS BACK FOR THAT IS HOW HIS TWO LEGS LOOK BUT HIS ARMS WELL IF THEY WAS BOTH STROPPED TO A BENCH AS THE SAYIN IS
8838-298546-0014 I'LL TAKE THIS WITH ME SAID MONTGOMERY AND PUTTING THE PAPER INTO HIS POCKET HE RETURNED HOME IT WAS NOT A CHEERING RECORD WHICH HE READ THERE THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE CROXLEY MASTER WAS GIVEN IN FULL HIS MANY VICTORIES HIS FEW DEFEATS
8838-298546-0015 BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN SAID THE PROVINCIAL BIOGRAPHER SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN IN SPORTING CIRCLES AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY IS NOW IN HIS FORTIETH YEAR HANG IT I'M ONLY TWENTY THREE
8838-298546-0016 AND WON THE PROUD TITLE WHICH HE STILL HOLDS AMBITIOUS OF A MORE THAN LOCAL FAME HE SECURED A PATRON AND FOUGHT HIS FIRST FIGHT AGAINST JACK BARTON OF BIRMINGHAM IN MAY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AT THE OLD LOITERERS CLUB CRAGGS
8838-298546-0017 WHO FOUGHT AT TEN STONE TWO AT THE TIME HAD THE BETTER OF FIFTEEN RATTLING ROUNDS AND GAINED AN AWARD ON POINTS AGAINST THE MIDLANDER HAVING DISPOSED OF JAMES DUNN OF ROTHERHITHE CAMERON OF GLASGOW AND A YOUTH NAMED FERNIE
8838-298546-0018 IT WAS OWING TO THIS THAT HE WAS DEFEATED IN SEVEN ROUNDS BY WILLOX THE MAN WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEATEN AND AFTERWARDS BY JAMES SHAW OF LONDON THOUGH THE LATTER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD FOUND THE TOUGHEST CUSTOMER OF HIS CAREER UNDISMAYED BY HIS REVERSES
8838-298546-0019 THE MASTER ADAPTED THE STYLE OF HIS FIGHTING TO HIS PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND RESUMED HIS CAREER OF VICTORY DEFEATING NORTON THE BLACK HOBBY WILSON AND LEVI COHEN THE LATTER A HEAVY WEIGHT CONCEDING TWO STONE HE FOUGHT A DRAW WITH THE FAMOUS BILLY MC QUIRE
8838-298546-0020 WHO MAY WISH TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BAR ROOM SCRAMBLE AND A SCIENTIFIC CONTEST THE LATEST OF THESE AMBITIOUS SOULS COMES FROM THE WILSON COAL PITS WHICH HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO PUT UP A STAKE OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS AND BACK THEIR LOCAL CHAMPION
8838-298546-0021 THERE ARE VARIOUS RUMOURS AFLOAT AS TO WHO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS TO BE THE NAME OF TED BARTON BEING FREELY MENTIONED BUT THE BETTING WHICH IS SEVEN TO ONE ON THE MASTER AGAINST ANY UNTRIED MAN IS A FAIR REFLECTION OF THE FEELING OF THE COMMUNITY
8838-298546-0022 NO LIGHT MATTER THIS WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN NO BATTLE WITH A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHTER WHO PRESUMED UPON A LOCAL REPUTATION THE MAN'S RECORD SHOWED THAT HE WAS FIRST CLASS OR NEARLY SO THERE WERE A FEW POINTS IN HIS FAVOUR AND HE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEM
8838-298546-0023 THERE WAS AGE TWENTY THREE AGAINST FORTY THERE WAS AN OLD RING PROVERB THAT YOUTH WILL BE SERVED BUT THE ANNALS OF THE RING OFFER A GREAT NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS A HARD VETERAN FULL OF COOL VALOUR AND RING CRAFT
8838-298546-0024 COULD GIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND A BEATING TO MOST STRIPLINGS HE COULD NOT RELY TOO MUCH UPON HIS ADVANTAGE IN AGE BUT THEN THERE WAS THE LAMENESS THAT MUST SURELY COUNT FOR A GREAT DEAL AND LASTLY THERE WAS THE CHANCE THAT THE MASTER MIGHT UNDERRATE HIS OPPONENT
8838-298546-0025 THAT HE MIGHT BE REMISS IN HIS TRAINING AND REFUSE TO ABANDON HIS USUAL WAY OF LIFE IF HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD AN EASY TASK BEFORE HIM IN A MAN OF HIS AGE AND HABITS THIS SEEMED VERY POSSIBLE MONTGOMERY PRAYED THAT IT MIGHT BE SO
8838-298546-0026 MEANWHILE IF HIS OPPONENT WERE THE BEST MAN WHO EVER JUMPED THE ROPES INTO A RING HIS OWN DUTY WAS CLEAR HE MUST PREPARE HIMSELF CAREFULLY THROW AWAY NO CHANCE AND DO THE VERY BEST THAT HE COULD BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE WHICH EXISTS IN BOXING AS IN EVERY SPORT
8838-298546-0027 BETWEEN THE AMATEUR AND THE PROFESSIONAL THE COOLNESS THE POWER OF HITTING ABOVE ALL THE CAPABILITY OF TAKING PUNISHMENT COUNT FOR SO MUCH THOSE SPECIALLY DEVELOPED GUTTA PERCHA LIKE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES OF THE HARDENED PUGILIST
8838-298546-0028 WILL TAKE WITHOUT FLINCHING A BLOW WHICH WOULD LEAVE ANOTHER MAN WRITHING ON THE GROUND SUCH THINGS ARE NOT TO BE ACQUIRED IN A WEEK BUT ALL THAT COULD BE DONE IN A WEEK SHOULD BE DONE THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT HAD A GOOD BASIS TO START FROM
8838-298546-0029 TALL ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ON TWO LEGS AS THE OLD RING MEN USED TO SAY LITHE AND SPARE WITH THE ACTIVITY OF A PANTHER AND A STRENGTH WHICH HAD HARDLY YET EVER FOUND ITS LIMITATIONS HIS MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT WAS FINELY HARD
8838-298546-0030 BUT AS THE VISITING WAS DONE ON FOOT AND CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES HAD TO BE TRAVERSED IT WAS A TRAINING IN ITSELF FOR THE REST HE PUNCHED THE SWINGING BALL AND WORKED WITH THE DUMB BELLS FOR AN HOUR EVERY MORNING AND EVENING AND BOXED TWICE A DAY WITH TED BARTON IN THE GYMNASIUM
8838-298546-0031 GAINING AS MUCH PROFIT AS COULD BE GOT FROM A RUSHING TWO HANDED SLOGGER BARTON WAS FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS CLEVERNESS AND QUICKNESS BUT DOUBTFUL ABOUT HIS STRENGTH HARD HITTING WAS THE FEATURE OF HIS OWN STYLE AND HE EXACTED IT FROM OTHERS
8838-298546-0032 ALL THOT'S BETTER MON THOT'S FINE HE WOULD ADD AS HIS OPPONENT LIFTED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM ON THE END OF A RIGHT COUNTER THOT'S HOW I LIKES TO FEEL EM HAPPEN THOU'LT PULL THROUGH YET HE CHUCKLED WITH JOY WHEN MONTGOMERY KNOCKED HIM INTO A CORNER
8838-298546-0033 THESE CAUSELESS WHIMS AND FANCIES ARE VERY MUCH TO BE DEPRECATED MISTER MONTGOMERY CONSIDER HOW MANY THERE ARE TO WHOM THESE VERY POTATOES AND THIS VERY BEER WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE NO DOUBT SIR BUT AT PRESENT I PREFER TO DO WITHOUT THEM
8838-298546-0034 I SHOULD DO A DOUBLE DAY'S WORK ON FRIDAY SO AS TO LEAVE EVERYTHING IN ORDER I SHOULD HOPE TO BE BACK IN THE EVENING I AM AFRAID I CANNOT SPARE YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY THIS WAS A FACER IF HE COULD NOT GET LEAVE HE WOULD GO WITHOUT IT
8838-298546-0035 YOU WILL REMEMBER DOCTOR OLDACRE THAT WHEN I CAME TO YOU IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT I SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR DAY EVERY MONTH I HAVE NEVER CLAIMED ONE BUT NOW THERE ARE REASONS WHY I WISH TO HAVE A HOLIDAY UPON SATURDAY DOCTOR OLDACRE GAVE IN WITH A VERY BAD GRACE
8838-298546-0036 OF COURSE IF YOU INSIST UPON YOUR FORMAL RIGHTS THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID MISTER MONTGOMERY THOUGH I FEEL THAT IT SHOWS A CERTAIN INDIFFERENCE TO MY COMFORT AND THE WELFARE OF THE PRACTICE DO YOU STILL INSIST YES SIR VERY GOOD HAVE YOUR WAY
8838-298546-0037 A QUIET RESOLUTION IN HIS VOICE AS HE CLAIMED HIS SATURDAY WHICH AROUSED HIS CURIOSITY I HAVE NO DESIRE TO INTERFERE UNDULY WITH YOUR AFFAIRS MISTER MONTGOMERY BUT WERE YOU THINKING OF HAVING A DAY IN LEEDS UPON SATURDAY NO SIR
8838-298546-0038 IN THE COUNTRY YES SIR YOU ARE VERY WISE YOU WILL FIND A QUIET DAY AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS A VERY VALUABLE RESTORATIVE HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION I AM GOING OVER CROXLEY WAY
8838-298546-0039 A VERY INTERESTING RELIC OF THE EARLY NORMAN ERA BY THE WAY THERE IS ONE OBJECTION WHICH I SEE TO YOUR GOING TO CROXLEY ON SATURDAY IT IS UPON THAT DATE AS I AM INFORMED THAT THAT RUFFIANLY GLOVE FIGHT TAKES PLACE
8838-298546-0040 YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF MOLESTED BY THE BLACKGUARDS WHOM IT WILL ATTRACT I WILL TAKE MY CHANCE OF THAT SIR SAID THE ASSISTANT ON THE FRIDAY NIGHT WHICH WAS THE LAST NIGHT BEFORE THE FIGHT
8838-298546-0041 HE'S SIMPLY RIPPING SAID THE UNDERGRADUATE

8838-298546-0043 HE KEPT POKING HIS FINGER INTO MONTGOMERY AS IF HE WERE ONE OF HIS HORSES I HEAR THAT THE MASTER WILL SCALE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ODD AT THE RING SIDE BUT THERE'S SOME OF THAT WHICH HE'D LIKE WELL TO PULL OFF AND LEAVE BEHIND WI HIS SHIRT SAID PURVIS
8838-298546-0044 I HEAR THEY'VE HAD A RARE JOB TO GET HIM TO DROP HIS BEER AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT GREAT RED HEADED WENCH OF HIS

8838-298546-0046 THE DOOR OF THE GYMNASIUM HAD OPENED AND A LAD ABOUT SIXTEEN GRIMY AND BLACK WITH SOOT AND IRON STEPPED INTO THE YELLOW GLARE OF THE OIL LAMP TED BARTON SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR

887-123289-0001 IT WAS BECAUSE THE POWERFUL ARM OF HANS CAME TO MY RESCUE THE BRAVE ICELANDER CARRIED ME OUT OF THE REACH OF THE WAVES OVER A BURNING SAND WHERE I FOUND MYSELF BY THE SIDE OF MY UNCLE
887-123289-0002 THEN HE RETURNED TO THE ROCKS AGAINST WHICH THE FURIOUS WAVES WERE BEATING TO SAVE WHAT HE COULD I WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK I WAS SHATTERED WITH FATIGUE AND EXCITEMENT
887-123289-0003 I WANTED A WHOLE HOUR TO RECOVER EVEN A LITTLE BUT A DELUGE OF RAIN WAS STILL FALLING THOUGH WITH THAT VIOLENCE WHICH GENERALLY DENOTES THE NEAR CESSATION OF A STORM
887-123289-0004 THE NEXT DAY THE WEATHER WAS SPLENDID THE SKY AND THE SEA HAD SUNK INTO SUDDEN REPOSE EVERY TRACE OF THE AWFUL STORM HAD DISAPPEARED
887-123289-0005 THE EXHILARATING VOICE OF THE PROFESSOR FELL UPON MY EARS AS I AWOKE HE WAS OMINOUSLY CHEERFUL WELL MY BOY HE CRIED HAVE YOU SLEPT WELL
887-123289-0006 AND THAT I WAS ONLY JUST COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND THAT I WAS TO BE MARRIED TO GRAEUBEN THAT DAY ALAS IF THE TEMPEST HAD BUT SENT THE RAFT A LITTLE MORE EAST WE SHOULD HAVE PASSED UNDER GERMANY UNDER MY BELOVED TOWN OF HAMBURG
887-123289-0007 UNDER THE VERY STREET WHERE DWELT ALL THAT I LOVED MOST IN THE WORLD THEN ONLY FORTY LEAGUES WOULD HAVE SEPARATED US BUT THEY WERE FORTY LEAGUES PERPENDICULAR OF SOLID GRANITE WALL AND IN REALITY WE WERE A THOUSAND LEAGUES ASUNDER
887-123289-0008 ALL THESE PAINFUL REFLECTIONS RAPIDLY CROSSED MY MIND BEFORE I COULD ANSWER MY UNCLE'S QUESTION WELL NOW HE REPEATED WON'T YOU TELL ME HOW YOU HAVE SLEPT OH VERY WELL I SAID
887-123289-0009 I AM ONLY A LITTLE KNOCKED UP BUT I SHALL SOON BE BETTER OH SAYS MY UNCLE THAT'S NOTHING TO SIGNIFY YOU ARE ONLY A LITTLE BIT TIRED BUT YOU UNCLE YOU SEEM IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS THIS MORNING
887-123289-0010 BUT MY DEAR UNCLE DO LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION OF COURSE AXEL HOW ABOUT RETURNING RETURNING WHY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RETURN BEFORE THE ARRIVAL NO
887-123289-0011 I ONLY WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT IS TO BE MANAGED IN THE SIMPLEST WAY POSSIBLE WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE EITHER WE SHALL FIND SOME NEW WAY TO GET BACK OR WE SHALL COME BACK LIKE DECENT FOLKS THE WAY WE CAME
887-123289-0012 I FEEL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS SURE NOT TO BE SHUT AGAINST US BUT THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO REFIT THE RAFT OF COURSE THEN AS TO PROVISIONS HAVE WE ENOUGH TO LAST
887-123289-0013 YES TO BE SURE WE HAVE HANS IS A CLEVER FELLOW AND I AM SURE HE MUST HAVE SAVED A LARGE PART OF OUR CARGO BUT STILL LET US GO AND MAKE SURE
887-123289-0014 WE LEFT THIS GROTTO WHICH LAY OPEN TO EVERY WIND AT THE SAME TIME I CHERISHED A TREMBLING HOPE WHICH WAS A FEAR AS WELL IT SEEMED TO ME IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE TERRIBLE WRECK OF THE RAFT SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED EVERYTHING ON BOARD
887-123289-0015 ON MY ARRIVAL ON THE SHORE I FOUND HANS SURROUNDED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTICLES ALL ARRANGED IN GOOD ORDER MY UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH A LIVELY GRATITUDE THIS MAN WITH ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DEVOTION
887-123289-0016 AND HAD SAVED THE MOST PRECIOUS OF THE ARTICLES AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE NOT THAT WE HAD SUFFERED NO LOSSES FOR INSTANCE OUR FIREARMS BUT WE MIGHT DO WITHOUT THEM OUR STOCK OF POWDER HAD REMAINED UNINJURED
887-123289-0017 AFTER HAVING RISKED BLOWING UP DURING THE STORM WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR AS WE HAVE NO GUNS WE CANNOT HUNT THAT'S ALL YES BUT HOW ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS HERE IS THE ANEROID THE MOST USEFUL OF ALL
887-123289-0018 AND FOR WHICH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL THE OTHERS BY MEANS OF IT I CAN CALCULATE THE DEPTH AND KNOW WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE WITHOUT IT
887-123289-0019 SUCH HIGH SPIRITS AS THESE WERE RATHER TOO STRONG BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASS I ASKED HERE IT IS UPON THIS ROCK IN PERFECT CONDITION AS WELL AS THE THERMOMETERS AND THE CHRONOMETER THE HUNTER IS A SPLENDID FELLOW
887-123289-0020 THERE WAS NO DENYING IT WE HAD ALL OUR INSTRUMENTS AS FOR TOOLS AND APPLIANCES THERE THEY ALL LAY ON THE GROUND LADDERS ROPES PICKS SPADES ET CETERA STILL THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONS TO BE SETTLED AND I ASKED
887-123289-0021 HOW ARE WE OFF FOR PROVISIONS THE BOXES CONTAINING THESE WERE IN A LINE UPON THE SHORE IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION FOR THE MOST PART THE SEA HAD SPARED THEM AND WHAT WITH BISCUITS SALT MEAT SPIRITS AND SALT FISH
887-123289-0022 FOUR MONTHS CRIED THE PROFESSOR WE HAVE TIME TO GO AND TO RETURN
887-123289-0023 I OUGHT BY THIS TIME TO HAVE BEEN QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO MY UNCLE'S WAYS YET THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING FRESH ABOUT HIM TO ASTONISH ME NOW SAID HE
887-123289-0024 THEREFORE WE SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO FEAR ANYTHING FROM THIRST AS FOR THE RAFT I WILL RECOMMEND HANS TO DO HIS BEST TO REPAIR IT ALTHOUGH I DON'T EXPECT IT WILL BE OF ANY FURTHER USE TO US HOW SO I CRIED AN IDEA OF MY OWN MY LAD
887-123289-0025 I DON'T THINK WE SHALL COME OUT BY THE WAY THAT WE WENT IN I STARED AT THE PROFESSOR WITH A GOOD DEAL OF MISTRUST I ASKED WAS HE NOT TOUCHED IN THE BRAIN AND YET THERE WAS METHOD IN HIS MADNESS AND NOW LET US GO TO BREAKFAST SAID HE
887-123289-0026 I FOLLOWED HIM TO A HEADLAND AFTER HE HAD GIVEN HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE HUNTER THERE PRESERVED MEAT BISCUIT AND TEA MADE US AN EXCELLENT MEAL ONE OF THE BEST I EVER REMEMBER HUNGER THE FRESH AIR THE CALM QUIET WEATHER
887-123289-0027 AFTER THE COMMOTIONS WE HAD GONE THROUGH ALL CONTRIBUTED TO GIVE ME A GOOD APPETITE WHILST BREAKFASTING I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO MY UNCLE THE QUESTION WHERE WE WERE NOW THAT SEEMS TO ME I SAID RATHER DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT
887-123289-0028 YES IT IS DIFFICULT HE SAID TO CALCULATE EXACTLY PERHAPS EVEN IMPOSSIBLE SINCE DURING THESE THREE STORMY DAYS I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO KEEP ANY ACCOUNT OF THE RATE OR DIRECTION OF THE RAFT BUT STILL WE MAY GET AN APPROXIMATION
887-123289-0029 THE LAST OBSERVATION I REMARKED WAS MADE ON THE ISLAND WHEN THE GEYSER WAS YOU MEAN AXEL ISLAND DON'T DECLINE THE HONOUR OF HAVING GIVEN YOUR NAME TO THE FIRST ISLAND EVER DISCOVERED IN THE CENTRAL PARTS OF THE GLOBE WELL SAID I
887-123289-0030 LET IT BE AXEL ISLAND THEN WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LEAGUES OF SEA AND WE WERE SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM ICELAND VERY WELL ANSWERED MY UNCLE LET US START FROM THAT POINT AND COUNT FOUR DAYS STORM
887-123289-0031 SURELY AXEL IT MAY VIE IN SIZE WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN ITSELF ESPECIALLY I REPLIED IF IT HAPPENS THAT WE HAVE ONLY CROSSED IT IN ITS NARROWEST PART AND IT IS A CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE I ADDED THAT IF MY COMPUTATIONS ARE RIGHT
887-123289-0032 THAT IS A GOOD LONG WAY MY FRIEND BUT WHETHER WE ARE UNDER TURKEY OR THE ATLANTIC DEPENDS VERY MUCH UPON THE QUESTION
887-123289-0033 PERHAPS WE HAVE DEVIATED NO I THINK NOT
887-123289-0034 WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE WE MAY EASILY ASCERTAIN THIS BY CONSULTING THE COMPASS LET US GO AND SEE WHAT IT SAYS THE PROFESSOR MOVED TOWARDS THE ROCK UPON WHICH HANS HAD LAID DOWN THE INSTRUMENTS
887-123289-0035 HE WAS GAY AND FULL OF SPIRITS HE RUBBED HIS HANDS HE STUDIED HIS ATTITUDES I FOLLOWED HIM CURIOUS TO KNOW IF I WAS RIGHT IN MY ESTIMATE AS SOON AS WE HAD ARRIVED AT THE ROCK MY UNCLE TOOK THE COMPASS LAID IT HORIZONTALLY
887-123289-0036 AND QUESTIONED THE NEEDLE WHICH AFTER A FEW OSCILLATIONS PRESENTLY ASSUMED A FIXED POSITION MY UNCLE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AGAIN HE RUBBED HIS EYES
887-123289-0037 AND THEN TURNED TO ME THUNDERSTRUCK WITH SOME UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY WHAT IS THE MATTER I ASKED
887-123289-0038 AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT BURST FROM ME THE NORTH POLE OF THE NEEDLE WAS TURNED TO WHAT WE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SOUTH IT POINTED TO THE SHORE INSTEAD OF TO THE OPEN SEA I SHOOK THE BOX EXAMINED IT AGAIN
887-123289-0039 IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION IN WHATEVER POSITION I PLACED THE BOX THE NEEDLE PERTINACIOUSLY RETURNED TO THIS UNEXPECTED QUARTER
887-123290-0000 WE HAD GONE BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS BUT MY UNCLE RAPIDLY RECOVERED HIMSELF AHA WILL FATE PLAY TRICKS UPON ME WILL THE ELEMENTS LAY PLOTS AGAINST ME
887-123290-0001 SHALL FIRE AIR AND WATER MAKE A COMBINED ATTACK AGAINST ME WELL THEY SHALL KNOW WHAT A DETERMINED MAN CAN DO I WILL NOT YIELD I WILL NOT STIR A SINGLE FOOT BACKWARDS AND IT WILL BE SEEN WHETHER MAN OR NATURE IS TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND
887-123290-0002 ERECT UPON THE ROCK ANGRY AND THREATENING OTTO LIEDENBROCK WAS A RATHER GROTESQUE FIERCE PARODY UPON THE FIERCE ACHILLES DEFYING THE LIGHTNING BUT I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY TO INTERPOSE AND ATTEMPT TO LAY SOME RESTRAINT UPON THIS UNMEASURED FANATICISM
887-123290-0003 JUST LISTEN TO ME I SAID FIRMLY AMBITION MUST HAVE A LIMIT SOMEWHERE WE CANNOT PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES WE ARE NOT AT ALL FIT FOR ANOTHER SEA VOYAGE WHO WOULD DREAM OF UNDERTAKING A VOYAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES UPON A HEAP OF ROTTEN PLANKS
887-123290-0004 WITH A BLANKET IN RAGS FOR A SAIL A STICK FOR A MAST AND FIERCE WINDS IN OUR TEETH WE CANNOT STEER WE SHALL BE BUFFETED BY THE TEMPESTS AND WE SHOULD BE FOOLS AND MADMEN TO ATTEMPT TO CROSS A SECOND TIME
887-123290-0005 I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THIS SERIES OF UNANSWERABLE REASONS FOR TEN MINUTES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION NOT THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS PAYING ANY RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO HIS NEPHEW'S ARGUMENTS BUT BECAUSE HE WAS DEAF TO ALL MY ELOQUENCE
887-123290-0006 TO THE RAFT HE SHOUTED SUCH WAS HIS ONLY REPLY IT WAS NO USE FOR ME TO ENTREAT SUPPLICATE GET ANGRY OR DO ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WAY OF OPPOSITION
887-123290-0007 HANS WAS FINISHING THE REPAIRS OF THE RAFT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS STRANGE BEING WAS GUESSING AT MY UNCLE'S INTENTIONS WITH A FEW MORE PIECES OF SURTURBRAND HE HAD REFITTED OUR VESSEL
887-123290-0008 A SAIL ALREADY HUNG FROM THE NEW MAST AND THE WIND WAS PLAYING IN ITS WAVING FOLDS THE PROFESSOR SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE GUIDE AND IMMEDIATELY HE PUT EVERYTHING ON BOARD AND ARRANGED EVERY NECESSARY FOR OUR DEPARTURE
887-123290-0009 THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND THE NORTH WEST WIND BLEW STEADILY WHAT COULD I DO COULD I STAND AGAINST THE TWO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IF HANS HAD BUT TAKEN MY SIDE BUT NO IT WAS NOT TO BE
887-123290-0010 THE ICELANDER SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED ALL WILL OF HIS OWN AND MADE A VOW TO FORGET AND DENY HIMSELF I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF A SERVANT SO FEUDALISED AS IT WERE TO HIS MASTER MY ONLY COURSE WAS TO PROCEED
887-123290-0011 I WAS THEREFORE GOING WITH AS MUCH RESIGNATION AS I COULD FIND TO RESUME MY ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON THE RAFT WHEN MY UNCLE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WE SHALL NOT SAIL UNTIL TO MORROW HE SAID
887-123290-0012 I WILL NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL I HAVE EXAMINED IT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FOLLOWED IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT
887-123290-0013 WE WERE NOT REALLY WHERE THE PROFESSOR SUPPOSED WE WERE IN FACT WE WERE NOT UPON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE SEA NOW LET US START UPON FRESH DISCOVERIES I SAID AND LEAVING HANS TO HIS WORK WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER
887-123290-0014 THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS WAS CONSIDERABLE IT TOOK HALF AN HOUR TO BRING US TO THE WALL OF ROCK WE TRAMPLED UNDER OUR FEET NUMBERLESS SHELLS OF ALL THE FORMS AND SIZES WHICH EXISTED IN THE EARLIEST AGES OF THE WORLD
887-123290-0015 I ALSO SAW IMMENSE CARAPACES MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER
887-123290-0016 AND RIDGED UP IN SUCCESSIVE LINES I WAS THEREFORE LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AT ONE TIME THE SEA MUST HAVE COVERED THE GROUND ON WHICH WE WERE TREADING ON THE LOOSE AND SCATTERED ROCKS
887-123290-0017 THE WAVES HAD LEFT MANIFEST TRACES OF THEIR POWER TO WEAR THEIR WAY IN THE HARDEST STONE THIS MIGHT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF AN OCEAN FORTY LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE BUT IN MY OPINION
887-123290-0018 THIS LIQUID MASS WOULD BE LOST BY DEGREES FARTHER AND FARTHER WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH AND IT CERTAINLY HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE WATERS OF THE OCEAN OVERHEAD WHICH HAD MADE THEIR WAY HITHER THROUGH SOME FISSURE YET
887-123290-0019 IT MUST BE BELIEVED THAT THAT FISSURE IS NOW CLOSED AND THAT ALL THIS CAVERN OR IMMENSE RESERVOIR WAS FILLED IN A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS EVEN THIS WATER SUBJECTED TO THE FIERCE ACTION OF CENTRAL HEAT HAD PARTLY BEEN RESOLVED INTO VAPOUR
887-123290-0020 AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ELECTRICITY WHICH RAISED SUCH TEMPESTS WITHIN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH THIS THEORY OF THE PHENOMENA WE HAD WITNESSED SEEMED SATISFACTORY TO ME FOR HOWEVER GREAT AND STUPENDOUS THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE
887-123290-0021 FIXED PHYSICAL LAWS WILL OR MAY ALWAYS EXPLAIN THEM WE WERE THEREFORE WALKING UPON SEDIMENTARY SOIL THE DEPOSITS OF THE WATERS OF FORMER AGES THE PROFESSOR WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING EVERY LITTLE FISSURE IN THE ROCKS
887-123290-0022 WHEREVER HE SAW A HOLE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF IT TO HIM THIS WAS IMPORTANT WE HAD TRAVERSED THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA FOR A MILE WHEN WE OBSERVED A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SOIL IT SEEMED UPSET CONTORTED
887-123290-0023 WHERE THE REMAINS OF TWENTY AGES MINGLED THEIR DUST TOGETHER HUGE MOUNDS OF BONY FRAGMENTS ROSE STAGE AFTER STAGE IN THE DISTANCE THEY UNDULATED AWAY TO THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON AND MELTED IN THE DISTANCE IN A FAINT
887-123290-0024 HAZE THERE WITHIN THREE SQUARE MILES WERE ACCUMULATED THE MATERIALS FOR A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL LIFE OF AGES A HISTORY SCARCELY OUTLINED IN THE TOO RECENT STRATA OF THE INHABITED WORLD
887-123290-0025 BUT AN IMPATIENT CURIOSITY IMPELLED OUR STEPS CRACKLING AND RATTLING OUR FEET WERE TRAMPLING ON THE REMAINS OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS AND INTERESTING FOSSILS THE POSSESSION OF WHICH IS A MATTER OF RIVALRY AND CONTENTION
887-123290-0026 A THOUSAND CUVIERS COULD NEVER HAVE RECONSTRUCTED THE ORGANIC REMAINS DEPOSITED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT AND UNPARALLELED COLLECTION I STOOD AMAZED MY UNCLE HAD UPLIFTED HIS LONG ARMS TO THE VAULT WHICH WAS OUR SKY
887-123290-0027 HIS MOUTH GAPING WIDE HIS EYES FLASHING BEHIND HIS SHINING SPECTACLES HIS HEAD BALANCING WITH AN UP AND DOWN MOTION HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE DENOTED UNLIMITED ASTONISHMENT HERE HE STOOD FACING AN IMMENSE COLLECTION OF SCATTERED
887-123290-0028 LEPTOTHERIA MERICOTHERIA LOPHIODIA ANOPLOTHERIA MEGATHERIA MASTODONS PROTOPITHECAE PTERODACTYLES AND ALL SORTS OF EXTINCT MONSTERS HERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER FOR HIS SPECIAL SATISFACTION
887-123290-0029 FANCY AN ENTHUSIASTIC BIBLIOMANIAC SUDDENLY BROUGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THE FAMOUS ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY BURNT BY OMAR AND RESTORED BY A MIRACLE FROM ITS ASHES JUST SUCH A CRAZED ENTHUSIAST WAS MY UNCLE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
887-123290-0030 BUT MORE WAS TO COME WHEN
887-123290-0031 HE LAID HIS HAND UPON A BARE SKULL AND CRIED WITH A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT AXEL AXEL A HUMAN HEAD A HUMAN SKULL I CRIED NO LESS ASTONISHED
887-123291-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT THE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND THIS APOSTROPHE OF MY UNCLE'S MADE TO ABSENT FRENCH SAVANTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ALLUDE TO AN EVENT OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
887-123291-0001 IN A PALAEONTOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW WHICH HAD OCCURRED A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
887-123291-0002 NEAR ABBEVILLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOMME FOUND A HUMAN JAWBONE FOURTEEN FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE IT WAS THE FIRST FOSSIL OF THIS NATURE THAT HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT NOT FAR DISTANT
887-123291-0003 WERE FOUND STONE HATCHETS AND FLINT ARROW HEADS STAINED AND ENCASED BY LAPSE OF TIME WITH A UNIFORM COAT OF RUST THE NOISE OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS VERY GREAT NOT IN FRANCE ALONE BUT IN ENGLAND AND IN GERMANY
887-123291-0004 SAW AT ONCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY PROVED TO DEMONSTRATION THE GENUINENESS OF THE BONE IN QUESTION AND BECAME THE MOST ARDENT DEFENDANTS IN WHAT THE ENGLISH CALLED THIS TRIAL OF A JAWBONE
887-123291-0005 THEREFORE THE GENUINENESS OF A FOSSIL HUMAN RELIC OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BE INCONTESTABLY PROVED AND ADMITTED IT IS TRUE THAT THIS THEORY MET WITH A MOST OBSTINATE OPPONENT
887-123291-0006 AND AGREEING IN THAT WITH CUVIER HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT THE HUMAN SPECIES COULD BE CONTEMPORARY WITH THE ANIMALS OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK ALONG WITH THE GREAT BODY OF THE GEOLOGISTS HAD MAINTAINED HIS GROUND DISPUTED AND ARGUED UNTIL
887-123291-0007 WE KNEW ALL THESE DETAILS BUT WE WERE NOT AWARE THAT SINCE OUR DEPARTURE THE QUESTION HAD ADVANCED TO FARTHER STAGES OTHER SIMILAR MAXILLARIES THOUGH BELONGING TO INDIVIDUALS OF VARIOUS TYPES AND DIFFERENT NATIONS WERE FOUND IN THE LOOSE GREY SOIL
887-123291-0008 OF CERTAIN GROTTOES IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM AS WELL AS WEAPONS TOOLS EARTHEN UTENSILS BONES OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS THE EXISTENCE THEREFORE OF MAN IN THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BECOME DAILY MORE CERTAIN
887-123291-0009 NOR WAS THIS ALL FRESH DISCOVERIES OF REMAINS IN THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION HAD EMBOLDENED OTHER GEOLOGISTS TO REFER BACK THE HUMAN SPECIES TO A HIGHER ANTIQUITY STILL IT IS TRUE THAT THESE REMAINS WERE NOT HUMAN BONES
887-123291-0010 BUT OBJECTS BEARING THE TRACES OF HIS HANDIWORK SUCH AS FOSSIL LEG BONES OF ANIMALS SCULPTURED AND CARVED EVIDENTLY BY THE HAND OF MAN
887-123291-0011 HE WAS A PREDECESSOR OF THE MASTODON HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SOUTHERN ELEPHANT HE LIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN ACCORDING TO GEOLOGISTS THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION WAS IN PROGRESS
887-123291-0012 SUCH THEN WAS THE STATE OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND WHAT WE KNEW OF IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN OUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS STUPENDOUS GOLGOTHA ANY ONE MAY NOW UNDERSTAND THE FRENZIED EXCITEMENT OF MY UNCLE WHEN
887-123291-0013 TWENTY YARDS FARTHER ON HE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A PRIMITIVE MAN IT WAS A PERFECTLY RECOGNISABLE HUMAN BODY HAD SOME PARTICULAR SOIL LIKE THAT OF THE CEMETERY SAINT MICHEL AT BORDEAUX
887-123291-0014 PRESERVED IT THUS FOR SO MANY AGES IT MIGHT BE SO BUT THIS DRIED CORPSE WITH ITS PARCHMENT LIKE SKIN DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER THE BONY FRAME THE LIMBS STILL PRESERVING THEIR SHAPE SOUND TEETH ABUNDANT HAIR
887-123291-0015 AND FINGER AND TOE NAILS OF FRIGHTFUL LENGTH THIS DESICCATED MUMMY STARTLED US BY APPEARING JUST AS IT HAD LIVED COUNTLESS AGES AGO I STOOD MUTE BEFORE THIS APPARITION OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY MY UNCLE USUALLY SO GARRULOUS
887-123291-0016 WAS STRUCK DUMB LIKEWISE WE RAISED THE BODY WE STOOD IT UP AGAINST A ROCK IT SEEMED TO STARE AT US OUT OF ITS EMPTY ORBITS WE SOUNDED WITH OUR KNUCKLES HIS HOLLOW FRAME AFTER SOME MOMENTS SILENCE THE PROFESSOR WAS HIMSELF AGAIN
887-123291-0017 OTTO LIEDENBROCK YIELDING TO HIS NATURE FORGOT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY FORGOT WHERE WE WERE STANDING FORGOT THE VAULTED CAVERN WHICH CONTAINED US NO DOUBT HE WAS IN MIND BACK AGAIN IN HIS JOHANNAEUM
887-123291-0018 HOLDING FORTH TO HIS PUPILS FOR HE ASSUMED HIS LEARNED AIR AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE HE PROCEEDED THUS GENTLEMEN I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN OF THE QUATERNARY OR POST TERTIARY SYSTEM
887-123291-0019 EMINENT GEOLOGISTS HAVE DENIED HIS EXISTENCE OTHERS NO LESS EMINENT HAVE AFFIRMED IT THE SAINT THOMASES OF PALAEONTOLOGY IF THEY WERE HERE MIGHT NOW TOUCH HIM WITH THEIR FINGERS AND WOULD BE OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ERROR
887-123291-0020 I AM QUITE AWARE THAT SCIENCE HAS TO BE ON ITS GUARD WITH DISCOVERIES OF THIS KIND I KNOW WHAT CAPITAL ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUALS LIKE BARNUM HAVE MADE OUT OF FOSSIL MEN I HAVE HEARD THE TALE OF THE KNEEPAN OF AJAX
887-123291-0021 THE PRETENDED BODY OF ORESTES CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE SPARTANS AND OF THE BODY OF ASTERIUS TEN CUBITS LONG
887-123291-0022 I HAVE READ THE REPORTS OF THE SKELETON OF TRAPANI FOUND IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY AND WHICH WAS AT THE TIME IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF POLYPHEMUS AND THE HISTORY OF THE GIANT UNEARTHED IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY NEAR PALERMO
887-123291-0023 YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO GENTLEMEN THE ANALYSIS MADE AT LUCERNE IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE HUGE BONES WHICH THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR FELIX PLATER AFFIRMED TO BE THOSE OF A GIANT NINETEEN FEET HIGH
887-123291-0024 IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I WOULD HAVE STOOD UP FOR SCHEUCHZER'S PRE ADAMITE MAN AGAINST PETER CAMPET I HAVE PERUSED A WRITING
887-123291-0025 HERE MY UNCLE'S UNFORTUNATE INFIRMITY MET HIM THAT OF BEING UNABLE IN PUBLIC TO PRONOUNCE HARD WORDS
887-123291-0026 HE COULD GET NO FURTHER
887-123291-0027 IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
887-123291-0028 HAVE RECOGNISED IN THESE BONES NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTH AND OTHER MAMMALS OF THE POST TERTIARY PERIOD BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SPECIMEN TO DOUBT WOULD BE TO INSULT SCIENCE THERE STANDS THE BODY YOU MAY SEE IT TOUCH IT
887-123291-0029 IT IS NOT A MERE SKELETON IT IS AN ENTIRE BODY
887-123291-0030 I WAS GOOD ENOUGH NOT TO CONTRADICT THIS STARTLING ASSERTION IF I COULD ONLY WASH IT IN A SOLUTION OF SULPHURIC ACID PURSUED MY UNCLE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAR IT FROM ALL THE EARTHY PARTICLES AND THE SHELLS WHICH ARE INCRUSTED ABOUT IT
887-123291-0031 BUT I DO NOT POSSESS THAT VALUABLE SOLVENT YET SUCH AS IT IS THE BODY SHALL TELL US ITS OWN WONDERFUL STORY HERE THE PROFESSOR LAID HOLD OF THE FOSSIL SKELETON AND HANDLED IT WITH THE SKILL OF A DEXTEROUS SHOWMAN
887-123291-0032 YOU SEE HE SAID THAT IT IS NOT SIX FEET LONG AND THAT WE ARE STILL SEPARATED BY A LONG INTERVAL FROM THE PRETENDED RACE OF GIANTS
887-123291-0033 IT IS EVIDENTLY CAUCASIAN IT IS THE WHITE RACE OUR OWN THE SKULL OF THIS FOSSIL IS A REGULAR OVAL OR RATHER OVOID IT EXHIBITS NO PROMINENT CHEEKBONES NO PROJECTING JAWS
887-123291-0034 IT PRESENTS NO APPEARANCE OF THAT PROGNATHISM
887-123291-0035 IT IS NEARLY NINETY DEGREES BUT I WILL GO FURTHER IN MY DEDUCTIONS AND I WILL AFFIRM THAT THIS SPECIMEN OF THE HUMAN FAMILY IS OF THE JAPHETIC RACE WHICH HAS SINCE SPREAD FROM THE INDIES TO THE ATLANTIC DON'T SMILE GENTLEMEN NOBODY WAS SMILING
887-123291-0036 BUT THE LEARNED PROFESSOR WAS FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BY THE BROAD SMILES PROVOKED BY HIS LEARNED ECCENTRICITIES YES HE PURSUED WITH ANIMATION THIS IS A FOSSIL MAN THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE MASTODONS WHOSE REMAINS FILL THIS AMPHITHEATRE
887-123291-0037 HOW THOSE STRATA ON WHICH HE LAY SLIPPED DOWN INTO THIS ENORMOUS HOLLOW IN THE GLOBE I CONFESS I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION
887-123291-0038 CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THE LONG CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
887-123291-0039 BUT THERE IS THE MAN SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN WORKS BY HATCHETS BY FLINT ARROW HEADS
887-123291-0040 THIS FOSSIL BODY WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS IMMENSE CATACOMB WE CAME UPON OTHER BODIES AT EVERY STEP AMONGST THIS MORTAL DUST AND MY UNCLE MIGHT SELECT THE MOST CURIOUS OF THESE SPECIMENS TO DEMOLISH THE INCREDULITY OF SCEPTICS
887-123291-0041 IN FACT IT WAS A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE THAT OF THESE GENERATIONS OF MEN AND ANIMALS COMMINGLED IN A COMMON CEMETERY THEN ONE VERY SERIOUS QUESTION AROSE PRESENTLY WHICH WE SCARCELY DARED TO SUGGEST
887-123291-0042 HAD ALL THOSE CREATURES SLIDED THROUGH A GREAT FISSURE IN THE CRUST OF THE EARTH DOWN TO THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA WHEN THEY WERE DEAD AND TURNING TO DUST OR HAD THEY LIVED AND GROWN AND DIED HERE IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD UNDER A FALSE SKY
