302-123504-0000 A FIGHT THAT WON FRIENDS THE THING WHICH MORE NEARLY RESEMBLED OUR EARTHLY MEN THAN IT DID THE MARTIANS I HAD SEEN HELD ME PINIONED TO THE GROUND WITH ONE HUGE FOOT
302-123504-0001 WHILE IT JABBERED AND GESTICULATED AT SOME ANSWERING CREATURE BEHIND ME THIS OTHER WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY ITS MATE SOON CAME TOWARD US BEARING A MIGHTY STONE CUDGEL
302-123504-0002 WITH WHICH IT EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO BRAIN ME THE CREATURES WERE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET TALL STANDING ERECT AND HAD LIKE THE GREEN MARTIANS AN INTERMEDIARY SET OF ARMS OR LEGS
302-123504-0003 MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS THEIR EYES WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND NON PROTRUDING THEIR EARS WERE HIGH SET BUT MORE LATERALLY LOCATED THAN THOSE OF THE MARTIANS
302-123504-0004 WHEN A BOLT OF MYRIAD LEGGED HORROR HURLED ITSELF THROUGH THE DOORWAY FULL UPON THE BREAST OF MY EXECUTIONER WITH A SHRIEK OF FEAR THE APE WHICH HELD ME LEAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW BUT ITS MATE CLOSED IN A TERRIFIC
302-123504-0005 DEATH STRUGGLE WITH MY PRESERVER WHICH WAS NOTHING LESS THAN MY FAITHFUL WATCH THING I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL SO HIDEOUS A CREATURE A DOG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I GAINED MY FEET AND BACKING AGAINST THE WALL I WITNESSED SUCH A
302-123504-0006 BATTLE AS IT IS VOUCHSAFED FEW BEINGS TO SEE THE STRENGTH AGILITY AND BLIND FEROCITY OF THESE TWO CREATURES IS APPROACHED BY NOTHING KNOWN TO EARTHLY MAN
302-123504-0007 MY BEAST HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS FIRST HOLD HAVING SUNK HIS MIGHTY FANGS FAR INTO THE BREAST OF HIS ADVERSARY BUT THE GREAT ARMS AND PAWS OF THE APE
302-123504-0008 BACKED BY MUSCLES FAR TRANSCENDING THOSE OF THE MARTIAN MEN I HAD SEEN HAD LOCKED THE THROAT OF MY GUARDIAN AND SLOWLY WERE CHOKING OUT HIS LIFE AND BENDING BACK HIS HEAD AND NECK UPON HIS BODY
302-123504-0009 WHERE I MOMENTARILY EXPECTED THE FORMER TO FALL LIMP AT THE END OF A BROKEN NECK IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS THE APE WAS TEARING AWAY THE ENTIRE FRONT OF ITS BREAST WHICH WAS HELD IN THE VISE LIKE GRIP OF THE POWERFUL JAWS
302-123504-0010 BACK AND FORTH UPON THE FLOOR THEY ROLLED NEITHER ONE EMITTING A SOUND OF FEAR OR PAIN PRESENTLY I SAW THE GREAT EYES OF MY BEAST BULGING COMPLETELY FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND BLOOD FLOWING FROM ITS NOSTRILS
302-123504-0011 BUT SO ALSO WAS THE APE WHOSE STRUGGLES WERE GROWING MOMENTARILY LESS SUDDENLY I CAME TO MYSELF
302-123504-0012 I SEIZED THE CUDGEL WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE BATTLE AND SWINGING IT WITH ALL THE POWER OF MY EARTHLY ARMS I CRASHED IT FULL UPON THE HEAD OF THE APE CRUSHING HIS SKULL AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN AN EGGSHELL
302-123504-0013 SCARCELY HAD THE BLOW DESCENDED WHEN I WAS CONFRONTED WITH A NEW DANGER THE APE'S MATE RECOVERED FROM ITS FIRST SHOCK OF TERROR HAD RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF THE ENCOUNTER BY WAY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING
302-123504-0014 I GLIMPSED HIM JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOORWAY AND THE SIGHT OF HIM NOW ROARING AS HE PERCEIVED HIS LIFELESS FELLOW STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS RAGE FILLED ME I MUST CONFESS
302-123504-0015 WITH DIRE FOREBODINGS I AM EVER WILLING TO STAND AND FIGHT WHEN THE ODDS ARE NOT TOO OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I PERCEIVED NEITHER GLORY NOR PROFIT
302-123504-0016 AGAINST THE IRON MUSCLES AND BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THIS ENRAGED DENIZEN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN FACT THE ONLY OUTCOME OF SUCH AN ENCOUNTER SO FAR AS I MIGHT BE CONCERNED SEEMED SUDDEN DEATH
302-123504-0017 I WAS STANDING NEAR THE WINDOW AND I KNEW THAT ONCE IN THE STREET I MIGHT GAIN THE PLAZA AND SAFETY BEFORE THE CREATURE COULD OVERTAKE ME AT LEAST THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
302-123504-0018 AGAINST ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH SHOULD I REMAIN AND FIGHT HOWEVER DESPERATELY IT IS TRUE I HELD THE CUDGEL BUT WHAT COULD I DO WITH IT AGAINST HIS FOUR GREAT ARMS
302-123504-0019 EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
302-123504-0020 IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
302-123504-0021 HIS GREAT EYES FASTENED UPON ME IN WHAT SEEMED A PITIFUL APPEAL FOR PROTECTION I COULD NOT WITHSTAND THAT LOOK NOR COULD I ON SECOND THOUGHT HAVE DESERTED MY RESCUER WITHOUT GIVING AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF IN HIS BEHALF
302-123504-0022 AS HE HAD IN MINE WITHOUT MORE ADO THEREFORE I TURNED TO MEET THE CHARGE OF THE INFURIATED BULL APE HE WAS NOW TOO CLOSE UPON ME FOR THE CUDGEL TO PROVE OF ANY EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE
302-123504-0023 SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
302-123504-0024 WITH ARMS WIDE STRETCHED TO EASE HIS FALL AGAIN AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY I HAD RECOURSE TO EARTHLY TACTICS AND SWINGING MY RIGHT FIST FULL UPON THE POINT OF HIS CHIN
302-123504-0025 I BEHELD TARS TARKAS SOLA AND THREE OR FOUR WARRIORS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE CHAMBER AS MY EYES MET THEIRS I WAS FOR THE SECOND TIME THE RECIPIENT OF THEIR ZEALOUSLY GUARDED APPLAUSE
302-123504-0026 MY ABSENCE HAD BEEN NOTED BY SOLA ON HER AWAKENING AND SHE HAD QUICKLY INFORMED TARS TARKAS WHO HAD SET OUT IMMEDIATELY WITH A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS TO SEARCH FOR ME AS THEY HAD APPROACHED THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
302-123504-0027 THIS ENCOUNTER TOGETHER WITH MY SET TO WITH THE MARTIAN WARRIOR ON THE PREVIOUS DAY AND MY FEATS OF JUMPING PLACED ME UPON A HIGH PINNACLE IN THEIR REGARD EVIDENTLY DEVOID OF ALL THE FINER SENTIMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP
302-123504-0028 LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
302-123504-0029 STRENGTH AND COURAGE SOLA WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED THE SEARCHING PARTY OF HER OWN VOLITION WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MARTIANS WHOSE FACE HAD NOT BEEN TWISTED IN LAUGHTER AS I BATTLED FOR MY LIFE SHE ON THE CONTRARY
302-123504-0030 WAS SOBER WITH APPARENT SOLICITUDE AND AS SOON AS I HAD FINISHED THE MONSTER RUSHED TO ME AND CAREFULLY EXAMINED MY BODY FOR POSSIBLE WOUNDS OR INJURIES SATISFYING HERSELF THAT I HAD COME OFF UNSCATHED SHE SMILED QUIETLY
302-123504-0031 AND TAKING MY HAND STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER TARS TARKAS AND THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD ENTERED AND WERE STANDING OVER THE NOW RAPIDLY REVIVING BRUTE WHICH HAD SAVED MY LIFE
302-123504-0032 THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
302-123504-0033 AND TURNED TO FOLLOW US FROM THE ROOM THERE SEEMED SOMETHING MENACING IN THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD MY BEAST AND I HESITATED TO LEAVE UNTIL I HAD LEARNED THE OUTCOME IT WAS WELL I DID SO FOR THE WARRIOR DREW AN
302-123504-0034 EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
302-123504-0035 BLOWING A HOLE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WOOD AND MASONRY I THEN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE FEARSOME LOOKING THING AND RAISING IT TO ITS FEET MOTIONED FOR IT TO FOLLOW ME
302-123504-0036 AND SOLA GRASPING ME TIGHTLY BY THE ARM I HAD AT LEAST TWO FRIENDS ON MARS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WATCHED OVER ME WITH MOTHERLY SOLICITUDE AND A DUMB BRUTE WHICH AS I LATER CAME TO KNOW
302-123504-0037 HELD IN ITS POOR UGLY CARCASS MORE LOVE MORE LOYALTY MORE GRATITUDE
302-123516-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHAINED IN WARHOON IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
302-123516-0001 AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
302-123516-0002 RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
302-123516-0003 HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
302-123516-0004 AND DEPENDING FROM THESE A NUMBER OF DRIED HUMAN HANDS HIS REFERENCE TO THE GREAT GAMES OF WHICH I HAD HEARD SO MUCH WHILE AMONG THE THARKS CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD BUT JUMPED FROM PURGATORY INTO GEHENNA
302-123516-0005 AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH THE FEMALE DURING WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOW FULLY FIT TO TRAVEL THE JED ORDERED THAT WE MOUNT AND RIDE AFTER THE MAIN COLUMN
302-123516-0006 I WAS STRAPPED SECURELY TO AS WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE A THOAT AS I HAD EVER SEEN AND WITH A MOUNTED WARRIOR ON EITHER SIDE TO PREVENT THE BEAST FROM BOLTING
302-123516-0007 WE RODE FORTH AT A FURIOUS PACE IN PURSUIT OF THE COLUMN MY WOUNDS GAVE ME BUT LITTLE PAIN SO WONDERFULLY AND RAPIDLY HAD THE APPLICATIONS AND INJECTIONS OF THE FEMALE EXERCISED THEIR THERAPEUTIC POWERS
302-123516-0008 WHO PROVED TO BE THE JEDDAK OF THE HORDES OF WARHOON LIKE THE JED WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY SCARRED AND ALSO DECORATED WITH THE BREASTPLATE OF HUMAN SKULLS AND DRIED DEAD HANDS
302-123516-0009 WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
302-123516-0010 WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
302-123516-0011 HE ENTIRELY OMITTED THE USUAL FORMAL SALUTATION AS WE ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE JEDDAK AND AS HE PUSHED ME ROUGHLY BEFORE THE RULER HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD AND MENACING VOICE
302-123516-0012 I HAVE BROUGHT A STRANGE CREATURE WEARING THE METAL OF A THARK WHOM IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAVE BATTLE WITH A WILD THOAT AT THE GREAT GAMES HE WILL DIE AS BAR COMAS YOUR JEDDAK SEES FIT IF AT ALL
302-123516-0013 WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
302-123516-0014 RATHER THAN BY A WATER HEARTED WEAKLING FROM WHOM EVEN OLD DAK KOVA COULD TEAR THE METAL WITH HIS BARE HANDS BAR COMAS EYED THE DEFIANT AND INSUBORDINATE CHIEFTAIN FOR AN INSTANT HIS EXPRESSION ONE OF HAUGHTY
302-123516-0015 FEARLESS CONTEMPT AND HATE AND THEN WITHOUT DRAWING A WEAPON AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE HURLED HIMSELF AT THE THROAT OF HIS DEFAMER
302-123516-0016 I NEVER BEFORE HAD SEEN TWO GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS BATTLE WITH NATURE'S WEAPONS AND THE EXHIBITION OF ANIMAL FEROCITY WHICH ENSUED WAS AS FEARFUL A THING AS THE MOST DISORDERED IMAGINATION COULD PICTURE
302-123516-0017 BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
302-123516-0018 BREAKING AWAY FROM A CLINCH IT WAS THE ONE LITTLE OPENING THAT DAK KOVA NEEDED AND HURLING HIMSELF AT THE BODY OF HIS ADVERSARY
302-123516-0019 AND WITH A LAST POWERFUL EFFORT RIPPED THE YOUNG JEDDAK WIDE OPEN THE FULL LENGTH OF HIS BODY THE GREAT TUSK
302-123516-0020 VICTOR AND VANQUISHED ROLLED LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE MOSS A HUGE MASS OF TORN AND BLOODY FLESH
302-123516-0021 BAR COMAS WAS STONE DEAD AND ONLY THE MOST HERCULEAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF DAK KOVA'S FEMALES SAVED HIM FROM THE FATE HE DESERVED THREE DAYS LATER HE WALKED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO THE BODY OF BAR COMAS WHICH
302-123516-0022 BY CUSTOM HAD NOT BEEN MOVED FROM WHERE IT FELL AND PLACING HIS FOOT UPON THE NECK OF HIS ERSTWHILE RULER HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF JEDDAK OF WARHOON
302-123516-0023 THE INJURIES TO DAK KOVA HAD DELAYED THE MARCH SO GREATLY THAT IT WAS DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHICH WAS A RAID UPON A SMALL THARK COMMUNITY IN RETALIATION FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INCUBATOR UNTIL AFTER THE GREAT GAMES
302-123516-0024 THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
302-123516-0025 FOOD WAS BROUGHT ME AT INTERVALS BUT OWING TO THE UTTER DARKNESS OF THE PLACE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I LAY THERE DAYS OR WEEKS OR MONTHS IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF ALL MY LIFE
302-123516-0026 AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
302-123516-0027 AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
302-123516-0028 ALTHOUGH I AT FIRST BOMBARDED HIM WITH QUESTIONS FINALLY ALL THE HATRED AND MANIACAL LOATHING FOR THESE AWFUL CREATURES WHO HAD PLACED ME IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WAS CENTERED BY MY TOTTERING REASON UPON THIS SINGLE EMISSARY
302-123516-0029 WHO REPRESENTED TO ME THE ENTIRE HORDE OF WARHOONS I HAD NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS ADVANCED WITH HIS DIM TORCH TO WHERE HE COULD PLACE THE FOOD WITHIN MY REACH AND AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE IT UPON THE FLOOR
302-123516-0030 SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
302-123516-0031 I WAITED HIS COMING CROUCHING LIKE SOME BEAST OF PREY AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE MY FOOD UPON THE GROUND I SWUNG THE CHAIN ABOVE MY HEAD AND CRASHED THE LINKS WITH ALL MY STRENGTH UPON HIS SKULL WITHOUT A SOUND
302-123516-0032 HE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR STONE DEAD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING LIKE THE IDIOT I WAS FAST BECOMING
302-123516-0033 NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
302-123516-0034 BACK INTO MY CORNER I CROUCHED
302-123516-0035 AND STEALTHILY ON CAME THE AWFUL EYES UNTIL THEY REACHED THE DEAD BODY AT MY FEET THEN SLOWLY THEY RETREATED BUT THIS TIME WITH A STRANGE GRATING SOUND
302-123523-0000 THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
302-123523-0001 WHICH I NEGOTIATED EASILY WITHOUT ASSISTANCE ONCE INSIDE HOWEVER THE GATE GAVE ME CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE
302-123523-0002 AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS
302-123523-0003 THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
302-123523-0004 AND SO I CAME CLOSE AND PEERED WITHIN AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS SAT THAN KOSIS AND HIS CONSORT
302-123523-0005 SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
302-123523-0006 THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
302-123523-0007 AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE THESE TWO PARTIES SEPARATED AND HALTED FACING EACH OTHER AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE THEN CAME MORE DIGNITARIES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE PALACE AND OF THE ARMY AND FINALLY
302-123523-0008 TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
302-123523-0009 THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
302-123523-0010 FOR IT WAS SAB THAN PRINCE OF ZODANGA WHO STOOD REVEALED BEFORE ME THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS AND PLACED ONE OF THE COLLARS OF GOLD ABOUT HIS SON'S NECK
302-123523-0011 SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
302-123523-0012 BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
302-123523-0013 I BROUGHT MY LONG SWORD DOWN UPON THE GOLDEN CHAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BOUND DEJAH THORIS TO ANOTHER IN AN INSTANT ALL WAS CONFUSION A THOUSAND DRAWN SWORDS MENACED ME FROM EVERY QUARTER
302-123523-0014 RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0015 WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
302-123523-0016 BUT AS HE RAISED HIS HAND TO STRIKE DEJAH THORIS SPRANG BEFORE HIM AND THEN MY SWORD FOUND THE SPOT THAT MADE SAB THAN JEDDAK OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0017 AND AGAIN WE FACED EACH OTHER HE WAS SOON JOINED BY A QUARTET OF OFFICERS AND WITH MY BACK AGAINST A GOLDEN THRONE I FOUGHT ONCE AGAIN FOR DEJAH THORIS I WAS HARD PRESSED TO DEFEND MYSELF
302-123523-0018 AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN
302-123523-0019 WHEN SEVERAL MORE RUSHED TO THE AID OF THEIR NEW RULER AND TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE OLD AS THEY ADVANCED THERE WERE CRIES OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN STRIKE HER DOWN IT IS HER PLOT KILL HER KILL HER
302-123523-0020 CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
302-123523-0021 THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
302-123523-0022 WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET
302-123523-0023 NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
302-123523-0024 AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
302-123523-0025 AND LEAVING DEJAH THORIS IN CHARGE OF TARS TARKAS I TOOK A DOZEN WARRIORS AND HASTENED TO THE DUNGEONS BENEATH THE PALACE THE JAILERS HAD ALL LEFT TO JOIN THE FIGHTERS IN THE THRONE ROOM SO WE SEARCHED THE LABYRINTHINE PRISON WITHOUT OPPOSITION
302-123523-0026 I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
302-123523-0027 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
302-123523-0028 SO THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN SEEN SAB THAN WE DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO ATTEMPT TO CUT AWAY THE BARS AND CHAINS WHICH HELD HIM PRISONER SO AT HIS SUGGESTION
302-123523-0029 FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
302-123523-0030 AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
302-123523-0031 CAN IT BE THAT ALL EARTH MEN ARE AS YOU ALONE A STRANGER HUNTED THREATENED PERSECUTED YOU HAVE DONE IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS WHAT IN ALL THE PAST AGES OF BARSOOM NO MAN HAS EVER DONE
302-123523-0032 JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
302-123523-0033 LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
302-123523-0034 FOR I AM FREE AND MORE STILL I HAVE TO SAY ERE IT IS AGAIN TOO LATE I RETURNED I HAVE DONE MANY STRANGE THINGS IN MY LIFE MANY THINGS THAT WISER MEN WOULD NOT HAVE DARED
302-123523-0035 BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF FOR NEVER HAD I DREAMED THAT IN ALL THE UNIVERSE DWELT SUCH A WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM
302-123523-0036 BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME DOUBT MY SANITY AS I ASK YOU MY PRINCESS TO BE MINE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ABASHED WHO SO WELL KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS PLEA
302-123523-0037 BEFORE THE PLEA WERE MADE SHE REPLIED RISING AND PLACING HER DEAR HANDS UPON MY SHOULDERS AND SO I TOOK HER IN MY ARMS AND KISSED HER AND THUS IN THE MIDST OF A CITY OF WILD CONFLICT FILLED WITH THE ALARMS OF WAR
302-123523-0038 WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
307-127535-0000 THE COUNCIL OF BUCCANEERS HAD LASTED SOME TIME WHEN ONE OF THEM RE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND WITH A REPETITION OF THE SAME SALUTE WHICH HAD IN MY EYES AN IRONICAL AIR BEGGED FOR A MOMENT'S LOAN OF THE TORCH SILVER BRIEFLY AGREED
307-127535-0001 AND THIS EMISSARY RETIRED AGAIN LEAVING US TOGETHER IN THE DARK THERE'S A BREEZE COMING JIM SAID SILVER WHO HAD BY THIS TIME ADOPTED QUITE A FRIENDLY AND FAMILIAR TONE I TURNED TO THE LOOPHOLE NEAREST ME AND LOOKED OUT
307-127535-0002 THE EMBERS OF THE GREAT FIRE HAD SO FAR BURNED THEMSELVES OUT AND NOW GLOWED SO LOW AND DUSKILY THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHY THESE CONSPIRATORS DESIRED A TORCH ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE SLOPE TO THE STOCKADE THEY WERE COLLECTED IN A GROUP
307-127535-0003 ONE HELD THE LIGHT ANOTHER WAS ON HIS KNEES IN THEIR MIDST AND I SAW THE BLADE OF AN OPEN KNIFE SHINE IN HIS HAND WITH VARYING COLOURS IN THE MOON AND TORCHLIGHT
307-127535-0004 I COULD JUST MAKE OUT THAT HE HAD A BOOK AS WELL AS A KNIFE IN HIS HAND AND WAS STILL WONDERING HOW ANYTHING SO INCONGRUOUS HAD COME IN THEIR POSSESSION WHEN THE KNEELING FIGURE ROSE ONCE MORE TO HIS FEET
307-127535-0005 AND THE WHOLE PARTY BEGAN TO MOVE TOGETHER TOWARDS THE HOUSE HERE THEY COME SAID I AND I RETURNED TO MY FORMER POSITION FOR IT SEEMED BENEATH MY DIGNITY THAT THEY SHOULD FIND ME WATCHING THEM WELL LET EM COME LAD LET EM COME
307-127535-0006 I'VE STILL A SHOT IN MY LOCKER THE DOOR OPENED AND THE FIVE MEN STANDING HUDDLED TOGETHER JUST INSIDE PUSHED ONE OF THEIR NUMBER FORWARD IN ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COMICAL TO SEE HIS SLOW ADVANCE

307-127535-0030 BUT THAT'S A TRIFLE YOU LOOK THERE THAT'S WHY AND HE CAST DOWN UPON THE FLOOR A PAPER THAT I INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED NONE OTHER THAN THE CHART ON YELLOW PAPER
307-127535-0031 THE APPEARANCE OF THE CHART WAS INCREDIBLE TO THE SURVIVING MUTINEERS THEY LEAPED UPON IT LIKE CATS UPON A MOUSE IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND ONE TEARING IT FROM ANOTHER AND BY THE OATHS AND THE CRIES AND THE CHILDISH LAUGHTER WITH WHICH THEY ACCOMPANIED THEIR EXAMINATION
307-127535-0032 BUT WERE AT SEA WITH IT BESIDES IN SAFETY YES SAID ONE THAT'S FLINT SURE ENOUGH J F AND A SCORE BELOW WITH A CLOVE HITCH TO IT SO HE DONE EVER

307-127535-0039 DON'T IT THOUGH CRIED DICK WITH A SORT OF JOY WELL I RECKON THAT'S WORTH HAVING TOO HERE JIM HERE'S A CUR'OSITY FOR YOU SAID SILVER AND HE TOSSED ME THE PAPER
307-127535-0040 ONE SIDE WAS BLANK FOR IT HAD BEEN THE LAST LEAF THE OTHER CONTAINED A VERSE OR TWO OF REVELATION THESE WORDS AMONG THE REST WHICH STRUCK SHARPLY HOME UPON MY MIND WITHOUT ARE DOGS AND MURDERERS
307-127535-0041 THE PRINTED SIDE HAD BEEN BLACKENED WITH WOOD ASH WHICH ALREADY BEGAN TO COME OFF AND SOIL MY FINGERS ON THE BLANK SIDE HAD BEEN WRITTEN WITH THE SAME MATERIAL THE ONE WORD DEPPOSED
307-127535-0042 I HAVE THAT CURIOSITY BESIDE ME AT THIS MOMENT BUT NOT A TRACE OF WRITING NOW REMAINS BEYOND A SINGLE SCRATCH SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT MAKE WITH HIS THUMB NAIL THAT WAS THE END OF THE NIGHT'S BUSINESS
307-127535-0043 IT WAS LONG ERE I COULD CLOSE AN EYE AND HEAVEN KNOWS I HAD MATTER ENOUGH FOR THOUGHT IN THE MAN WHOM I HAD SLAIN THAT AFTERNOON
307-127535-0044 AND ABOVE ALL IN THE REMARKABLE GAME THAT I SAW SILVER NOW ENGAGED UPON KEEPING THE MUTINEERS TOGETHER WITH ONE HAND AND GRASPING WITH THE OTHER AFTER EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HIS PEACE AND SAVE HIS MISERABLE LIFE
307-127535-0045 HE HIMSELF SLEPT PEACEFULLY AND SNORED ALOUD YET
307-127539-0000 THERE NEVER WAS SUCH AN OVERTURN IN THIS WORLD EACH OF THESE SIX MEN WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STRUCK
307-127539-0001 EVERY THOUGHT OF HIS SOUL HAD BEEN SET FULL STRETCH LIKE A RACER ON THAT MONEY WELL HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A SINGLE SECOND DEAD AND HE KEPT HIS HEAD FOUND HIS TEMPER AND CHANGED HIS PLAN BEFORE THE OTHERS HAD HAD TIME TO REALIZE THE DISAPPOINTMENT
307-127539-0002 HERE IS A NARROW CORNER AS
307-127539-0003 HIS LOOKS WERE NOT QUITE FRIENDLY AND I WAS SO REVOLTED AT THESE CONSTANT CHANGES THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR WHISPERING SO YOU'VE CHANGED SIDES AGAIN THERE WAS NO TIME LEFT FOR HIM TO ANSWER IN
307-127539-0004 AND TO DIG WITH THEIR FINGERS THROWING THE BOARDS ASIDE AS THEY DID SO MORGAN FOUND A PIECE OF GOLD HE HELD IT UP WITH A PERFECT SPOUT OF OATHS IT WAS A TWO GUINEA PIECE AND IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND AMONG THEM FOR A QUARTER OF A MINUTE
307-127539-0005 TWO GUINEAS ROARED MERRY SHAKING IT AT SILVER
307-127539-0006 YOU'RE HIM THAT NEVER BUNGLED NOTHING YOU WOODEN HEADED LUBBER DIG AWAY BOYS SAID SILVER WITH THE COOLEST INSOLENCE YOU'LL FIND SOME PIG NUTS AND I SHOULDN'T WONDER PIG NUTS REPEATED MERRY IN A SCREAM MATES DO YOU HEAR THAT
307-127539-0007 AH MERRY REMARKED SILVER STANDING FOR CAP'N AGAIN YOU'RE A PUSHING LAD TO BE SURE BUT THIS TIME EVERYONE WAS ENTIRELY IN MERRY'S FAVOUR THEY BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE EXCAVATION
307-127539-0008 DARTING FURIOUS GLANCES BEHIND THEM ONE THING I OBSERVED WHICH LOOKED WELL FOR US THEY ALL GOT OUT UPON THE OPPOSITE SIDE FROM SILVER WELL THERE WE STOOD TWO ON ONE SIDE FIVE ON THE OTHER THE PIT BETWEEN US
307-127539-0009 AND NOBODY SCREWED UP HIGH ENOUGH TO OFFER THE FIRST BLOW SILVER NEVER MOVED HE WATCHED THEM VERY UPRIGHT ON HIS CRUTCH AND LOOKED AS COOL AS EVER I SAW HIM HE WAS BRAVE AND NO MISTAKE
307-127539-0010 AT LAST MERRY SEEMED TO THINK A SPEECH MIGHT HELP MATTERS
307-127539-0011 ONE'S THE OLD CRIPPLE THAT BROUGHT US ALL HERE AND BLUNDERED US DOWN TO THIS THE OTHER'S THAT CUB THAT I MEAN TO HAVE THE HEART OF NOW MATES
307-127539-0012 AND PLAINLY MEANT TO LEAD A CHARGE BUT JUST THEN CRACK CRACK CRACK THREE MUSKET SHOTS FLASHED OUT OF THE THICKET MERRY TUMBLED HEAD FOREMOST INTO THE EXCAVATION
307-127539-0013 THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGE SPUN ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM AND FELL ALL HIS LENGTH UPON HIS SIDE WHERE HE LAY DEAD BUT STILL TWITCHING AND THE OTHER THREE TURNED AND RAN FOR IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
307-127539-0014 BEFORE YOU COULD WINK LONG JOHN HAD FIRED TWO BARRELS OF A PISTOL INTO THE STRUGGLING MERRY AND AS THE MAN ROLLED UP HIS EYES AT HIM IN THE LAST AGONY GEORGE SAID HE
307-127539-0015 SOMETIMES PLUNGING THROUGH THE BUSHES TO THE CHEST I TELL YOU BUT SILVER WAS ANXIOUS TO KEEP UP WITH US THE WORK THAT MAN WENT THROUGH
307-127539-0016 WAS WORK NO SOUND MAN EVER EQUALLED AND SO THINKS THE DOCTOR AS IT WAS HE WAS ALREADY THIRTY YARDS BEHIND US AND ON THE VERGE OF STRANGLING WHEN WE REACHED THE BROW OF THE SLOPE DOCTOR HE HAILED SEE THERE
307-127539-0017 NO HURRY SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS NO HURRY IN A MORE OPEN PART OF THE PLATEAU WE COULD SEE THE THREE SURVIVORS STILL RUNNING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THEY HAD STARTED
307-127539-0018 WE WERE ALREADY BETWEEN THEM AND THE BOATS
307-127539-0019 CAME SLOWLY UP WITH US THANK YE KINDLY DOCTOR SAYS HE YOU CAME IN IN ABOUT THE NICK I GUESS FOR ME AND HAWKINS
307-127539-0020 I'M BEN GUNN I AM REPLIED THE MAROON WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL IN HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND HE ADDED AFTER A LONG PAUSE HOW DO MISTER SILVER PRETTY WELL I THANK YE SAYS YOU
307-127539-0021 BEN BEN MURMURED SILVER TO THINK AS YOU'VE DONE ME THE DOCTOR SENT BACK GRAY FOR ONE OF THE PICK AXES DESERTED IN THEIR FLIGHT BY THE MUTINEERS
307-127539-0022 BEN IN HIS LONG LONELY WANDERINGS ABOUT THE ISLAND HAD FOUND THE SKELETON IT WAS HE THAT HAD RIFLED IT HE HAD FOUND THE TREASURE HE HAD DUG IT UP IT WAS THE HAFT OF HIS PICK AXE THAT LAY BROKEN IN THE EXCAVATION
307-127539-0023 HE HAD CARRIED IT ON HIS BACK IN MANY WEARY JOURNEYS FROM THE FOOT OF THE TALL PINE TO A CAVE HE HAD ON THE TWO POINTED HILL AT THE NORTH EAST ANGLE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IT HAD LAIN STORED IN SAFETY SINCE TWO MONTHS
307-127539-0024 GIVEN HIM THE STORES FOR BEN GUNN'S CAVE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH GOATS MEAT SALTED BY HIMSELF GIVEN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO GET A CHANCE OF MOVING IN SAFETY FROM THE STOCKADE TO THE TWO POINTED HILL THERE TO BE CLEAR OF MALARIA
307-127539-0025 AND KEEP A GUARD UPON THE MONEY AS FOR YOU JIM HE SAID IT WENT AGAINST MY HEART
307-127539-0026 AND LEAVING THE SQUIRE TO GUARD THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN GRAY AND THE MAROON AND STARTED MAKING THE DIAGONAL ACROSS THE ISLAND TO BE AT HAND BESIDE THE PINE SOON HOWEVER HE SAW THAT OUR PARTY HAD THE START OF HIM AND BEN GUNN BEING FLEET OF FOOT
307-127539-0027 HAD BEEN DISPATCHED IN FRONT TO DO HIS BEST ALONE THEN IT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORK UPON THE SUPERSTITIONS OF HIS FORMER SHIPMATES
307-127539-0028 NOT A THOUGHT REPLIED DOCTOR LIVESEY CHEERILY AND BY THIS TIME WE HAD REACHED THE GIGS
307-127539-0029 THIS WAS A RUN OF EIGHT OR NINE MILES SILVER THOUGH HE WAS ALMOST KILLED ALREADY WITH FATIGUE WAS SET TO AN OAR LIKE THE REST OF US AND WE WERE SOON SKIMMING SWIFTLY OVER A SMOOTH SEA
307-127539-0030 AND A FIGURE STANDING BY IT LEANING ON A MUSKET IT WAS THE SQUIRE AND WE WAVED A HANDKERCHIEF AND GAVE HIM THREE CHEERS IN WHICH THE VOICE OF SILVER JOINED AS HEARTILY AS ANY THREE MILES FARTHER JUST INSIDE THE MOUTH OF NORTH INLET
307-127539-0031 WHAT SHOULD WE MEET BUT THE HISPANIOLA CRUISING BY HERSELF THE LAST FLOOD HAD LIFTED HER AND HAD THERE BEEN MUCH WIND OR A STRONG TIDE CURRENT AS IN THE SOUTHERN ANCHORAGE WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND HER MORE OR FOUND HER STRANDED BEYOND HELP
307-127539-0032 ANOTHER ANCHOR WAS GOT READY AND DROPPED IN A FATHOM AND A HALF OF WATER WE ALL PULLED ROUND AGAIN TO RUM COVE THE NEAREST POINT FOR BEN GUNN'S TREASURE HOUSE AND THEN GRAY SINGLE HANDED RETURNED WITH THE GIG TO THE HISPANIOLA
307-127539-0033 WHERE HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT ON GUARD A GENTLE SLOPE RAN UP FROM THE BEACH TO THE ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE AT THE TOP THE SQUIRE MET US
307-127539-0034 TO ME HE WAS CORDIAL AND KIND SAYING NOTHING OF MY ESCAPADE EITHER IN THE WAY OF BLAME OR PRAISE AT SILVER'S POLITE SALUTE HE SOMEWHAT FLUSHED JOHN SILVER
307-127539-0035 REPLIED LONG JOHN AGAIN SALUTING I DARE YOU TO THANK ME CRIED THE SQUIRE IT IS A GROSS DERELICTION OF MY DUTY STAND BACK AND THEREUPON WE ALL ENTERED THE CAVE
307-127539-0036 IT WAS A LARGE AIRY PLACE WITH A LITTLE SPRING AND A POOL OF CLEAR WATER OVERHUNG WITH FERNS THE FLOOR WAS SAND BEFORE A BIG FIRE LAY CAPTAIN SMOLLETT AND IN A FAR CORNER ONLY DUSKILY FLICKERED OVER BY THE BLAZE
307-127539-0037 I BEHELD GREAT HEAPS OF COIN AND QUADRILATERALS BUILT OF BARS OF GOLD THAT WAS FLINT'S TREASURE THAT WE HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK AND THAT HAD COST ALREADY THE LIVES OF SEVENTEEN MEN FROM THE HISPANIOLA
307-127539-0038 HOW MANY IT HAD COST IN THE AMASSING WHAT BLOOD AND SORROW WHAT GOOD SHIPS SCUTTLED ON THE DEEP WHAT BRAVE MEN WALKING THE PLANK BLINDFOLD WHAT SHOT OF CANNON WHAT SHAME AND LIES AND CRUELTY
307-127539-0039 PERHAPS NO MAN ALIVE COULD TELL YET THERE WERE STILL THREE UPON THAT ISLAND SILVER AND OLD MORGAN AND BEN GUNN WHO HAD EACH TAKEN HIS SHARE IN THESE CRIMES AS EACH HAD HOPED IN VAIN TO SHARE IN THE REWARD
307-127539-0040 COME IN JIM SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU'RE A GOOD BOY IN YOUR LINE JIM BUT I DON'T THINK YOU AND ME'LL GO TO SEA AGAIN YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF THE BORN FAVOURITE FOR ME
307-127539-0041 AND WHAT A MEAL IT WAS WITH BEN GUNN'S SALTED GOAT AND SOME DELICACIES AND A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE FROM THE HISPANIOLA NEVER I AM SURE WERE PEOPLE GAYER OR HAPPIER
307-127540-0000 THE THREE FELLOWS STILL ABROAD UPON THE ISLAND DID NOT GREATLY TROUBLE US A SINGLE SENTRY ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WAS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE US AGAINST ANY SUDDEN ONSLAUGHT AND WE THOUGHT BESIDES THEY HAD HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH OF FIGHTING
307-127540-0001 THEREFORE THE WORK WAS PUSHED ON BRISKLY GRAY AND BEN GUNN CAME AND WENT WITH THE BOAT WHILE THE REST DURING THEIR ABSENCES
307-127540-0002 TWO OF THE BARS SLUNG IN A ROPE'S END MADE A GOOD LOAD FOR A GROWN MAN ONE THAT HE WAS GLAD TO WALK SLOWLY WITH FOR MY PART
307-127540-0003 THE PICTURES OF ALL THE KINGS OF EUROPE FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS STRANGE ORIENTAL PIECES STAMPED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE WISPS OF STRING OR BITS OF SPIDER'S WEB
307-127540-0004 NEARLY EVERY VARIETY OF MONEY IN THE WORLD MUST I THINK HAVE FOUND A PLACE IN THAT COLLECTION AND FOR NUMBER I AM SURE THEY WERE LIKE AUTUMN LEAVES SO THAT MY BACK ACHED WITH STOOPING AND MY FINGERS WITH SORTING THEM OUT
307-127540-0005 AT LAST I THINK IT WAS ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE DOCTOR AND I WERE STROLLING ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WHERE IT OVERLOOKS THE LOWLANDS OF THE ISLE
307-127540-0006 THE WIND BROUGHT US A NOISE BETWEEN SHRIEKING AND SINGING IT WAS ONLY A SNATCH THAT REACHED OUR EARS FOLLOWED BY THE FORMER SILENCE HEAVEN FORGIVE THEM SAID THE DOCTOR TIS THE MUTINEERS
307-127540-0007 ALL DRUNK SIR STRUCK IN THE VOICE OF SILVER FROM BEHIND US SILVER I SHOULD SAY WAS ALLOWED HIS ENTIRE LIBERTY AND IN SPITE OF DAILY REBUFFS SEEMED TO REGARD HIMSELF ONCE MORE AS QUITE A PRIVILEGED AND FRIENDLY DEPENDENT
307-127540-0008 INDEED IT WAS REMARKABLE HOW WELL HE BORE THESE SLIGHTS AND WITH WHAT UNWEARYING POLITENESS HE KEPT ON TRYING TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH ALL YET I THINK NONE TREATED HIM BETTER THAN A DOG UNLESS IT WAS BEN GUNN
307-127540-0009 WHO WAS STILL TERRIBLY AFRAID OF HIS OLD QUARTERMASTER OR MYSELF WHO HAD REALLY SOMETHING TO THANK HIM FOR ALTHOUGH FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE I HAD REASON TO THINK EVEN WORSE OF HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE
307-127540-0010 FOR I HAD SEEN HIM MEDITATING A FRESH TREACHERY UPON THE PLATEAU ACCORDINGLY IT WAS PRETTY GRUFFLY THAT THE DOCTOR ANSWERED HIM DRUNK OR RAVING SAID HE RIGHT YOU WERE SIR REPLIED SILVER
307-127540-0011 AND PRECIOUS LITTLE ODDS WHICH TO YOU AND ME I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD HARDLY ASK ME TO CALL YOU A HUMANE MAN RETURNED THE DOCTOR WITH A SNEER AND SO MY FEELINGS MAY SURPRISE YOU MASTER SILVER
307-127540-0012 BUT IF I WERE SURE THEY WERE RAVING AS I AM MORALLY CERTAIN ONE AT LEAST OF THEM IS DOWN WITH FEVER I SHOULD LEAVE THIS CAMP AND AT WHATEVER RISK TO MY OWN CARCASS TAKE THEM THE ASSISTANCE OF MY SKILL
307-127540-0013 NO SAID THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE MAN TO KEEP YOUR WORD WE KNOW THAT WELL THAT WAS ABOUT THE LAST NEWS WE HAD OF THE THREE PIRATES ONLY ONCE WE HEARD A GUNSHOT A GREAT WAY OFF AND SUPPOSED THEM TO BE HUNTING
307-127540-0014 A COUNCIL WAS HELD AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE MUST DESERT THEM ON THE ISLAND TO THE HUGE GLEE I MUST SAY OF BEN GUNN AND WITH THE STRONG APPROVAL OF GRAY WE LEFT A GOOD STOCK OF POWDER AND SHOT THE BULK OF THE SALT GOAT
307-127540-0015 A FEW MEDICINES AND SOME OTHER NECESSARIES TOOLS CLOTHING A SPARE SAIL A FATHOM OR TWO OF ROPE AND BY THE PARTICULAR DESIRE OF THE DOCTOR A HANDSOME PRESENT OF TOBACCO THAT WAS ABOUT OUR LAST DOING ON THE ISLAND
307-127540-0016 AND THERE WE SAW ALL THREE OF THEM KNEELING TOGETHER ON A SPIT OF SAND WITH THEIR ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION IT WENT TO ALL OUR HEARTS I THINK TO LEAVE THEM IN THAT WRETCHED STATE BUT WE COULD NOT RISK ANOTHER MUTINY
307-127540-0017 AND TO TAKE THEM HOME FOR THE GIBBET WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRUEL SORT OF KINDNESS THE DOCTOR HAILED THEM AND TOLD THEM OF THE STORES WE HAD LEFT AND WHERE THEY WERE TO FIND THEM BUT THEY CONTINUED TO CALL US BY NAME AND APPEAL TO US FOR GOD'S SAKE
307-127540-0018 LEAPT TO HIS FEET WITH A HOARSE CRY WHIPPED HIS MUSKET TO HIS SHOULDER AND SENT A SHOT WHISTLING OVER SILVER'S HEAD
307-127540-0019 AFTER THAT WE KEPT UNDER COVER OF THE BULWARKS AND WHEN NEXT I LOOKED OUT THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE SPIT AND THE SPIT ITSELF HAD ALMOST MELTED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE GROWING DISTANCE THAT WAS AT LEAST THE END OF THAT
307-127540-0020 AND BEFORE NOON TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE JOY THE HIGHEST ROCK OF TREASURE ISLAND HAD SUNK INTO THE BLUE ROUND OF SEA WE WERE SO SHORT OF MEN THAT EVERYONE ON BOARD HAD TO BEAR A HAND
307-127540-0021 ONLY THE CAPTAIN LYING ON A MATTRESS IN THE STERN AND GIVING HIS ORDERS FOR THOUGH GREATLY RECOVERED HE WAS STILL IN WANT OF QUIET WE LAID HER HEAD FOR THE NEAREST PORT IN SPANISH AMERICA FOR WE COULD NOT RISK THE VOYAGE HOME WITHOUT FRESH HANDS
307-127540-0022 AND AS IT WAS WHAT WITH BAFFLING WINDS AND A COUPLE OF FRESH GALES WE WERE ALL WORN OUT BEFORE WE REACHED IT IT WAS JUST AT SUNDOWN WHEN WE CAST ANCHOR IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND LOCKED GULF
307-127540-0023 THE TASTE OF THE TROPICAL FRUITS AND ABOVE ALL THE LIGHTS THAT BEGAN TO SHINE IN THE TOWN MADE A MOST CHARMING CONTRAST TO OUR DARK AND BLOODY SOJOURN ON THE ISLAND AND THE DOCTOR AND THE SQUIRE TAKING ME ALONG WITH THEM WENT ASHORE
307-127540-0024 TO PASS THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT HERE THEY MET THE CAPTAIN OF AN ENGLISH MAN OF WAR FELL IN TALK WITH HIM WENT ON BOARD HIS SHIP AND IN SHORT HAD SO AGREEABLE A TIME THAT DAY WAS BREAKING WHEN WE CAME ALONGSIDE THE HISPANIOLA
307-127540-0025 SILVER WAS GONE THE MAROON HAD CONNIVED AT HIS ESCAPE IN A SHORE BOAT SOME HOURS AGO
307-127540-0026 THAT MAN WITH THE ONE LEG HAD STAYED ABOARD BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THE SEA COOK HAD NOT GONE EMPTY HANDED HE HAD CUT THROUGH A BULKHEAD UNOBSERVED AND HAD REMOVED ONE OF THE SACKS OF COIN
307-127540-0027 WORTH PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED GUINEAS TO HELP HIM ON HIS FURTHER WANDERINGS I THINK WE WERE ALL PLEASED TO BE SO CHEAPLY QUIT OF HIM
307-127540-0028 WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WE GOT A FEW HANDS ON BOARD MADE A GOOD CRUISE HOME AND THE HISPANIOLA REACHED BRISTOL JUST AS MISTER BLANDLY WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF FITTING OUT HER CONSORT FIVE MEN ONLY OF THOSE WHO HAD SAILED RETURNED WITH HER
307-127540-0029 AS THAT OTHER SHIP THEY SANG ABOUT WITH ONE MAN OF HER CREW ALIVE WHAT PUT TO SEA WITH SEVENTY FIVE ALL OF US HAD AN AMPLE SHARE OF THE TREASURE AND USED IT WISELY OR FOOLISHLY ACCORDING TO OUR NATURES
307-127540-0030 CAPTAIN SMOLLETT IS NOW RETIRED FROM THE SEA GRAY NOT ONLY SAVED HIS MONEY BUT BEING SUDDENLY SMIT WITH THE DESIRE TO RISE ALSO STUDIED HIS PROFESSION AND HE IS NOW MATE AND PART OWNER OF A FINE FULL RIGGED SHIP
307-127540-0031 MARRIED BESIDES AND THE FATHER OF A FAMILY AS FOR BEN GUNN HE GOT A THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE SPENT OR LOST IN THREE WEEKS OR TO BE MORE EXACT IN NINETEEN DAYS FOR HE WAS BACK BEGGING ON THE TWENTIETH
307-127540-0032 OF SILVER WE HAVE HEARD NO MORE THAT FORMIDABLE SEAFARING MAN WITH ONE LEG HAS AT LAST GONE CLEAN OUT OF MY LIFE
307-127540-0033 AND PERHAPS STILL LIVES IN COMFORT WITH HER AND CAPTAIN FLINT IT IS TO BE HOPED SO I SUPPOSE FOR HIS CHANCES OF COMFORT IN ANOTHER WORLD ARE VERY SMALL THE BAR SILVER
307-127540-0034 AND THE ARMS STILL LIE FOR ALL THAT I KNOW WHERE FLINT BURIED THEM AND CERTAINLY THEY SHALL LIE THERE FOR ME
307-127540-0035 AND THE WORST DREAMS THAT EVER I HAVE ARE WHEN I HEAR THE SURF BOOMING ABOUT ITS COASTS OR START UPRIGHT IN BED WITH THE SHARP VOICE OF CAPTAIN FLINT STILL RINGING IN MY EARS
