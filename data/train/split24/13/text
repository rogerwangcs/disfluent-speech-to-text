446-123501-0000 CHAPTER THREE MY ADVENT ON MARS I OPENED MY EYES UPON A STRANGE AND WEIRD LANDSCAPE I KNEW THAT I WAS ON MARS NOT ONCE DID I QUESTION EITHER MY SANITY OR MY WAKEFULNESS
446-123501-0001 I WAS NOT ASLEEP NO NEED FOR PINCHING HERE MY INNER CONSCIOUSNESS TOLD ME AS PLAINLY THAT I WAS UPON MARS AS YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE UPON EARTH YOU DO NOT QUESTION THE FACT
446-123501-0002 NEITHER DID I I FOUND MYSELF LYING PRONE UPON A BED OF YELLOWISH MOSSLIKE VEGETATION WHICH STRETCHED AROUND ME IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR INTERMINABLE MILES I SEEMED TO BE LYING IN A DEEP
446-123501-0003 THE IRREGULARITIES OF LOW HILLS IT WAS MIDDAY THE SUN WAS SHINING FULL UPON ME AND THE HEAT OF IT WAS RATHER INTENSE UPON MY NAKED BODY YET NO GREATER
446-123501-0004 THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS ON AN ARIZONA DESERT HERE AND THERE WERE SLIGHT OUTCROPPINGS OF QUARTZ BEARING ROCK WHICH GLISTENED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE TO MY LEFT PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS APPEARED A LOW WALLED ENCLOSURE
446-123501-0005 ABOUT FOUR FEET IN HEIGHT NO WATER AND NO OTHER VEGETATION THAN THE MOSS WAS IN EVIDENCE AND AS I WAS SOMEWHAT THIRSTY I DETERMINED TO DO A LITTLE EXPLORING SPRINGING TO MY FEET I RECEIVED MY FIRST MARTIAN SURPRISE
446-123501-0006 FOR THE EFFORT WHICH ON EARTH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME STANDING UPRIGHT CARRIED ME INTO THE MARTIAN AIR TO THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE YARDS I ALIGHTED SOFTLY UPON THE GROUND HOWEVER WITHOUT APPRECIABLE SHOCK OR JAR
446-123501-0007 NOW COMMENCED A SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS WHICH EVEN THEN SEEMED LUDICROUS IN THE EXTREME I FOUND THAT I MUST LEARN TO WALK ALL OVER AGAIN
446-123501-0008 AS THE MUSCULAR EXERTION WHICH CARRIED ME EASILY AND SAFELY UPON EARTH PLAYED STRANGE ANTICS WITH ME UPON MARS INSTEAD OF PROGRESSING IN A SANE AND DIGNIFIED MANNER
446-123501-0009 MY ATTEMPTS TO WALK RESULTED IN A VARIETY OF HOPS WHICH TOOK ME CLEAR OF THE GROUND A COUPLE OF FEET AT EACH STEP AND LANDED ME SPRAWLING UPON MY FACE OR BACK
446-123501-0010 MY MUSCLES PERFECTLY ATTUNED AND ACCUSTOMED TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ON EARTH PLAYED THE MISCHIEF WITH ME IN ATTEMPTING FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COPE WITH THE LESSER GRAVITATION AND LOWER AIR PRESSURE ON MARS
446-123501-0011 I WAS DETERMINED HOWEVER TO EXPLORE THE LOW STRUCTURE WHICH WAS THE ONLY EVIDENCE OF HABITATION IN SIGHT
446-123501-0012 IT HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN ME TO SEE THE ROOF OF THE ENCLOSURE WAS OF SOLID GLASS
446-123501-0013 AND BENEATH THIS WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED LARGE EGGS PERFECTLY ROUND AND SNOWY WHITE THE EGGS WERE NEARLY UNIFORM IN SIZE BEING ABOUT TWO AND ONE HALF FEET IN DIAMETER FIVE OR SIX HAD ALREADY HATCHED
446-123501-0014 AND THE GROTESQUE CARICATURES WHICH SAT BLINKING IN THE SUNLIGHT WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE ME TO DOUBT MY SANITY THEY SEEMED MOSTLY HEAD WITH LITTLE SCRAWNY BODIES LONG NECKS AND SIX LEGS OR
446-123501-0015 AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED TWO LEGS AND TWO ARMS WITH AN INTERMEDIARY PAIR OF LIMBS WHICH COULD BE USED AT WILL EITHER AS ARMS OR LEGS THEIR EYES WERE SET AT THE EXTREME SIDES OF THEIR HEADS A TRIFLE ABOVE THE CENTER
446-123501-0016 WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TURNING THE HEAD THE EARS WHICH WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE EYES AND CLOSER TOGETHER WERE SMALL CUP SHAPED ANTENNAE PROTRUDING NOT MORE THAN AN INCH ON THESE YOUNG SPECIMENS
446-123501-0017 THEIR NOSES WERE BUT LONGITUDINAL SLITS IN THE CENTER OF THEIR FACES MIDWAY BETWEEN THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS THERE WAS NO HAIR ON THEIR BODIES
446-123501-0018 THESE LATTER ADD A MOST FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE TO AN OTHERWISE FEARSOME AND TERRIBLE COUNTENANCE AS THE LOWER TUSKS CURVE UPWARD TO SHARP POINTS WHICH END ABOUT WHERE THE EYES OF EARTHLY HUMAN BEINGS ARE LOCATED
446-123501-0019 THE WHITENESS OF THE TEETH IS NOT THAT OF IVORY BUT OF THE SNOWIEST AND MOST GLEAMING OF CHINA AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF THEIR OLIVE SKINS THEIR TUSKS STAND OUT IN A MOST STRIKING MANNER
446-123501-0020 MAKING THESE WEAPONS PRESENT A SINGULARLY FORMIDABLE APPEARANCE MOST OF THESE DETAILS I NOTED LATER FOR I WAS GIVEN BUT LITTLE TIME TO SPECULATE ON THE WONDERS OF MY NEW DISCOVERY
446-123501-0021 ON SUCH A LITTLE THING MY LIFE HUNG THAT I OFTEN MARVEL THAT I ESCAPED SO EASILY HAD NOT THE RIFLE OF THE LEADER OF THE PARTY SWUNG FROM ITS FASTENINGS BESIDE HIS SADDLE IN SUCH A WAY
446-123501-0022 AS TO STRIKE AGAINST THE BUTT OF HIS GREAT METAL SHOD SPEAR I SHOULD HAVE SNUFFED OUT WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT DEATH WAS NEAR ME BUT THE LITTLE SOUND CAUSED ME TO TURN
446-123501-0023 AND THERE UPON ME NOT TEN FEET FROM MY BREAST WAS THE POINT OF THAT HUGE SPEAR A SPEAR FORTY FEET LONG TIPPED WITH GLEAMING METAL AND HELD LOW AT THE SIDE OF A MOUNTED REPLICA
446-123501-0024 OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
446-123501-0025 WAS FULLY FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT
446-123501-0026 HE SAT HIS MOUNT AS WE SIT A HORSE GRASPING THE ANIMAL'S BARREL WITH HIS LOWER LIMBS WHILE THE HANDS OF HIS TWO RIGHT ARMS HELD HIS IMMENSE SPEAR LOW AT THE SIDE OF HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0027 HIS TWO LEFT ARMS WERE OUTSTRETCHED LATERALLY TO HELP PRESERVE HIS BALANCE THE THING HE RODE HAVING NEITHER BRIDLE OR REINS OF ANY DESCRIPTION FOR GUIDANCE AND HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0028 HOW CAN EARTHLY WORDS DESCRIBE IT IT TOWERED TEN FEET AT THE SHOULDER HAD FOUR LEGS ON EITHER SIDE A BROAD FLAT TAIL LARGER AT THE TIP THAN AT THE ROOT AND WHICH IT HELD
446-123501-0029 STRAIGHT OUT BEHIND WHILE RUNNING A GAPING MOUTH WHICH SPLIT ITS HEAD FROM ITS SNOUT TO ITS LONG MASSIVE NECK LIKE ITS MASTER IT WAS ENTIRELY DEVOID OF HAIR
446-123501-0030 ITS BELLY WAS WHITE AND ITS LEGS SHADED FROM THE SLATE OF ITS SHOULDERS AND HIPS TO A VIVID YELLOW AT THE FEET THE FEET THEMSELVES WERE HEAVILY PADDED AND NAILLESS
446-123501-0031 WHICH FACT HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NOISELESSNESS OF THEIR APPROACH AND IN COMMON WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF LEGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE FAUNA OF MARS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN
446-123501-0032 AND ONE OTHER ANIMAL THE ONLY MAMMAL EXISTING ON MARS ALONE HAVE WELL FORMED NAILS AND THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO HOOFED ANIMALS IN EXISTENCE THERE BEHIND THIS FIRST CHARGING DEMON
446-123501-0033 TRAILED NINETEEN OTHERS SIMILAR IN ALL RESPECTS BUT AS I LEARNED LATER BEARING INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES PRECISELY
446-123501-0034 AS NO TWO OF US ARE IDENTICAL ALTHOUGH WE ARE ALL CAST IN A SIMILAR MOLD THIS PICTURE OR RATHER MATERIALIZED NIGHTMARE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AT LENGTH
446-123501-0035 AS I TURNED TO MEET IT UNARMED AND NAKED AS I WAS THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF MY IMMEDIATE PROBLEM AND THAT WAS TO GET OUT OF THE VICINITY
446-123501-0036 OF THE POINT OF THE CHARGING SPEAR CONSEQUENTLY I GAVE A VERY EARTHLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SUPERHUMAN LEAP TO REACH THE TOP OF THE MARTIAN INCUBATOR FOR SUCH I HAD DETERMINED IT MUST BE
446-123501-0037 MY EFFORT WAS CROWNED WITH A SUCCESS WHICH APPALLED ME NO LESS THAN IT SEEMED TO SURPRISE THE MARTIAN WARRIORS FOR IT CARRIED ME FULLY THIRTY FEET INTO THE AIR AND LANDED ME A HUNDRED FEET
446-123501-0038 FROM MY PURSUERS AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE I ALIGHTED UPON THE SOFT MOSS EASILY AND WITHOUT MISHAP AND TURNING SAW MY ENEMIES LINED UP ALONG THE FURTHER WALL
446-123501-0039 SOME WERE SURVEYING ME WITH EXPRESSIONS WHICH I AFTERWARD DISCOVERED MARKED EXTREME ASTONISHMENT AND THE OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT I HAD NOT MOLESTED THEIR YOUNG
446-123501-0040 THEY WERE CONVERSING TOGETHER IN LOW TONES AND GESTICULATING AND POINTING TOWARD ME THEIR DISCOVERY THAT I HAD NOT HARMED THE LITTLE MARTIANS AND THAT I WAS UNARMED MUST HAVE CAUSED THEM
446-123501-0041 TO LOOK UPON ME WITH LESS FEROCITY BUT AS I WAS TO LEARN LATER THE THING WHICH WEIGHED MOST IN MY FAVOR WAS MY EXHIBITION OF HURDLING WHILE THE MARTIANS ARE IMMENSE THEIR BONES ARE VERY LARGE
446-123501-0042 AND I DOUBT THAT WERE ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY TO BE TRANSPORTED TO EARTH HE COULD LIFT HIS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE GROUND IN FACT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO MY FEAT THEN WAS AS MARVELOUS UPON MARS
446-123501-0043 AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UPON EARTH AND FROM DESIRING TO ANNIHILATE ME THEY SUDDENLY LOOKED UPON ME AS A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY TO BE CAPTURED AND EXHIBITED AMONG THEIR FELLOWS THE RESPITE
446-123501-0044 WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR THE WEIGHT OF THESE RIFLES IS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE AND WITH THE SMALL CALIBER EXPLOSIVE RADIUM PROJECTILES WHICH THEY USE AND THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE BARREL
446-123501-0045 THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE EXTREME
446-123501-0046 WHICH WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE ON EARTH THE THEORETIC EFFECTIVE RADIUS OF THIS RIFLE IS THREE HUNDRED MILES BUT THE BEST THEY CAN DO IN ACTUAL SERVICE
446-123501-0047 WHEN EQUIPPED WITH THEIR WIRELESS FINDERS AND SIGHTERS IS BUT A TRIFLE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILES THIS IS QUITE FAR ENOUGH TO IMBUE ME WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MARTIAN FIREARM
446-123501-0048 AND SOME TELEPATHIC FORCE MUST HAVE WARNED ME AGAINST AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT FROM UNDER THE MUZZLES OF TWENTY OF THESE DEATH DEALING MACHINES
446-123501-0049 WHEN THEY HAD COVERED PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED YARDS THEY HALTED AND TURNING THEIR MOUNTS TOWARD US SAT WATCHING THE WARRIOR BY THE ENCLOSURE HE WAS THE ONE WHOSE SPEAR HAD SO NEARLY TRANSFIXED ME
446-123501-0050 AND CAME AROUND THE END OF THE INCUBATOR TOWARD ME ENTIRELY UNARMED AND AS NAKED AS I EXCEPT FOR THE ORNAMENTS STRAPPED UPON HIS HEAD LIMBS AND BREAST
446-123501-0051 WHEN HE WAS WITHIN ABOUT FIFTY FEET OF ME HE UNCLASPED AN ENORMOUS METAL ARMLET AND HOLDING IT TOWARD ME IN THE OPEN PALM OF HIS HAND ADDRESSED ME IN A CLEAR RESONANT VOICE
446-123501-0052 HE THEN STOPPED AS THOUGH WAITING FOR MY REPLY PRICKING UP HIS ANTENNAE LIKE EARS AND COCKING HIS STRANGE LOOKING EYES STILL FURTHER TOWARD ME AS THE SILENCE BECAME PAINFUL
446-123501-0053 I CONCLUDED TO HAZARD A LITTLE CONVERSATION ON MY OWN PART AS I HAD GUESSED THAT HE WAS MAKING OVERTURES OF PEACE THE THROWING DOWN OF HIS WEAPONS AND THE WITHDRAWING OF HIS TROOP BEFORE HIS ADVANCE TOWARD ME
446-123501-0054 SO WHY NOT THEN ON MARS PLACING MY HAND OVER MY HEART I BOWED LOW TO THE MARTIAN AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHILE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE
446-123501-0055 HIS ACTIONS SPOKE FOR THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE MOST DEAR TO MY HEART OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BABBLING BROOK FOR ALL THE INTELLIGENCE MY SPEECH CARRIED TO HIM
446-123501-0056 BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THE ACTION WITH WHICH I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED MY WORDS STRETCHING MY HAND TOWARD HIM I ADVANCED AND TOOK THE ARMLET FROM HIS OPEN PALM CLASPING IT ABOUT MY ARM ABOVE THE ELBOW
446-123501-0057 SMILED AT HIM AND STOOD WAITING HIS WIDE MOUTH SPREAD INTO AN ANSWERING SMILE AND LOCKING ONE OF HIS INTERMEDIARY ARMS IN MINE WE TURNED AND WALKED BACK TOWARD HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0058 AT THE SAME TIME HE MOTIONED HIS FOLLOWERS TO ADVANCE THEY STARTED TOWARD US ON A WILD RUN
446-123501-0059 EVIDENTLY HE FEARED THAT WERE I TO BE REALLY FRIGHTENED AGAIN I MIGHT JUMP ENTIRELY OUT OF THE LANDSCAPE HE EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS WITH HIS MEN MOTIONED TO ME THAT I WOULD RIDE BEHIND ONE OF THEM AND THEN MOUNTED HIS OWN ANIMAL
446-123501-0060 THE FELLOW DESIGNATED REACHED DOWN TWO OR THREE HANDS AND LIFTED ME UP BEHIND HIM ON THE GLOSSY BACK OF HIS MOUNT
446-123502-0000 CHAPTER FOUR A PRISONER WE HAD GONE PERHAPS TEN MILES WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO RISE VERY RAPIDLY WE WERE AS I WAS LATER TO LEARN NEARING THE EDGE OF ONE OF MARS LONG DEAD SEAS IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH
446-123502-0001 MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE MARTIANS HAD TAKEN PLACE IN A SHORT TIME WE GAINED THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND AFTER TRAVERSING A NARROW GORGE CAME TO AN OPEN VALLEY AT THE FAR EXTREMITY OF WHICH WAS A LOW TABLE LAND UPON WHICH I BEHELD
446-123502-0002 AN ENORMOUS CITY TOWARD THIS WE GALLOPED ENTERING IT BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A RUINED ROADWAY LEADING OUT FROM THE CITY BUT ONLY TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE LAND WHERE IT ENDED ABRUPTLY IN A FLIGHT OF BROAD STEPS
446-123502-0003 UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION I SAW AS WE PASSED THEM THAT THE BUILDINGS WERE DESERTED AND WHILE NOT GREATLY DECAYED HAD THE APPEARANCE OF NOT HAVING BEEN TENANTED FOR YEARS POSSIBLY FOR AGES
446-123502-0004 TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE CITY WAS A LARGE PLAZA AND UPON THIS AND IN THE BUILDINGS IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING IT WERE CAMPED SOME NINE OR TEN HUNDRED CREATURES OF THE SAME BREED AS MY CAPTORS
446-123502-0005 FOR SUCH I NOW CONSIDERED THEM DESPITE THE SUAVE MANNER IN WHICH I HAD BEEN TRAPPED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THEIR ORNAMENTS ALL WERE NAKED THE WOMEN VARIED IN APPEARANCE BUT LITTLE FROM THE MEN EXCEPT THAT THEIR TUSKS WERE MUCH LARGER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR HEIGHT
446-123502-0006 IN SOME INSTANCES CURVING NEARLY TO THEIR HIGH SET EARS THEIR BODIES WERE SMALLER AND LIGHTER IN COLOR AND THEIR FINGERS AND TOES BORE THE RUDIMENTS OF NAILS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY LACKING AMONG THE MALES
446-123502-0007 THE ADULT FEMALES RANGED IN HEIGHT FROM TEN TO TWELVE FEET THE CHILDREN WERE LIGHT IN COLOR EVEN LIGHTER THAN THE WOMEN AND ALL LOOKED PRECISELY ALIKE TO ME EXCEPT THAT SOME WERE TALLER
446-123502-0008 WHICH LEADS NO LIVING MARTIAN KNOWS WHITHER AND FROM WHOSE BOSOM NO MARTIAN HAS EVER RETURNED OR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE DID HE RETURN AFTER ONCE EMBARKING UPON ITS COLD DARK WATERS
446-123502-0009 ONLY ABOUT ONE MARTIAN IN A THOUSAND DIES OF SICKNESS OR DISEASE AND POSSIBLY ABOUT TWENTY TAKE THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE THE OTHER NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DIE VIOLENT DEATHS IN DUELS IN HUNTING
446-123502-0010 IN AVIATION AND IN WAR BUT PERHAPS BY FAR THE GREATEST DEATH LOSS COMES DURING THE AGE OF CHILDHOOD WHEN VAST NUMBERS OF THE LITTLE MARTIANS FALL VICTIMS TO THE GREAT WHITE APES OF MARS
446-123502-0011 THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A MARTIAN AFTER THE AGE OF MATURITY IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BUT WOULD BE NEARER THE ONE THOUSAND MARK WERE IT NOT FOR THE VARIOUS MEANS LEADING TO VIOLENT DEATH
446-123502-0012 OWING TO THE WANING RESOURCES OF THE PLANET IT EVIDENTLY BECAME NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE INCREASING LONGEVITY WHICH THEIR REMARKABLE SKILL IN THERAPEUTICS AND SURGERY PRODUCED
446-123502-0013 AND SO HUMAN LIFE HAS COME TO BE CONSIDERED BUT LIGHTLY ON MARS AS IS EVIDENCED BY THEIR DANGEROUS SPORTS AND THE ALMOST CONTINUAL WARFARE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES
446-123502-0014 WITHOUT A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION AS WE NEARED THE PLAZA AND MY PRESENCE WAS DISCOVERED WE WERE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THE CREATURES WHO SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PLUCK ME FROM MY SEAT BEHIND MY GUARD A WORD FROM THE LEADER OF THE PARTY
446-123502-0015 STILLED THEIR CLAMOR AND WE PROCEEDED AT A TROT ACROSS THE PLAZA TO THE ENTRANCE OF AS MAGNIFICENT AN EDIFICE AS MORTAL EYE HAS RESTED UPON THE BUILDING WAS LOW BUT COVERED AN ENORMOUS AREA
446-123502-0016 IT WAS CONSTRUCTED OF GLEAMING WHITE MARBLE INLAID WITH GOLD AND BRILLIANT STONES WHICH SPARKLED AND SCINTILLATED IN THE SUNLIGHT THE MAIN ENTRANCE WAS SOME HUNDRED FEET IN WIDTH AND PROJECTED FROM THE BUILDING PROPER
446-123502-0017 TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
446-123502-0018 WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
446-123502-0019 GAY COLORED FEATHERS AND BEAUTIFULLY WROUGHT LEATHER TRAPPINGS INGENIOUSLY SET WITH PRECIOUS STONES FROM HIS SHOULDERS DEPENDED A SHORT CAPE OF WHITE FUR LINED WITH BRILLIANT SCARLET SILK WHAT STRUCK ME AS MOST REMARKABLE
446-123502-0020 ABOUT THIS ASSEMBLAGE AND THE HALL IN WHICH THEY WERE CONGREGATED WAS THE FACT THAT THE CREATURES WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DESKS CHAIRS AND OTHER FURNISHINGS THESE BEING OF A SIZE ADAPTED TO HUMAN BEINGS SUCH AS I
446-123502-0021 WHEREAS THE GREAT BULKS OF THE MARTIANS
446-123502-0022 NOR WAS THERE ROOM BENEATH THE DESKS FOR THEIR LONG LEGS EVIDENTLY THEN THERE WERE OTHER DENIZENS ON MARS THAN THE WILD AND GROTESQUE CREATURES INTO WHOSE HANDS I HAD FALLEN BUT THE EVIDENCES OF EXTREME ANTIQUITY
446-123502-0023 AND AT A SIGN FROM THE LEADER I HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE GROUND AGAIN LOCKING HIS ARM IN MINE WE HAD PROCEEDED INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THERE WERE FEW FORMALITIES OBSERVED IN APPROACHING THE MARTIAN CHIEFTAIN
446-123502-0024 MY CAPTOR MERELY STRODE UP TO THE ROSTRUM THE OTHERS MAKING WAY FOR HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE CHIEFTAIN ROSE TO HIS FEET AND UTTERED THE NAME OF MY ESCORT WHO IN TURN HALTED AND REPEATED THE NAME OF THE RULER FOLLOWED BY HIS TITLE
446-123502-0025 AT THE TIME THIS CEREMONY AND THE WORDS THEY UTTERED MEANT NOTHING TO ME BUT LATER I CAME TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS THE CUSTOMARY GREETING BETWEEN GREEN MARTIANS HAD THE MEN BEEN STRANGERS AND THEREFORE UNABLE TO EXCHANGE NAMES
446-123502-0026 HAD THEIR MISSIONS BEEN PEACEFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCHANGED SHOTS OR HAVE FOUGHT OUT THEIR INTRODUCTION WITH SOME OTHER OF THEIR VARIOUS WEAPONS MY CAPTOR WHOSE NAME WAS TARS TARKAS
446-123502-0027 AND WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED THE CHIEFTAIN ADDRESSED ME AT SOME LENGTH I REPLIED IN OUR GOOD OLD ENGLISH TONGUE MERELY TO CONVINCE HIM THAT NEITHER OF US COULD UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
446-123502-0028 BUT I NOTICED THAT WHEN I SMILED SLIGHTLY ON CONCLUDING HE DID LIKEWISE THIS FACT AND THE SIMILAR OCCURRENCE DURING MY FIRST TALK WITH TARS TARKAS CONVINCED ME THAT WE HAD AT LEAST SOMETHING IN COMMON THE ABILITY TO SMILE
446-123502-0029 THEREFORE TO LAUGH DENOTING A SENSE OF HUMOR BUT I WAS TO LEARN THAT THE MARTIAN SMILE IS MERELY PERFUNCTORY AND THAT THE MARTIAN LAUGH IS A THING TO CAUSE STRONG MEN TO BLANCH IN HORROR THE IDEAS
446-123502-0030 OF INCITANTS TO MERRIMENT THE DEATH AGONIES OF A FELLOW BEING ARE TO THESE STRANGE CREATURES PROVOCATIVE OF THE WILDEST HILARITY WHILE THEIR CHIEF FORM OF COMMONEST AMUSEMENT
446-123502-0031 IS TO INFLICT DEATH ON THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR IN VARIOUS INGENIOUS AND HORRIBLE WAYS THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS AND CHIEFTAINS EXAMINED ME CLOSELY FEELING MY MUSCLES AND THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN
446-123502-0032 THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFTAIN THEN EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED A DESIRE TO SEE ME PERFORM AND MOTIONING ME TO FOLLOW HE STARTED WITH TARS TARKAS FOR THE OPEN PLAZA NOW I HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT TO WALK SINCE MY FIRST SIGNAL FAILURE
446-123502-0033 AND SO NOW I WENT SKIPPING AND FLITTING ABOUT AMONG THE DESKS AND CHAIRS LIKE SOME MONSTROUS GRASSHOPPER AFTER BRUISING MYSELF SEVERELY
446-123502-0034 AND I DID THE ONLY THING A GENTLEMAN MIGHT DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF BRUTALITY BOORISHNESS AND LACK OF CONSIDERATION FOR A STRANGER'S RIGHTS I SWUNG MY FIST SQUARELY TO HIS JAW AND HE WENT DOWN LIKE A FELLED OX
446-123502-0035 AS HE SUNK TO THE FLOOR I WHEELED AROUND WITH MY BACK TOWARD THE NEAREST DESK EXPECTING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FELLOWS BUT DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM AS GOOD A BATTLE AS THE UNEQUAL ODDS WOULD PERMIT BEFORE I GAVE UP MY LIFE
446-123502-0036 MY FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS HOWEVER AS THE OTHER MARTIANS AT FIRST STRUCK DUMB WITH WONDERMENT FINALLY BROKE INTO WILD PEALS OF LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE APPLAUSE AS SUCH BUT LATER
446-123502-0037 WHEN I HAD BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR CUSTOMS I LEARNED THAT I HAD WON WHAT THEY SELDOM ACCORD A MANIFESTATION OF APPROBATION THE FELLOW WHOM I HAD STRUCK LAY WHERE HE HAD FALLEN
446-123502-0038 BUT I WAS NOT LONG IN BEING ENLIGHTENED THEY FIRST REPEATED THE WORD SAK A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN TARS TARKAS MADE SEVERAL JUMPS REPEATING THE SAME WORD BEFORE EACH LEAP THEN TURNING TO ME HE SAID SAK
446-123502-0039 I SAW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER AND GATHERING MYSELF TOGETHER I SAKKED WITH SUCH MARVELOUS SUCCESS THAT I CLEARED A GOOD HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET NOR DID I THIS TIME LOSE MY EQUILIBRIUM BUT LANDED SQUARELY UPON MY FEET
446-123502-0040 WITHOUT FALLING I THEN RETURNED BY EASY JUMPS OF TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY FEET TO THE LITTLE GROUP OF WARRIORS MY EXHIBITION HAD BEEN WITNESSED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED LESSER MARTIANS AND THEY IMMEDIATELY BROKE INTO DEMANDS FOR A REPETITION
446-123502-0041 WHICH THE CHIEFTAIN THEN ORDERED ME TO MAKE BUT I WAS BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND DETERMINED ON THE SPOT THAT MY ONLY METHOD OF SALVATION WAS TO DEMAND THE CONSIDERATION FROM THESE CREATURES
446-123502-0042 WHICH THEY EVIDENTLY WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY ACCORD I THEREFORE IGNORED THE REPEATED COMMANDS TO SAK AND EACH TIME THEY WERE MADE I MOTIONED TO MY MOUTH AND RUBBED MY STOMACH
446-123502-0043 TARS TARKAS AND THE CHIEF EXCHANGED A FEW WORDS AND THE FORMER CALLING TO A YOUNG FEMALE AMONG THE THRONG GAVE HER SOME INSTRUCTIONS AND MOTIONED ME TO ACCOMPANY HER
446-123502-0044 I GRASPED HER PROFFERED ARM AND TOGETHER WE CROSSED THE PLAZA TOWARD A LARGE BUILDING ON THE FAR SIDE MY FAIR COMPANION WAS ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL HAVING JUST ARRIVED AT MATURITY BUT NOT YET TO HER FULL HEIGHT
446-123502-0045 SHE WAS OF A LIGHT OLIVE GREEN COLOR WITH A SMOOTH GLOSSY HIDE HER NAME AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SOLA AND SHE BELONGED TO THE RETINUE OF TARS TARKAS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO A SPACIOUS CHAMBER
446-123502-0046 IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS FRONTING ON THE PLAZA AND WHICH FROM THE LITTER OF SILKS AND FURS UPON THE FLOOR I TOOK TO BE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS OF SEVERAL OF THE NATIVES THE ROOM WAS WELL LIGHTED BY A NUMBER OF LARGE WINDOWS
446-123502-0047 AND WAS BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED WITH MURAL PAINTINGS AND MOSAICS
446-123502-0048 MADE A PECULIAR HISSING SOUND AS THOUGH SIGNALING TO SOMEONE IN AN ADJOINING ROOM IN RESPONSE TO HER CALL I OBTAINED MY FIRST SIGHT OF A NEW MARTIAN WONDER IT WADDLED IN ON ITS TEN SHORT LEGS AND SQUATTED DOWN BEFORE THE GIRL
446-123502-0049 LIKE AN OBEDIENT PUPPY THE THING WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHETLAND PONY
4640-19187-0000 AND JUNE EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT KNEW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT IT THAN JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO SO THE BARRICADE OF THE
4640-19187-0001 AND AN EMBRYO COMPARED TO THE TWO COLOSSAL BARRICADES WHICH WE HAVE JUST SKETCHED BUT IT WAS FORMIDABLE FOR THAT EPOCH
4640-19187-0002 ALL SORTS OF RUBBISH BROUGHT AND ADDED FROM ALL DIRECTIONS COMPLICATED THE EXTERNAL CONFUSION THE REDOUBT HAD BEEN CLEVERLY MADE OVER INTO A WALL ON THE INSIDE AND A THICKET ON THE OUTSIDE
4640-19187-0003 THE STAIRCASE OF PAVING STONES WHICH PERMITTED ONE TO MOUNT IT LIKE THE WALL OF A CITADEL HAD BEEN RECONSTRUCTED THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN PUT IN ORDER THE TAP ROOM DISENCUMBERED
4640-19187-0004 THE KITCHEN APPROPRIATED FOR THE AMBULANCE THE DRESSING OF THE WOUNDED COMPLETED THE POWDER SCATTERED ON THE GROUND AND ON THE TABLES HAD BEEN GATHERED UP
4640-19187-0005 WHICH ALLOWED THE INSURGENTS TO BREATHE MORE FREELY THEY HAD FOUND MEANS OF TAKING REFUGE IN SOME NEIGHBORING HOUSE THE GREATER PART OF THE WOUNDED WERE ABLE AND WISHED TO FIGHT STILL
4640-19187-0006 ON A LITTER OF MATTRESSES AND TRUSSES OF STRAW IN THE KITCHEN WHICH HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN AMBULANCE THERE WERE FIVE MEN GRAVELY WOUNDED TWO OF WHOM WERE MUNICIPAL GUARDSMEN
4640-19187-0007 IN THE INTERIOR OF THIS HALL BARELY LIGHTED BY A CANDLE AT ONE END THE MORTUARY TABLE BEING BEHIND THE POST LIKE A HORIZONTAL BAR
4640-19187-0008 AND MABEUF LYING PRONE THE POLE OF THE OMNIBUS ALTHOUGH SNAPPED OFF BY THE FUSILLADE WAS STILL SUFFICIENTLY UPRIGHT TO ADMIT OF THEIR FASTENING THE FLAG TO IT
4640-19187-0009 THE FIFTY MEN IN THE BARRICADE HAD SPEEDILY EXHAUSTED THE SCANTY PROVISIONS OF THE WINE SHOP DURING THE SIXTEEN HOURS WHICH THEY HAD PASSED THERE
4640-19187-0010 THEY HAD THEN REACHED THE FIRST HOURS OF THAT SPARTAN DAY OF THE SIXTH OF JUNE WHEN IN THE BARRICADE SAINT MERRY JEANNE SURROUNDED BY THE INSURGENTS WHO DEMANDED BREAD REPLIED TO ALL COMBATANTS CRYING SOMETHING TO EAT
4640-19187-0011 WITH WHY
4640-19187-0012 AS THEY COULD NO LONGER EAT
4640-19187-0013 HE INTERDICTED WINE AND PORTIONED OUT THE BRANDY THEY HAD FOUND IN THE CELLAR FIFTEEN FULL BOTTLES HERMETICALLY SEALED
4640-19187-0014 AND IN ORDER THAT NO ONE MIGHT TOUCH THEM HE HAD THEM PLACED UNDER THE TABLE ON WHICH FATHER MABEUF WAS LYING ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THEY RECKONED UP THEIR STRENGTH THERE WERE STILL THIRTY SEVEN OF THEM
4640-19187-0015 THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN THE TORCH WHICH HAD BEEN REPLACED IN ITS CAVITY IN THE PAVEMENT HAD JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THAT SPECIES OF TINY COURTYARD APPROPRIATED FROM THE STREET
4640-19187-0016 THAT TORCH FLICKERING IN THE WIND ANNOYED ME IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF BEING AFRAID THE LIGHT OF TORCHES RESEMBLES THE WISDOM OF COWARDS IT GIVES A BAD LIGHT BECAUSE IT TREMBLES
4640-19187-0017 DAWN AWAKENS MINDS AS IT DOES THE BIRDS ALL BEGAN TO TALK JOLY PERCEIVING A CAT PROWLING ON A GUTTER EXTRACTED PHILOSOPHY FROM IT WHAT IS THE CAT HE EXCLAIMED
4640-19187-0018 IT IS A CORRECTIVE THE GOOD GOD HAVING MADE THE MOUSE SAID HULLO I HAVE COMMITTED A BLUNDER AND SO HE MADE THE CAT THE CAT IS THE ERRATUM OF THE MOUSE
4640-19187-0019 HARMODIUS AND ARISTOGITON BRUTUS CHEREAS STEPHANUS CROMWELL CHARLOTTE CORDAY SAND HAVE ALL HAD THEIR MOMENT OF AGONY WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE
4640-19187-0020 OUR HEARTS QUIVER SO AND HUMAN LIFE IS SUCH A MYSTERY THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF A CIVIC MURDER EVEN IN A MURDER FOR LIBERATION IF THERE BE SUCH A THING
4640-19187-0021 THE REMORSE FOR HAVING STRUCK A MAN SURPASSES THE JOY OF HAVING SERVED THE HUMAN RACE AND SUCH ARE THE WINDINGS OF THE EXCHANGE OF SPEECH THAT A MOMENT LATER BY A TRANSITION BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH JEAN PROUVAIRE'S VERSES
4640-19187-0022 COMBEFERRE WAS COMPARING THE TRANSLATORS OF THE GEORGICS
4640-19187-0023 COURNAND WITH DELILLE POINTING OUT THE PASSAGES TRANSLATED BY MALFILATRE PARTICULARLY THE PRODIGIES OF CAESAR'S DEATH AND AT THAT WORD CAESAR THE CONVERSATION REVERTED TO BRUTUS
4640-19187-0024 CAESAR SAID COMBEFERRE FELL JUSTLY CICERO WAS SEVERE TOWARDS CAESAR AND HE WAS RIGHT THAT SEVERITY IS NOT DIATRIBE
4640-19187-0025 WHEN MAEVIUS INSULTS VIRGIL WHEN VISE INSULTS MOLIERE WHEN POPE INSULTS SHAKSPEARE WHEN FREDERIC INSULTS VOLTAIRE IT IS AN OLD LAW OF ENVY AND HATRED WHICH IS BEING CARRIED OUT
4640-19187-0026 THE BLADE BUT ANTIQUITY ADMITTED IT CAESAR THE VIOLATOR OF THE RUBICON CONFERRING AS THOUGH THEY CAME FROM HIM THE DIGNITIES WHICH EMANATED FROM THE PEOPLE NOT RISING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SENATE
4640-19187-0027 COMMITTED THE ACTS OF A KING AND ALMOST OF A TYRANT
4640-19187-0028 CAESAR IS STABBED BY THE SENATORS CHRIST IS CUFFED BY LACKEYS ONE FEELS THE GOD THROUGH THE GREATER OUTRAGE
4640-19187-0029 HE HAD MADE HIS WAY OUT THROUGH MONDETOUR LANE GLIDING ALONG CLOSE TO THE HOUSES THE INSURGENTS WE WILL REMARK WERE FULL OF HOPE
4640-19187-0030 THAN AS TO THEIR CAUSE MOREOVER SUCCOR WAS EVIDENTLY ON THE WAY TO THEM THEY RECKONED ON IT WITH THAT FACILITY OF TRIUMPHANT PROPHECY WHICH IS ONE OF THE SOURCES OF STRENGTH IN THE FRENCH COMBATANT
4640-19187-0031 THEY DIVIDED THE DAY WHICH WAS AT HAND INTO THREE DISTINCT PHASES
4640-19187-0032 AT NOON THE INSURRECTION OF ALL PARIS AT SUNSET REVOLUTION
4640-19187-0033 WHICH RESEMBLED THE WARLIKE HUM OF A HIVE OF BEES
4640-19187-0034 HE RETURNED FROM HIS SOMBRE EAGLE FLIGHT INTO OUTER DARKNESS HE LISTENED FOR A MOMENT TO ALL THIS JOY WITH FOLDED ARMS AND ONE HAND ON HIS MOUTH THEN
4640-19187-0035 FRESH AND ROSY IN THE GROWING WHITENESS OF THE DAWN HE SAID THE WHOLE ARMY OF PARIS IS TO STRIKE A THIRD OF THE ARMY IS BEARING DOWN UPON THE BARRICADES IN WHICH YOU NOW ARE
4640-19187-0036 AS FOR THE POPULACE IT WAS SEETHING YESTERDAY TO DAY IT IS NOT STIRRING THERE IS NOTHING TO EXPECT NOTHING TO HOPE FOR NEITHER FROM A FAUBOURG NOR FROM A REGIMENT YOU ARE ABANDONED
4640-19187-0037 A MOMENT OF INDESCRIBABLE SILENCE ENSUED IN WHICH DEATH MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD FLITTING BY THIS MOMENT WAS BRIEF
4640-19187-0038 SO BE IT LET US RAISE THE BARRICADE TO A HEIGHT OF TWENTY FEET AND LET US ALL REMAIN IN IT CITIZENS LET US OFFER THE PROTESTS OF CORPSES
4640-19187-0039 IT WAS HAILED WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC ACCLAMATION NO ONE EVER HAS KNOWN THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO SPOKE THUS HE WAS SOME UNKNOWN BLOUSE WEARER A STRANGER
4640-19187-0040 AT A GIVEN MOMENT UTTERS IN A SUPREME FASHION THE DECISIVE WORD AND WHO VANISHES INTO THE SHADOWS AFTER HAVING REPRESENTED FOR A MINUTE IN A LIGHTNING FLASH THE PEOPLE AND GOD
4640-19187-0041 LET US GET OURSELVES KILLED HERE TO THE VERY LAST MAN
4640-19188-0000 CHAPTER FOUR MINUS FIVE PLUS ONE
4640-19188-0001 STILL GREAT AS WAS THIS OMNIPOTENCE A MURMUR AROSE
4640-19188-0002 HE RESUMED HAUGHTILY LET THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF NOT NUMBERING MORE THAN THIRTY SAY SO THE MURMURS REDOUBLED
4640-19188-0003 YOU WOULD FALL IN WITH SOME GRAND GUARD OF THE LINE OR THE SUBURBS
4640-19188-0004 ENTERED THE TAP ROOM THEY EMERGED THENCE A MOMENT LATER
4640-19188-0005 COME SAID HE YOU MUST HAVE A LITTLE PITY DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE QUESTION IS HERE IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN SEE HERE ARE THERE WOMEN OR ARE THERE NOT ARE THERE CHILDREN OR ARE THERE NOT

4640-19188-0007 DIE IF YOU WILL BUT DON'T MAKE OTHERS DIE SUICIDES LIKE THAT WHICH IS ON THE BRINK OF ACCOMPLISHMENT HERE ARE SUBLIME BUT SUICIDE IS NARROW AND DOES NOT ADMIT OF EXTENSION
4640-19188-0008 AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHES YOUR NEIGHBORS SUICIDE IS MURDER THINK OF THE LITTLE BLOND HEADS THINK OF THE WHITE LOCKS
4640-19188-0009 ON THE FIFTH FLOOR AND ON THE PANE THE QUIVERING SHADOW OF THE HEAD OF AN OLD WOMAN WHO HAD THE AIR OF HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT IN WATCHING PERHAPS SHE IS THE MOTHER OF SOME ONE OF YOU
4640-19188-0010 LET HIM FEEL AT EASE THE TASK HERE WILL BE PERFORMED ALL THE SAME WHEN ONE SUPPORTS ONE'S RELATIVES BY ONE'S TOIL ONE HAS NOT THE RIGHT TO SACRIFICE ONE'S SELF
4640-19188-0011 THAT IS DESERTING ONE'S FAMILY AND THOSE WHO HAVE DAUGHTERS WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF YOU GET YOURSELVES KILLED YOU ARE DEAD THAT IS WELL AND TOMORROW YOUNG GIRLS WITHOUT BREAD THAT IS A TERRIBLE THING
4640-19188-0012 WHO SING AND PRATTLE WHO ARE LIKE A LIVING PERFUME WHO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF ANGELS IN HEAVEN BY THE PURITY OF VIRGINS ON EARTH
4640-19188-0013 THOSE ADORABLE AND HONEST CREATURES WHO ARE YOUR BLESSINGS AND YOUR PRIDE AH GOOD GOD THEY WILL SUFFER HUNGER WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY TO YOU
4640-19188-0014 THINK OF THE SHOPS PAST WHICH WOMEN GO AND COME WITH NECKS ALL BARE AND THROUGH THE MIRE THESE WOMEN TOO WERE PURE ONCE THINK OF YOUR SISTERS THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE THEM
4640-19188-0015 YOU ARE NO LONGER ON HAND THAT IS WELL YOU HAVE WISHED TO RELEASE THE PEOPLE FROM ROYALTY AND YOU DELIVER OVER YOUR DAUGHTERS TO THE POLICE FRIENDS HAVE A CARE HAVE MERCY
4640-19188-0016 WE PREVENT THEIR OCCUPYING THEMSELVES WITH POLITICS WILL YOU PREVENT THEM FROM GOING TO THE DEAD HOUSE THIS EVENING AND RECOGNIZING YOUR BODIES LET US SEE THOSE WHO HAVE FAMILIES MUST BE TRACTABLE
4640-19188-0017 AND SHAKE HANDS WITH US AND TAKE THEMSELVES OFF AND LEAVE US HERE ALONE TO ATTEND TO THIS AFFAIR I KNOW WELL THAT COURAGE IS REQUIRED TO LEAVE THAT IT IS HARD BUT THE HARDER IT IS THE MORE MERITORIOUS
4640-19188-0018 YOU SAY I HAVE A GUN I AM AT THE BARRICADE SO MUCH THE WORSE I SHALL REMAIN THERE SO MUCH THE WORSE IS EASILY SAID MY FRIENDS THERE IS A MORROW YOU WILL NOT BE HERE TO MORROW
4640-19188-0019 BUT YOUR FAMILIES WILL AND WHAT SUFFERINGS SEE HERE IS A PRETTY HEALTHY CHILD WITH CHEEKS LIKE AN APPLE WHO BABBLES PRATTLES CHATTERS WHO LAUGHS WHO SMELLS SWEET BENEATH YOUR KISS
4640-19188-0020 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF HIM WHEN HE IS ABANDONED I HAVE SEEN ONE A VERY SMALL CREATURE NO TALLER THAN THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD POOR PEOPLE HAD TAKEN HIM IN OUT OF CHARITY
4640-19188-0021 AND WHOSE PIPE YOU KNOW WAS OF MASTIC AND YELLOW CLAY HIS BREATHING WAS HOARSE HIS FACE LIVID HIS LIMBS FLACCID HIS BELLY PROMINENT HE SAID NOTHING IF YOU SPOKE TO HIM HE DID NOT ANSWER
4640-19188-0022 HE IS DEAD HE WAS TAKEN TO THE NECKER HOSPITAL WHERE I SAW HIM I WAS HOUSE SURGEON IN THAT HOSPITAL
4640-19188-0023 THAT POOR BRAT I REMEMBER AND I SEEM TO SEE HIM NOW WHEN HE LAY NUDE ON THE DISSECTING TABLE HOW HIS RIBS STOOD OUT ON HIS SKIN LIKE THE GRAVES BENEATH THE GRASS IN A CEMETERY
4640-19188-0024 STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MORTALITY AMONG ABANDONED CHILDREN IS FIFTY FIVE PER CENT I REPEAT IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN IT CONCERNS MOTHERS IT CONCERNS YOUNG GIRLS IT CONCERNS LITTLE CHILDREN
4640-19188-0025 BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS WORLD THERE ARE OTHER BEINGS OF WHOM YOU MUST THINK YOU MUST NOT BE EGOISTS ALL DROPPED THEIR HEADS WITH A GLOOMY AIR
4640-19188-0026 STRANGE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART AT ITS MOST SUBLIME MOMENTS COMBEFERRE WHO SPOKE THUS WAS NOT AN ORPHAN HE RECALLED THE MOTHERS OF OTHER MEN AND FORGOT HIS OWN
4640-19188-0027 HE WAS ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF KILLED HE WAS AN EGOIST MARIUS FASTING FEVERED HAVING EMERGED IN SUCCESSION FROM ALL HOPE AND HAVING BEEN STRANDED IN GRIEF THE MOST SOMBRE OF SHIPWRECKS
4640-19188-0028 AND CLASSIFIED BY SCIENCE AND WHICH IS TO SUFFERING WHAT VOLUPTUOUSNESS IS TO PLEASURE DESPAIR ALSO HAS ITS ECSTASY MARIUS HAD REACHED THIS POINT
4640-19188-0029 HE BEHELD MEN GOING AND COMING AS THROUGH A FLAME HE HEARD VOICES SPEAKING AS AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS BUT THIS MOVED HIM THERE WAS IN THIS SCENE A POINT WHICH PIERCED AND ROUSED EVEN HIM
4640-19188-0030 HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA NOW TO DIE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO BE TURNED ASIDE FROM IT BUT HE REFLECTED IN HIS GLOOMY SOMNAMBULISM THAT WHILE DESTROYING HIMSELF
4640-19188-0031 IT IS YOUR DUTY RATHER RETORTED THE MAN YOU HAVE TWO SISTERS WHOM YOU MAINTAIN AND AN UNPRECEDENTED CONTROVERSY BROKE FORTH
4640-19188-0032 THIS IS THE REPUBLIC AND UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE REIGNS DO YOU YOURSELVES DESIGNATE THOSE WHO ARE TO GO THEY OBEYED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES FIVE WERE UNANIMOUSLY SELECTED
4640-19188-0033 AND STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM EXCLAIMED MARIUS THERE WERE ONLY FOUR UNIFORMS WELL BEGAN THE FIVE ONE MUST STAY BEHIND
4640-19188-0034 AND THEN A STRUGGLE AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD REMAIN AND WHO SHOULD FIND REASONS FOR THE OTHERS NOT REMAINING THE GENEROUS QUARREL BEGAN AFRESH YOU HAVE A WIFE WHO LOVES YOU
4640-19188-0035 DO YOU DESIGNATE WHO IS TO REMAIN YES SAID THE FIVE CHOOSE WE WILL OBEY YOU MARIUS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANOTHER EMOTION
4640-19188-0036 WHICH ONE BEHOLDS IN THE DEPTHS OF HISTORY HOVERING OVER THERMOPYLAE
4640-19188-0037 AND MARIUS STUPIDLY COUNTED THEM THERE WERE STILL FIVE OF THEM THEN HIS GLANCE DROPPED TO THE FOUR UNIFORMS AT THAT MOMENT A FIFTH UNIFORM FELL AS IF FROM HEAVEN UPON THE OTHER FOUR
4640-19188-0038 THE FIFTH MAN WAS SAVED
4640-19188-0039 THANKS TO HIS DRESS OF A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE SENTINEL STATIONED BY THE INSURGENTS IN THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD NO OCCASION TO GIVE THE ALARM FOR A SINGLE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
4640-19188-0040 AND HE HAD SILENTLY REMOVED HIS COAT AND FLUNG IT ON THE PILE WITH THE REST THE EMOTION AROUSED WAS INDESCRIBABLE
4640-19189-0000 THE PLENITUDE OF THE REVOLUTION HE WAS INCOMPLETE HOWEVER SO FAR AS THE ABSOLUTE CAN BE SO HE HAD TOO MUCH OF SAINT JUST ABOUT HIM AND NOT ENOUGH OF ANACHARSIS CLOOTS
4640-19189-0001 STILL HIS MIND IN THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C HAD ENDED BY UNDERGOING A CERTAIN POLARIZATION FROM COMBEFERRE'S IDEAS FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY EMERGING FROM THE NARROW FORM OF DOGMA
4640-19189-0002 AND HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO INCLINE TO THE BROADENING INFLUENCE OF PROGRESS AND HE HAD COME TO ACCEPT AS A DEFINITIVE AND MAGNIFICENT EVOLUTION
4640-19189-0003 A SORT OF STIFLED FIRE DARTED FROM HIS EYES WHICH WERE FILLED WITH AN INWARD LOOK ALL AT ONCE HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD HIS BLOND LOCKS FELL BACK LIKE THOSE OF AN ANGEL ON THE SOMBRE QUADRIGA MADE OF STARS
4640-19189-0004 THEY WERE LIKE THE MANE OF A STARTLED LION IN THE FLAMING OF AN HALO
4640-19189-0005 OLD MEN BLESSING CHILDREN THE PAST LOVING THE PRESENT THINKERS ENTIRELY AT LIBERTY BELIEVERS ON TERMS OF FULL EQUALITY FOR RELIGION HEAVEN GOD THE DIRECT PRIEST
4640-19189-0006 HUMAN CONSCIENCE BECOME AN ALTAR NO MORE HATREDS THE FRATERNITY OF THE WORKSHOP AND THE SCHOOL FOR SOLE PENALTY AND RECOMPENSE FAME WORK FOR ALL RIGHT FOR ALL
4640-19189-0007 PEACE OVER ALL NO MORE BLOODSHED NO MORE WARS HAPPY MOTHERS TO CONQUER MATTER IS THE FIRST STEP TO REALIZE THE IDEAL IS THE SECOND REFLECT ON WHAT PROGRESS HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED
4640-19189-0008 AND THE TALONS OF A TIGER FEARFUL BEASTS WHICH WERE ABOVE MAN MAN NEVERTHELESS SPREAD HIS SNARES CONSECRATED BY INTELLIGENCE AND FINALLY CONQUERED THESE MONSTERS
4640-19189-0009 ON THE DAY WHEN THIS PROMETHEAN TASK SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN MAN SHALL HAVE DEFINITELY HARNESSED TO HIS WILL THE TRIPLE CHIMAERA OF ANTIQUITY THE HYDRA THE DRAGON AND THE GRIFFIN
4640-19189-0010 COURAGE AND ONWARD CITIZENS WHITHER ARE WE GOING TO SCIENCE MADE GOVERNMENT TO THE FORCE OF THINGS BECOME THE SOLE PUBLIC FORCE
4640-19189-0011 WE ARE ADVANCING TO THE UNITY OF MAN NO MORE FICTIONS NO MORE PARASITES THE REAL GOVERNED BY THE TRUE THAT IS THE GOAL CIVILIZATION WILL HOLD ITS ASSIZES AT THE SUMMIT OF EUROPE
4640-19189-0012 EUROPE WILL HAVE HER AMPHICTYONS THE GLOBE WILL HAVE ITS AMPHICTYONS FRANCE BEARS THIS SUBLIME FUTURE IN HER BREAST THIS IS THE GESTATION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
4640-19189-0013 I REVERE YOU YES YOU CLEARLY BEHOLD THE FUTURE YES YOU ARE RIGHT YOU HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER
4640-19189-0014 YOU ADOPTED HUMANITY FOR YOUR MOTHER AND RIGHT FOR YOUR FATHER YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE THAT IS TO SAY TO TRIUMPH HERE CITIZENS WHATEVER HAPPENS TO DAY THROUGH OUR DEFEAT AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR VICTORY
4640-19189-0015 WHERE TWO OR THREE OF THESE SOVEREIGNTIES ARE COMBINED THE STATE BEGINS BUT IN THAT ASSOCIATION THERE IS NO ABDICATION EACH SOVEREIGNTY CONCEDES A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF ITSELF FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING THE COMMON RIGHT
4640-19189-0016 THIS QUANTITY IS THE SAME FOR ALL OF US THIS IDENTITY OF CONCESSION WHICH EACH MAKES TO ALL IS CALLED EQUALITY COMMON RIGHT IS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE PROTECTION OF ALL BEAMING ON THE RIGHT OF EACH
4640-19189-0017 THIS PROTECTION OF ALL OVER EACH IS CALLED FRATERNITY THE POINT OF INTERSECTION OF ALL THESE ASSEMBLED SOVEREIGNTIES IS CALLED SOCIETY THIS INTERSECTION BEING A JUNCTION THIS POINT IS A KNOT
4640-19189-0018 HENCE WHAT IS CALLED THE SOCIAL BOND SOME SAY SOCIAL CONTRACT WHICH IS THE SAME THING THE WORD CONTRACT
4640-19189-0019 A SOCIETY OF GREAT BLADES OF GRASS AND TINY OAKS A PROXIMITY OF JEALOUSIES WHICH RENDER EACH OTHER NULL AND VOID LEGALLY SPEAKING IT IS ALL APTITUDES POSSESSED OF THE SAME OPPORTUNITY
4640-19189-0020 POLITICALLY IT IS ALL VOTES POSSESSED OF THE SAME WEIGHT RELIGIOUSLY IT IS ALL CONSCIENCES POSSESSED OF THE SAME RIGHT EQUALITY HAS AN ORGAN GRATUITOUS AND OBLIGATORY INSTRUCTION
4640-19189-0021 AN IDENTICAL SOCIETY WILL SPRING YES INSTRUCTION LIGHT LIGHT EVERYTHING COMES FROM LIGHT AND TO IT EVERYTHING RETURNS CITIZENS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS GREAT BUT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WILL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0022 THEN THERE WILL BE NOTHING MORE LIKE THE HISTORY OF OLD WE SHALL NO LONGER AS TO DAY HAVE TO FEAR A CONQUEST AN INVASION A USURPATION A RIVALRY OF NATIONS
4640-19189-0023 ARMS IN HAND AN INTERRUPTION OF CIVILIZATION DEPENDING ON A MARRIAGE OF KINGS ON A BIRTH IN HEREDITARY TYRANNIES A PARTITION OF PEOPLES BY A CONGRESS A DISMEMBERMENT BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF A DYNASTY
4640-19189-0024 FROM THE FAILURE OF WORK AND THE SCAFFOLD AND THE SWORD AND BATTLES AND THE RUFFIANISM OF CHANCE IN THE FOREST OF EVENTS ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY THERE WILL BE NO MORE EVENTS WE SHALL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0025 AS THE PLANET AROUND THE LIGHT FRIENDS THE PRESENT HOUR IN WHICH I AM ADDRESSING YOU IS A GLOOMY HOUR BUT THESE ARE TERRIBLE PURCHASES OF THE FUTURE A REVOLUTION IS A TOLL
4640-19189-0026 OH THE HUMAN RACE WILL BE DELIVERED RAISED UP CONSOLED WE AFFIRM IT ON THIS BARRIER WHENCE SHOULD PROCEED THAT CRY OF LOVE IF NOT FROM THE HEIGHTS OF SACRIFICE
4640-19189-0027 A HEAP OF IDEAS AND A HEAP OF WOES HERE MISERY MEETS THE IDEAL THE DAY EMBRACES THE NIGHT AND SAYS TO IT I AM ABOUT TO DIE AND THOU SHALT BE BORN AGAIN WITH ME
4640-19189-0028 FROM THE EMBRACE OF ALL DESOLATIONS FAITH LEAPS FORTH SUFFERINGS BRING HITHER THEIR AGONY AND IDEAS THEIR IMMORTALITY THIS AGONY AND THIS IMMORTALITY ARE ABOUT TO JOIN
4640-19189-0029 AND CONSTITUTE OUR DEATH BROTHERS HE WHO DIES HERE DIES IN THE RADIANCE OF THE FUTURE AND WE ARE ENTERING A TOMB ALL FLOODED WITH THE DAWN
4640-19189-0030 HIS LIPS CONTINUED TO MOVE SILENTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF WHICH CAUSED THEM ALL TO GAZE ATTENTIVELY AT HIM IN THE ENDEAVOR TO HEAR MORE THERE WAS NO APPLAUSE
4640-19189-0031 JAVERT LACONIC
4640-19189-0032 LET THE READER RECALL THE STATE OF HIS SOUL WE HAVE JUST RECALLED IT EVERYTHING WAS A VISION TO HIM NOW HIS JUDGMENT WAS DISTURBED
4640-19189-0033 MARIUS LET US INSIST ON THIS POINT WAS UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT DARK WINGS WHICH ARE SPREAD OVER THOSE IN THE DEATH AGONY HE FELT THAT HE HAD ENTERED THE TOMB
4640-19189-0034 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND HE NO LONGER BEHELD THE FACES OF THE LIVING EXCEPT WITH THE EYES OF ONE DEAD
4640-19189-0035 WHAT HAD HE COME THERE TO DO MARIUS DID NOT ADDRESS ALL THESE QUESTIONS TO HIMSELF BESIDES SINCE OUR DESPAIR HAS THIS PECULIARITY THAT IT ENVELOPS OTHERS AS WELL AS OURSELVES
4640-19189-0036 AND HAD NOT EVEN THE AIR OF HEARING HIM WHEN MARIUS RAISED HIS VOICE TO SAY I KNOW HIM
4640-19189-0037 AND IF SUCH A WORD CAN BE USED FOR SUCH IMPRESSIONS WE SHOULD SAY THAT IT PLEASED HIM HE HAD ALWAYS FELT THE ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADDRESSING THAT ENIGMATICAL MAN WHO WAS IN HIS EYES
4640-19189-0038 BOTH EQUIVOCAL AND IMPOSING MOREOVER IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE HE HAD SEEN HIM
4640-19189-0039 THE FIVE CHOSEN MEN LEFT THE BARRICADE BY WAY OF MONDETOUR LANE
4640-19189-0040 ONE OF THEM WEPT AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE BEFORE SETTING OUT THEY EMBRACED THOSE WHO REMAINED WHEN THE FIVE MEN SENT BACK TO LIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE
4640-19189-0041 HE ENTERED THE TAP ROOM
4640-19189-0042 JAVERT REPLIED WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME WAIT WE NEED ALL OUR CARTRIDGES JUST AT PRESENT THEN GIVE ME A DRINK SAID JAVERT
4640-19189-0043 THEY ADDED TO THE SYSTEM OF LIGATURES WHICH RENDERED EVERY ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE THAT SORT OF BOND WHICH IS CALLED IN PRISONS A MARTINGALE WHICH STARTING AT THE NECK
4640-19189-0044 FORKS ON THE STOMACH AND MEETS THE HANDS AFTER PASSING BETWEEN THE LEGS WHILE THEY WERE BINDING JAVERT A MAN STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD WAS SURVEYING HIM WITH SINGULAR ATTENTION
