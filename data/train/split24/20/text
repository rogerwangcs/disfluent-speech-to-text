8098-275181-0000 THEIR SHARP CUR LIKE BARKS USED OFTEN TO ROUSE US AND OF A DARK EVENING WE WOULD HEAR THEM OUT IN THE FIELDS MOUSING AROUND THE STONE HEAPS MAKING A QUEER SQUEAKING SOUND LIKE A MOUSE
8098-275181-0001 TO CALL THE REAL MICE OUT OF THEIR GRASS NESTS INSIDE THE STONE HEAPS THIS INDEED IS A FAVORITE TRICK OF REYNARD AT THE TIME OF MY STORY MY FRIEND TOM EDWARDS TEN YEARS OF AGE
8098-275181-0002 AND MYSELF WERE IN THE TURKEY BUSINESS EQUAL PARTNERS WE OWNED A FLOCK OF THIRTY ONE TURKEYS THESE ROOSTED BY NIGHT IN A LARGE BUTTERNUT TREE IN FRONT OF TOM'S HOUSE IN THE VERY TOP OF IT
8098-275181-0003 AND BY DAY THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE EDGES OF THE CLEARINGS IN QUEST OF BEECH NUTS WHICH WERE VERY PLENTIFUL THAT FALL ALL WENT WELL TILL THE LAST WEEK IN OCTOBER WHEN ON TAKING THE CENSUS ONE MORNING A TURKEY WAS FOUND TO BE MISSING
8098-275181-0004 THE THIRTY ONE HAD BECOME THIRTY SINCE NIGHTFALL THE PREVIOUS EVENING IT WAS THE FIRST ONE WE HAD LOST WE PROCEEDED TO LOOK FOR TRACES OUR SUSPICIONS WERE DIVIDED
8098-275181-0005 TOM THOUGHT IT WAS THE TWOMBLY BOYS NEFARIOUS SAM IN PARTICULAR I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OWL BUT UNDER THE TREE IN THE SOFT DIRT WHERE THE POTATOES HAD RECENTLY BEEN DUG WE FOUND FOX TRACKS
8098-275181-0006 AND TWO OR THREE OMINOUS LITTLE WADS OF FEATHERS WITH ONE LONG TAIL FEATHER ADRIFT THEREUPON WE CONCLUDED THAT THE TURKEY HAD ACCIDENTALLY FALLEN DOWN OUT OF THE BUTTERNUT HAD A FIT PERHAPS
8098-275181-0007 AND A CASUALTY SUCH AS TURKEY RAISERS ARE UNAVOIDABLY HEIRS TO AND WE BORE OUR LOSS WITH RESIGNATION WE WERE GLAD TO REMEMBER THAT TURKEYS DID NOT OFTEN FALL OFF THEIR ROOSTS
8098-275181-0008 THIS THEORY RECEIVED SOMETHING OF A CHECK WHEN OUR FLOCK COUNTED ONLY TWENTY NINE THE NEXT MORNING THERE WERE MORE FOX TRACKS AND A GREAT MANY MORE FEATHERS UNDER THE TREE THIS PUT A NEW AND ALTOGETHER UGLY ASPECT ON THE MATTER
8098-275181-0009 NO ALGEBRA WAS NEEDED TO FIGURE THE OUTCOME OF THE TURKEY BUSINESS AT THIS RATE TOGETHER WITH OUR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS IN THE LIGHT OF THIS NEW FACT IT WAS CLEAR THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND AT ONCE TOO
8098-275181-0010 OR RUIN WOULD SWALLOW UP THE POULTRY FIRM RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY WE ATTRIBUTED THE MISCHIEF TO A CERTAIN SILVER GRAY THAT HAD SEVERAL TIMES BEEN SEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT AUTUMN
8098-275181-0011 IT WOULD TAKE FAR TOO MUCH SPACE TO RELATE IN DETAIL THE PLANS WE LAID AND PUT IN EXECUTION TO CATCH THAT FOX DURING THE NEXT TWO WEEKS I RECOLLECT THAT WE SET THREE TRAPS FOR HIM TO NO PURPOSE
8098-275181-0012 HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING TWO MORE OF THE TURKEYS HEROES IT IS SAID ARE BORN OF GREAT CRISES THIS DILEMMA OF OURS DEVELOPED TOM'S GENIUS I'LL HAVE THAT FOX HE SAID WHEN THE TRAPS FAILED
8098-275181-0013 EACH A WAD OF FINE DRY GRASS AS LARGE AS A QUART BOX THESE WERE GATHERED UP AND FILLED THE GREAT BASKET THERE SAID HE TRIUMPHANTLY DON'T THEM SMELL MOUSEY THEY DID CERTAINLY
8098-275181-0014 THEY SAVORED AS STRONGLY OF MICE AS TOM'S QUESTION OF BAD GRAMMAR AND DON'T FOXES CATCH MICE DEMANDED TOM CONFIDENTLY YES BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S GOING TO CATCH THE FOX I SAID
8098-275181-0015 WELL LOOK HERE THEN I'LL SHOW YE SAID HE
8098-275181-0016 AND YOU WAS PROWLING AROUND THE FIELDS GO OFF NOW OUT THERE BY THAT STUMP FULL OF WONDER AND CURIOSITY I RETIRED TO THE STUMP TOM MEANTIME TURNED OUT THE MASS OF NESTS
8098-275181-0017 AND WITH IT COMPLETELY COVERED HIMSELF THE PILE NOW RESEMBLED AN ENORMOUS MOUSE NEST OR RATHER A SMALL HAY COCK
8098-275181-0018 INSIDE THE NEST EVIDENTLY THERE WERE MICE IN IT AND FEELING MY CHARACTER AS FOX AT STAKE I AT ONCE TROTTED FORWARD THEN CREPT UP AND AS THE RUSTLING AND SQUEAKING CONTINUED MADE A POUNCE INTO THE GRASS
8098-275181-0019 AS I HAD HEARD IT SAID THAT FOXES DID WHEN MOUSING INSTANTLY TWO SPRY BROWN HANDS FROM OUT THE NEST CLUTCHED ME WITH A MOST VENGEFUL GRIP AS A FOX I STRUGGLED TREMENDOUSLY
8098-275181-0020 THEN IN DUMB SHOW KNOCKED MY HEAD WITH A STONE D'YE SEE NOW HE DEMANDED I SAW BUT A FOX WOULD BITE YOU I OBJECTED LET HIM BITE SAID TOM
8098-275181-0021 WITH THE DUSK WE STOLE OUT INTO THE FIELD WHERE THE STONE HEAPS WERE AND WHERE WE HAD OFTENEST HEARD FOXES BARK SELECTING A NOOK IN THE EDGE OF A CLUMP OF RASPBERRY BRIARS WHICH GREW ABOUT A GREAT PINE STUMP
8098-275181-0022 TOM LAY DOWN AND I COVERED HIM UP COMPLETELY WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE BIG BASKET HE THEN PRACTICED SQUEAKING AND RUSTLING SEVERAL TIMES TO BE SURE THAT ALL WAS IN GOOD TRIM HIS SQUEAKS WERE PERFECT SUCCESSES
8098-275181-0023 MADE BY SUCKING THE AIR SHARPLY BETWIXT HIS TEETH NOW BE OFF SAID TOM AND DON'T COME POKING AROUND NOR GET IN SIGHT TILL YOU HEAR ME HOLLER
8098-275181-0024 AND BEING AMIDST NICE COZY STRAW I PRESENTLY WENT TO SLEEP QUITE UNINTENTIONALLY I MUST HAVE SLEPT SOME TIME THOUGH IT SEEMED TO ME BUT A VERY FEW MINUTES WHAT WOKE ME WAS A NOISE A SHARP SUPPRESSED YELP
8098-275181-0025 IT TOOK ME A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WAS AND WHY I WAS THERE A SOUND OF SCUFFLING AND TUMBLING ON THE GROUND AT SOME DISTANCE ASSISTED MY WANDERING WITS AND I RUSHED OUT OF THE BARN AND RAN TOWARD THE FIELD
8098-275181-0026 AS I RAN TWO OR THREE DULL WHACKS CAME TO MY EAR GOT HIM TOM I SHOUTED RUSHING UP TOM WAS HOLDING AND SQUEEZING ONE OF HIS HANDS WITH THE OTHER AND SHAKING IT VIOLENTLY
8098-275181-0027 HE SAID NOT A WORD AND LEFT ME TO POKE ABOUT AND STUMBLE ON THE LIMP WARM CARCASS OF A LARGE FOX THAT LAY NEAR BITE YE I EXCLAIMED AFTER SATISFYING MYSELF THAT THE FOX WAS DEAD SOME SAID TOM
8098-275181-0028 AND THAT WAS ALL I COULD GET FROM HIM THAT NIGHT WE TOOK THE FOX TO THE HOUSE AND LIGHTED A CANDLE IT WAS THE SILVER GRAY TOM WASHED HIS BITE IN COLD WATER AND WENT TO BED
8098-275181-0029 HIS LEFT HAND WAS BITTEN THROUGH THE PALM AND BADLY SWOLLEN THERE WAS ALSO A DEEP BITE IN THE FLESHY PART OF HIS RIGHT ARM JUST BELOW THE ELBOW SEVERAL MINOR NIPS IN HIS LEFT LEG ABOVE THE KNEE AND A RAGGED GRAB
8098-275181-0030 THESE NUMEROUS BITES HOWEVER WERE FOLLOWED BY NO SERIOUS ILL EFFECTS THE NEXT DAY TOM TOLD ME THAT THE FOX HAD SUDDENLY PLUNGED INTO THE GRASS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT HOLD OF ONE OF ITS HIND LEGS
8098-275181-0031 I JUST DETERMINED TO HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT A FOX IS A VERY ACTIVE SHARP BITING ANIMAL AND THAT THIS WAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE MALE I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT TOM GOT OFF VERY WELL
8098-275181-0032 I DO NOT THINK THAT HE EVER CARED TO MAKE A FOX TRAP OF HIMSELF AGAIN HOWEVER WE SOLD THE FOX SKIN IN THE VILLAGE AND RECEIVED THIRTEEN DOLLARS FOR IT WHEREAS A COMMON RED FOX SKIN IS WORTH NO MORE THAN THREE DOLLARS
8098-275181-0033 HOW OR BY WHAT WILES THAT FOX GOT THE TURKEYS OUT OF THE HIGH BUTTERNUT IS A SECRET
8098-278252-0000 MUCH POMP AND SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES FROM WILLOUGHBY WE WENT TO CLEVELAND MY ROUTE THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL CITY LAY ALONG ONE OF THE FINEST RESIDENCE STREETS IN AMERICA THE FAMOUS EUCLID AVENUE
8098-278252-0001 FROM THERE WE MARCHED TO SUPERIOR STREET WHERE CHEERS GREETED US ON EVERY HAND THE PAPERS HAD HERALDED MY ADVENT AND AS IN THE OTHER TOWNS AND CITIES
8098-278252-0002 THE NEWSPAPER ARTISTS HAD TAXED THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO PICTURE POD AND MAC
8098-278252-0003 AND WHEN I RODE OUT ON TO THE STAGE THE HOUSE SHOOK WITH LAUGHTER AND CHEERS I MADE A SHORT ADDRESS AND ANNOUNCED THAT I WOULD SELL PHOTOS OF MAC A'RONY AND HIS MASTER AT THE DOOR
8098-278252-0004 THAT THEATRE PUT ME WAY AHEAD FINANCIALLY THURSDAY MORNING I CALLED ON THE MAYOR MARK HANNA AND SENATOR GARFIELD AND ADDED THE AUTOGRAPHS OF ALL THREE TO MY ALBUM

8098-278252-0008 TWENTY MINUTES LATER A BOY FROM A COZY HOME YELLED TO ME I HAD PASSED TO SOME DISTANCE AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT SOUNDED LIKE
8098-278252-0009 I HESITATED A MOMENT IN THE BITING WIND THEN RETRACED MY STEPS AND CALLED TO THE LAD WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID
8098-278252-0010 YELLED THE SCAMP I WAS MAD ENOUGH TO UNLOAD MY WINCHESTER BUT I DIDN'T
8098-278252-0011 RUBBED MY EARS AND CONTINUED MY JOURNEY LIKE AN ICE COVERED VOLCANO A MILE BEYOND A WAGON WITH A FAMILY IN IT PASSED ME AND THE MAN SAID COLD MY FRIEND AT DUSK A FARMER INQUIRED
8098-278252-0012 I SHOUTED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THE RIG STOPPED A FUR CLAD HEAD STUCK OUT TO ONE SIDE AND A MALE VOICE CALLED
8098-278252-0013 I AMBLED UP PUT A FOOT ON THE HUB OF A WHEEL AND SAID I SIMPLY WANT TO SAY IT'S A COLD DAY YOU AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED I SAID BY WAY OF CIVIL EXPLANATION

8098-278252-0019 WHERE HE ROYALLY ENTERTAINED ME AND MY ANIMALS THE PAGEANT THAT CELEBRATED THE DEPARTURE OF WILLIAM MC KINLEY TO THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT WAS A FAIR ESTIMATE OF THE REGARD IN WHICH HIS FELLOW CITIZENS HELD HIM

8098-278252-0023 CANNON BOOMED STEAM WHISTLES SHRIEKED AND THE CITIZENS SHOUTED AND HURRAHED AND I WAS GLAD MAC WAS NOT WITH ME TO ADD HIS SALUTE
8098-278252-0024 I SAW A MEADOW LARK ON THE FIRST OF MARCH THIS DAY I HEARD BLUE BIRDS AND ROBINS SINGING GAILY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH SPRING HAD COME TO STAY I EXPECTED THAT DAY TO REACH DALTON ONLY EIGHT MILES DISTANT
8098-278252-0025 THAT ONCE I WAS COMPELLED TO CRAWL ALONG THE TOP OF A RAIL FENCE TWO HUNDRED FEET AND MORE AND DRAG MY JACKASS AT DUSK I HAD COVERED ONLY THREE MILES THEN I SOUGHT LODGINGS

8098-278252-0028 I FOUND THE STORE FULL OF LOUNGERS WHO PATRONIZED THE CHAIRS SOAP AND STARCH BOXES MACKEREL KITS AND COUNTER FORMING A SILENT CIRCLE ROUND A TOWERING STOVE IN THE CENTER
8098-278252-0029 THE VILLAGE TREASURER WORE A BOILED SHIRT AND BRASS COLLAR BUTTONS BUT NO COLLAR OR COAT HIS COMPANIONS WERE GENERALLY ATTIRED IN FLANNEL SHIRTS OF DIFFERENT HUES AND PATTERNS
8098-278252-0030 AND FELT BOOTS ENCASED IN HEAVY OVERSHOES THESE RURAL MEN EYED ME WITH SUSPICION UNTIL I MENTIONED MAC A'RONY THEN THERE WAS A RUSH TO THE DOOR AS IT SWUNG OPEN IN LEAPED MY GREAT DOG

8098-278252-0032 AND ONLY THIS MORNING ATE TWO CHICKENS AND A DUCK AND CHASED A FARMER INTO HIS HAY LOFT BUT HE DOESN'T BITE MY STATEMENT HAD A SENSATIONAL EFFECT ON THE ASSEMBLY WHO ONE BY ONE SNEAKED OUT OF THE DOOR
8098-278252-0033 LEAVING HEZ AND HIS ODD GUEST ALONE AS SOON AS THE JUNIOR MEMBER HEZ'S FATHER CAME IN HEZ TOOK MY ANIMALS TO THE SHED AND FED THEM AND TOLD ME TO HELP MYSELF TO THE BEST IN THE STORE
8098-278252-0034 A PINT OF CORNED OYSTERS LIGHT WEIGHT SOME CRACKERS AND LEAF LARD TO TAKE THE PLACE OF BUTTER AND A CAKE OF BITTER CHOCOLATE I LEFT A FEW THINGS UNMOLESTED SUCH AS SOAP
8098-278252-0035 TO BE GOOD CHOCOLATE MUST BE WELL DISSOLVED NO POT WAS TO BE HAD SAVE A FLOWER POT WITH A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM A GREAT IDEA POPPED INTO MY HEAD
8098-278252-0036 DID YOU EVER TRY IT IF NOT DON'T LET YOUR CURIOSITY GET THE BETTER OF YOU CHOCOLATE BELONGS TO THE BEAN FAMILY AND THE BEAN IS A VERY TREACHEROUS THING
8098-278252-0037 CHOCOLATE BEAN CASTOR OIL BEAN PORK BEAN AND ALL KINDS I FIRST ATE THE CAKE OF CHOCOLATE THEN SOME SUGAR AND DRANK TWO DIPPERSFUL OF HOT WATER THEN SHOOK MYSELF
8098-278252-0038 THAT MIXTURE MIGHT SUIT MY STOMACH I THOUGHT BUT IT DOESN'T DELIGHT MY PALATE I FELT I HAD EATEN A HEAVY MEAL UNWITTINGLY AND SAT DOWN TO DIGEST IT I HADN'T SAT LONG BEFORE I FELT MYSELF SWELLING
8098-278252-0039 SOMETHING WITHIN WAS SIZZLING AND BREWING AND STEAMING GAS AND STEAM CHOKED ME I WAS SURE THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DEMONSTRATION IN MY HONOR THAT I HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR THE YEAST CAKE CAME TO MIND THEN I KNEW THE CAUSE
8098-278252-0040 AFTER WHICH I EXCUSED MYSELF TO THE CLERK AND WENT TO BED AND DREAMED I WAS BEING CREMATED ALIVE
8098-278278-0000 BY MAC A'RONY YOU DO ILL TO TEACH THE CHILD SUCH WORDS HE TEACHES HIM TO KICK AND TO HACK WHICH THEY'LL DO FAST ENOUGH OF THEMSELVES AND TO CALL HORUM FYE UPON YOU
8098-278278-0001 MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR FREQUENTLY SINCE CROSSING THE MISSISSIPPI POD HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM PROUD PARENTS INFORMING HIM THAT THEY HAD NAMED THEIR LATEST BOY AFTER HIM
8098-278278-0002 AT THAT TIME IN CRIPPLE CREEK SEVERAL BOYS RANGING FROM A DAY TO SIX WEEKS OLD WHOSE DESTINIES WERE THOUGHT TO BE PROMISING WERE AFFLICTED WITH MY MASTER'S PONDEROUS NAME
8098-278278-0003 A LITTLE GREEN EYED IRISH GIRL FIVE DAYS OLD WAS NAMED PYTHAGORINA PODINA MULGARRY
8098-278278-0004 THE HAPPY FATHER CALLED PERSONALLY ON POD AND ASKED HIM TO ACT AS GODFATHER AT THE BAPTISMAL SERVICE SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE IMPRESSIVE CEREMONY TOOK PLACE AT THE CABIN OF MISS PYTHAGORINA
8098-278278-0005 AS THE AGED GRANDMOTHER WISHED TO WITNESS IT POD SAID HE WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED ABOUT ATTENDING SINCE HE HAD FORGOTTEN ALMOST ALL HIS LATIN
8098-278278-0006 BUT HE ARRANGED WITH ONE OF THE PALL BEARERS TO GIVE HIM NUDGES AND KICKS WHEN IT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE A RESPONSE AND SO HE GOT THROUGH FAIRLY WELL BETTER THAN THE KID DID HE SAID THE BABE WAS AN UNRULY CHILD
8098-278278-0007 AND KICKED SO FRANTICALLY WHEN THE PRIEST TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS THAT TWO FLATIRONS WERE TIED TO ITS FEET TO KEEP THEM DOWN IT WAS SIMPLY NERVOUSNESS BECAUSE THE HIGH ALTITUDE AFFECTED THE CHILD'S NERVES
8098-278278-0008 THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AND SURPRISE BECAUSE THE FLATIRONS DIDN'T FLOAT AND THE UNDERTAKER OR WHAT YOU CALL EM OVERTURNED THE BARREL OF WATER AND SET EVERYBODY AFLOAT DRENCHING THE SPONSORS AND GUESTS
8098-278278-0009 POD SAID THE SCENE WAS WITHOUT A PARALLEL HE WAS SOAKED TO HIS EQUATOR THE HALF CHRISTENED HALF DROWNED PYTHAGORINA PODINA WAS PICKED UP FROM THE FLOOD WITH A TABLESPOON AND THE CEREMONY FINISHED
8098-278278-0010 THEN SHE WAS ROLLED ON THE BARREL TO GET ALL THE WATER OUT OF HER AND PUT TO BED WITH HOT FLATIRONS AT HER FEET TO PREVENT CROUP AND MUMPS THEN THE WAKE BROKE UP I DON'T BELIEVE THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD A WORD THAT THE PRIEST SAID
8098-278278-0011 POD DIDN'T THAT NIGHT HE GOT UP A FINE SUPPER AND INVITED SOME OLD FRIENDS HE BOUGHT A BIG PORTERHOUSE STEAK THICK AND TENDER AND PERSONALLY BROILED IT ON HIS PATENT FOLDING STOVE
8098-278278-0012 JUST WHEN EVERYTHING WAS ON THE TABLE AND THE GUESTS WERE FINDING STONES AND TIN PLATES TO SIT ON DON NOT HAVING HAD A THING TO EAT FOR AN HOUR COOLLY PULLED THE HOT STEAK OFF THE PLATTER AND DROPPED IT ON THE GROUND
8098-278278-0013 POD DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING THOUGH BUT JUST FORKED IT ON TO THE PLATTER AND SCRAPED OFF SOME DRY GRASS AND A SLIVER AND A BUG AND CARVED IT UP
8098-278278-0014 THE LADIES LOOKED AT THE DOG AND THEN AT POD NOT KNOWING WHICH TO THANK THEN FEELING SENSITIVE ABOUT ACCEPTING THE BEST PART OF THE STEAK INSISTED UPON POD'S HAVING ONE OF THEIR PIECES AND COONSKIN THE OTHER
8098-278278-0015 AFTER SUPPER DON FEASTED ON THE TOUGHER PARTS OF THE STEAK AND WE DONKS WERE FED THE SCRAPS OF POTATOES AND BREAD AND TIN TOMATO AND PEACH CANS WHEN THE BANQUET WAS OVER THE GUESTS WENT HOME
8098-278278-0016 ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK WE WENT INTO CAMP ON THE MARGIN OF A FAMOUS PETRIFIED FOREST POD OBJECTED AT FIRST BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF FIRE WOOD
8098-278278-0017 LOTS OF PETRIFIED WOOD CHIPS LYING AROUND I REMARKED AND THEY'LL LAST ORDINARY WOOD BURNS UP TOO FAST BRIGHT IDEA EXCLAIMED POD AND COONSKIN WENT TO WORK GATHERING PETRIFIED WOOD FOR THE SUPPER FIRE
8098-278278-0018 THE ONLY TROUBLE WILL BE IN STARTING THE FIRE SAID POD JUST AS SOON AS IT'S ONCE GOING IT OUGHT TO BURN SMOOTHLY ENOUGH
8098-278278-0019 COONSKIN'S OPINION DIDN'T BENEFIT POD MUCH HIS HARD WOOD FIRE WASN'T VERY SATISFACTORY BUT WITH SOME DRY BRUSH THE MEN GOT THE MEAL UNDER WAY NEXT MORNING WE VISITED THE NOTED PETRIFIED STUMP
8098-278278-0020 MEASURING UPWARDS OF FORTY FIVE FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE SEVERAL SAWS WERE IMBEDDED IN IT FOR MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO TAKE OFF SOME SLICES FOR THE DENVER EXPOSITION
8098-278278-0021 IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY VARIOUS ORNITHOLOGISTS BOTANISTS AND ENTOMOLOGISTS THAT THE STUMP IS MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD I THINK THEY WERE GUESSING AT IT FOR I COULDN'T SEE THE RINGS
8098-278278-0022 SEVERAL TIMES I HAD A SUSPICION THAT WE HAD BEEN MISDIRECTED WHEN WE CAME TO THE END OF A NARROW WOOD ROAD I WAS SURE OF IT
8098-278278-0023 BEST TO GO THROUGH THE WOODS SAID THE VALET SO WE WERE HEADED FOR THE TIMBER OUR TRAMP THROUGH THE FOREST I CANNOT SOON FORGET UP AND DOWN THE ROCKY HEIGHTS THROUGH THICKETS OF QUAKING ASP AND PINE
8098-278278-0024 AND REALIZED WE WERE LOST COONSKIN SAID HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED WOODMAN AND WOULD BLAZE THE TREES SO WE WOULD GET OUT AGAIN WONDERFUL THE AMOUNT OF LEARNING HE HAD GLEANED FROM DIME NOVELS
8098-278278-0025 HE LAGGED BEHIND TO DO THE BLAZING AND PRETTY SOON I SMELT SMOKE THE PROFESSOR SNUFFED SMELLS AS IF THE WOODS WERE ON FIRE SOMEWHERE HINTED POD LOOK BEHIND YOU THEY ARE I EXCLAIMED
8098-278278-0026 AND POD CAUGHT THAT ERUDITE VALET BACK WOODSMAN IN THE ACT OF SETTING A TREE ON FIRE WITH OIL AND MATCHES FORTUNATELY FOR US THE WIND WASN'T BLOWING STRONG
8098-278278-0027 BUT WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR COURSE SOME AND HUSTLE FASTER FOR THE BLAZING TRAIL CHASED US COONSKIN LEARNED A NEW LESSON AND TURNED DOWN THE CORNER OF THE PAGE SO HE'D RECOLLECT IT
8098-278278-0028 A BOARD SIGN INFORMED US IT WAS SIMPLY TURKEY CREEK I COULDN'T SEE ANY TURKEYS BUT THERE WAS GOOD PASTURAGE AROUND THE HOT TRIP THROUGH THE TIMBER MADE US ALL HUNGRY
8098-278278-0029 IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK WHEN WE DONKS WERE PICKETED AND ALLOWED TO GRAZE THEN COONSKIN WENT FISHING HE SAID HE HAD SEEN SOME TROUT IN THE STREAM BY SUPPER TIME HE HAD CAUGHT A NICE MESS
8098-278278-0030 POD SAID HE WOULD FRY THE FISH AND WENT AT IT SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT HE FORGOT TO PUT THE BAG OF CORN MEAL BACK IN ITS PLACE AFTER THE MEAL WAS OVER HE BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND FOR THE BAG IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
8098-278278-0031 I HAD EATEN THE CORN MEAL AND BAG IT WAS COMICAL HOW THOSE TWO MEN PUZZLED THEIR BRAINS ABOUT THAT MISSING COMMODITY WHEN COONSKIN DETECTED SOME MEAL STAMPED IN THE GROUND POD POINTED AT ME AND SAID
8098-278278-0032 THAT'S THE THIEF THERE NEXT MORNING COONSKIN WAS THE FIRST TO RETURN FROM FISHING AND LOOKED MUCH EXCITED WHEN POD RETURNED HE TOLD HIM HE HAD SEEN HUGE BEAR TRACKS HE WAS GOING BEAR HUNTING POD LAUGHED AT HIM
8098-278278-0033 THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN THE WOODS OF WISCONSIN THE MEN AT THE SAW MILL SAID WE SHOULD SEE BEAR IN THIS FOREST
8098-278278-0034 ITS SKIN WOULD FETCH FIFTY DOLLARS OR MORE LET'S LOOK FOR BEAR WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU SAW A BEAR POD ASKED WELL NOW LEAVE THAT TO ME SAID COONSKIN
8098-278278-0035 IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WOULD BE WORTH A HAIRBREADTH ESCAPE TO SEE ONE WILD I'VE ONLY SEEN BEARS IN CIRCUSES OR TRAVELING CHAINED TO ITALIANS IN THE SECOND PLACE I CAN RUN I'VE PLENTY OF MEDALS FOR SPRINTING
8098-278278-0036 POD WENT FISHING THAT AFTERNOON WITH A GUN AND TOOK THE WHOLE ARSENAL ALONG WITH HIM INCLUDING THE AXE SOMEWHERE ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK POD CAME INTO CAMP WITH A GOOD MESS OF TROUT AFTER CLEANING THE FISH HE TOOK OFF HIS GUNS
8098-278278-0037 AND LAID DOWN ON THE GRASS AND WONDERED IF THAT CRAZY VALET HAD RUN ACROSS ANY MORE BEAR TRACKS HE WASN'T THERE LONG WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD YELLS ISSUING FROM THE CANYON DOWN STREAM ROUND THE BEND
8098-278278-0038 THE SHOUTING SOUNDED NEARER EVERY SECOND AND I SOON DISTINGUISHED COONSKIN'S VOICE POD GOT UP FROM THE GROUND EXCITEDLY COONSKIN'S IN TROUBLE PLAIN ENOUGH SAID POD ALOUD TO HIMSELF I MUST RUN TO HIS AID
8098-278278-0039 SO HE STARTED ON A TROT DOWN STREAM TO THE BEND AND THEN QUICKLY TURNED FALLING ALL OVER HIMSELF AND RAN TOWARD THE CABINS FASTER THAN I EVER SAW HIM RUN BEFORE OR SINCE
8098-278278-0040 AND IMMEDIATELY COONSKIN CAME FLYING INTO VIEW WITH THE BIGGEST BEAR AT HIS HEELS I EVER WANT TO SEE
