4051-10927-0000 IT'S LATE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHE SAID WHEN SHE HAD GONE THROUGH THE DOORWAY ANNA IT'S NECESSARY FOR ME TO HAVE A TALK WITH YOU WITH ME SHE SAID WONDERINGLY SHE CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE DOOR OF THE DRESSING ROOM AND LOOKED AT HIM
4051-10927-0001 WHY WHAT IS IT WHAT ABOUT SHE ASKED SITTING DOWN WELL LET'S TALK IF IT'S SO NECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO GET TO SLEEP ANNA SAID WHAT CAME TO HER LIPS AND MARVELED HEARING HERSELF AT HER OWN CAPACITY FOR LYING
4051-10927-0002 HOW SIMPLE AND NATURAL WERE HER WORDS AND HOW LIKELY THAT SHE WAS SIMPLY SLEEPY
4051-10927-0003 THAT ANYONE WHO DID NOT KNOW HER AS HER HUSBAND KNEW HER COULD NOT HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING UNNATURAL EITHER IN THE SOUND OR THE SENSE OF HER WORDS BUT TO HIM KNOWING HER KNOWING THAT WHENEVER HE WENT TO BED FIVE MINUTES LATER THAN USUAL
4051-10927-0004 SHE NOTICED IT AND ASKED HIM THE REASON TO HIM KNOWING THAT EVERY JOY EVERY PLEASURE AND PAIN THAT SHE FELT SHE COMMUNICATED TO HIM AT ONCE TO HIM NOW TO SEE THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO NOTICE HIS STATE OF MIND
4051-10927-0005 THAT SHE DID NOT CARE TO SAY A WORD ABOUT HERSELF MEANT A GREAT DEAL HE SAW THAT THE INMOST RECESSES OF HER SOUL THAT HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO LAIN OPEN BEFORE HIM WERE CLOSED AGAINST HIM MORE THAN THAT HE SAW FROM HER TONE
4051-10927-0006 THAT SHE WAS NOT EVEN PERTURBED AT THAT BUT AS IT WERE SAID STRAIGHT OUT TO HIM YES IT'S SHUT UP AND SO IT MUST BE AND WILL BE IN FUTURE NOW HE EXPERIENCED A FEELING SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT HAVE RETURNING HOME AND FINDING HIS OWN HOUSE LOCKED UP
4051-10927-0007 BUT PERHAPS THE KEY MAY YET BE FOUND THOUGHT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH I WANT TO WARN YOU HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE THAT THROUGH THOUGHTLESSNESS AND LACK OF CAUTION
4051-10927-0008 YOUR TOO ANIMATED CONVERSATION THIS EVENING WITH COUNT VRONSKY HE ENUNCIATED THE NAME FIRMLY AND WITH DELIBERATE EMPHASIS ATTRACTED ATTENTION HE TALKED AND LOOKED AT HER LAUGHING EYES WHICH FRIGHTENED HIM NOW WITH THEIR IMPENETRABLE LOOK
4051-10927-0009 I WASN'T DULL DOES THAT OFFEND YOU ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHIVERED AND BENT HIS HANDS TO MAKE THE JOINTS CRACK
4051-10927-0010 ANNA IS THIS YOU SAID ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH QUIETLY MAKING AN EFFORT OVER HIMSELF AND RESTRAINING THE MOTION OF HIS FINGERS
4051-10927-0011 WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH PAUSED AND RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD AND HIS EYES HE SAW THAT INSTEAD OF DOING AS HE HAD INTENDED THAT IS TO SAY WARNING HIS WIFE AGAINST A MISTAKE IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD
4051-10927-0012 HE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY BECOME AGITATED OVER WHAT WAS THE AFFAIR OF HER CONSCIENCE AND WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE BARRIER HE FANCIED BETWEEN THEM
4051-10927-0013 AND I BEG YOU TO LISTEN TO IT I CONSIDER JEALOUSY AS YOU KNOW A HUMILIATING AND DEGRADING FEELING AND I SHALL NEVER ALLOW MYSELF TO BE INFLUENCED BY IT BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES OF DECORUM WHICH CANNOT BE DISREGARDED WITH IMPUNITY THIS EVENING IT WAS NOT I OBSERVED IT
4051-10927-0014 BUT JUDGING BY THE IMPRESSION MADE ON THE COMPANY EVERYONE OBSERVED THAT YOUR CONDUCT AND DEPORTMENT WERE NOT ALTOGETHER WHAT COULD BE DESIRED I POSITIVELY DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID ANNA SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS HE DOESN'T CARE SHE THOUGHT
4051-10927-0015 BUT OTHER PEOPLE NOTICED IT AND THAT'S WHAT UPSETS HIM YOU'RE NOT WELL ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHE ADDED AND SHE GOT UP AND WOULD HAVE GONE TOWARDS THE DOOR BUT HE MOVED FORWARD AS THOUGH HE WOULD STOP HER HIS FACE WAS UGLY AND FORBIDDING
4051-10927-0016 AS ANNA HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SHE STOPPED AND BENDING HER HEAD BACK AND ON ONE SIDE BEGAN WITH HER RAPID HAND TAKING OUT HER HAIRPINS WELL I'M LISTENING TO WHAT'S TO COME SHE SAID CALMLY AND IRONICALLY AND INDEED I LISTEN WITH INTEREST
4051-10927-0017 BEGAN ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH FERRETING IN ONE'S SOUL ONE OFTEN FERRETS OUT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE LAIN THERE UNNOTICED YOUR FEELINGS ARE AN AFFAIR OF YOUR OWN CONSCIENCE
4051-10927-0018 TO MYSELF AND TO GOD TO POINT OUT TO YOU YOUR DUTIES OUR LIFE HAS BEEN JOINED NOT BY MAN BUT BY GOD THAT UNION CAN ONLY BE SEVERED BY A CRIME AND A CRIME OF THAT NATURE BRINGS ITS OWN CHASTISEMENT
4051-10927-0019 I DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD AND OH DEAR HOW SLEEPY I AM UNLUCKILY SHE SAID RAPIDLY PASSING HER HAND THROUGH HER HAIR FEELING FOR THE REMAINING HAIRPINS ANNA FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T SPEAK LIKE THAT HE SAID GENTLY PERHAPS I AM MISTAKEN
4051-10927-0020 BUT BELIEVE ME WHAT I SAY I SAY AS MUCH FOR MYSELF AS FOR YOU I AM YOUR HUSBAND AND I LOVE YOU FOR AN INSTANT HER FACE FELL AND THE MOCKING GLEAM IN HER EYES DIED AWAY BUT THE WORD LOVE THREW HER INTO REVOLT AGAIN SHE THOUGHT
4051-10927-0021 LOVE CAN HE LOVE IF HE HADN'T HEARD THERE WAS SUCH A THING AS LOVE HE WOULD NEVER HAVE USED THE WORD HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LOVE IS ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH REALLY I DON'T UNDERSTAND SHE SAID DEFINE WHAT IT IS YOU FIND
4051-10927-0022 THAT MY WORDS SEEM TO YOU UTTERLY UNNECESSARY AND OUT OF PLACE
4051-10927-0023 IN THAT CASE I BEG YOU TO FORGIVE ME BUT IF YOU ARE CONSCIOUS YOURSELF OF EVEN THE SMALLEST FOUNDATION FOR THEM
4051-10927-0024 WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE BEDROOM HE WAS ALREADY IN BED HIS LIPS WERE STERNLY COMPRESSED AND HIS EYES LOOKED AWAY FROM HER ANNA GOT INTO HER BED AND LAY EXPECTING EVERY MINUTE THAT HE WOULD BEGIN TO SPEAK TO HER AGAIN SHE BOTH FEARED HIS SPEAKING AND WISHED FOR IT
4051-10927-0025 BUT HE WAS SILENT SHE WAITED FOR A LONG WHILE WITHOUT MOVING AND HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM SHE THOUGHT OF THAT OTHER SHE PICTURED HIM AND FELT HOW HER HEART WAS FLOODED WITH EMOTION AND GUILTY DELIGHT AT THE THOUGHT OF HIM SUDDENLY
4051-10927-0026 SHE HEARD AN EVEN TRANQUIL SNORE FOR THE FIRST INSTANT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SEEMED AS IT WERE APPALLED AT HIS OWN SNORING AND CEASED BUT AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO BREATHINGS THE SNORE SOUNDED AGAIN
4051-10927-0027 WITH A NEW TRANQUIL RHYTHM IT'S LATE IT'S LATE SHE WHISPERED WITH A SMILE
4051-11217-0000 WHY IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME THEY WERE THE SONS OF THAT VERY PHRIXUS WHO IN HIS CHILDHOOD HAD BEEN CARRIED TO COLCHIS ON THE BACK OF THE GOLDEN FLEECED RAM SINCE THAT TIME PHRIXUS HAD MARRIED THE KING'S DAUGHTER
4051-11217-0001 AND HAD SPENT THEIR PLAY DAYS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE GROVE IN THE CENTER OF WHICH THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS HANGING UPON A TREE THEY WERE NOW ON THEIR WAY TO GREECE IN HOPES OF GETTING BACK A KINGDOM THAT HAD BEEN WRONGFULLY TAKEN FROM THEIR FATHER
4051-11217-0002 WHEN THE PRINCES UNDERSTOOD WHITHER THE ARGONAUTS WERE GOING THEY OFFERED TO TURN BACK AND GUIDE THEM TO COLCHIS
4051-11217-0003 EVERY PERSON WHO MIGHT VENTURE WITHIN HIS REACH THERE ARE OTHER DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG PRINCES
4051-11217-0004 I DO NOT WONDER THAT YOU THINK THE DRAGON VERY TERRIBLE YOU HAVE GROWN UP FROM INFANCY IN THE FEAR OF THIS MONSTER
4051-11217-0005 AT ALL EVENTS TURN BACK WHO MAY I WILL NEVER SEE GREECE AGAIN UNLESS I CARRY WITH ME THE GOLDEN FLEECE WE WILL NONE OF US TURN BACK CRIED HIS NINE AND FORTY BRAVE COMRADES
4051-11217-0006 MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO HIM AND ORPHEUS WHOSE CUSTOM IT WAS TO SET EVERYTHING TO MUSIC BEGAN TO HARP AND SING MOST GLORIOUSLY
4051-11217-0007 AND NOTHING SO TRULY HONORABLE AS TO BE EATEN UP AT ONE MOUTHFUL IN CASE OF THE WORST AFTER THIS BEING NOW UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE TWO PRINCES WHO WERE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE WAY
4051-11217-0008 HEARD OF THEIR ARRIVAL HE INSTANTLY SUMMONED JASON TO COURT
4051-11217-0009 WHO DETHRONED HIS FATHER YOU ARE WELCOME BRAVE JASON
4051-11217-0010 PRAY ARE YOU ON A PLEASURE VOYAGE
4051-11217-0011 OR WHAT OTHER CAUSE HAS PROCURED ME THE HAPPINESS OF SEEING YOU AT MY COURT GREAT SIR REPLIED JASON
4051-11217-0012 FOR CHIRON HAD TAUGHT HIM HOW TO BEHAVE WITH PROPRIETY WHETHER TO KINGS OR BEGGARS
4051-11217-0013 PROVIDED I BRING HIM THE GOLDEN FLEECE THIS AS YOUR MAJESTY IS AWARE IS NOW HANGING ON A TREE HERE AT COLCHIS AND I HUMBLY SOLICIT YOUR GRACIOUS LEAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY IN SPITE OF HIMSELF THE KING'S FACE TWISTED ITSELF INTO AN ANGRY FROWN
4051-11217-0014 FOR ABOVE ALL THINGS ELSE IN THE WORLD HE PRIZED THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND WAS EVEN SUSPECTED OF HAVING DONE A VERY WICKED ACT IN ORDER TO GET IT INTO HIS OWN POSSESSION
4051-11217-0015 HAD COME TO COLCHIS WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF TAKING AWAY HIS CHIEF TREASURE
4051-11217-0016 WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS WHICH YOU MUST FULFILL BEFORE GETTING POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE I HAVE HEARD REJOINED THE YOUTH THAT A DRAGON LIES BENEATH THE TREE ON WHICH THE PRIZE HANGS AND THAT WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM RUNS THE RISK OF BEING DEVOURED AT A MOUTHFUL
4051-11217-0017 TRUE SAID THE KING WITH A SMILE THAT DID NOT LOOK PARTICULARLY GOOD NATURED VERY TRUE YOUNG MAN BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AS HARD OR PERHAPS A LITTLE HARDER TO BE DONE BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING DEVOURED BY THE DRAGON FOR EXAMPLE
4051-11217-0018 WHICH VULCAN THE WONDERFUL BLACKSMITH MADE FOR ME THERE IS A FURNACE IN EACH OF THEIR STOMACHS AND THEY BREATHE SUCH HOT FIRE OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS AND NOSTRILS THAT NOBODY HAS HITHERTO GONE NIGH THEM WITHOUT BEING INSTANTLY BURNED TO A SMALL BLACK CINDER
4051-11217-0019 I MUST ENCOUNTER THE PERIL ANSWERED JASON COMPOSEDLY SINCE IT STANDS IN THE WAY OF MY PURPOSE
4051-11217-0020 FROM WHICH CADMUS RAISED A CROP OF ARMED MEN THEY ARE AN UNRULY SET OF REPROBATES THOSE SONS OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH AND UNLESS YOU TREAT THEM SUITABLY THEY WILL FALL UPON YOU SWORD IN HAND
4051-11217-0021 AND THE FOUR FOOTED PEDANT HIS SCHOOLMASTER INTO THE BARGAIN WHY WHAT A FOOLHARDY SELF CONCEITED COXCOMB HE IS WE'LL SEE WHAT MY FIRE BREATHING BULLS WILL DO FOR HIM WELL PRINCE JASON HE CONTINUED ALOUD AND AS COMPLAISANTLY AS HE COULD
4051-11217-0022 MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE FOR TO DAY AND TO MORROW MORNING SINCE YOU INSIST UPON IT YOU SHALL TRY YOUR SKILL AT THE PLOW WHILE THE KING TALKED WITH JASON A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN WAS STANDING BEHIND THE THRONE SHE FIXED HER EYES EARNESTLY UPON THE YOUTHFUL STRANGER
4051-11217-0023 THIS YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM I AM THE KING'S DAUGHTER SHE SAID TO HIM AND MY NAME IS MEDEA I KNOW A GREAT DEAL OF WHICH OTHER YOUNG PRINCESSES ARE IGNORANT AND CAN DO MANY THINGS WHICH THEY WOULD BE AFRAID SO MUCH AS TO DREAM OF IF YOU WILL TRUST TO ME
4051-11217-0024 I CAN INSTRUCT YOU HOW TO TAME THE FIERY BULLS AND SOW THE DRAGON'S TEETH AND GET THE GOLDEN FLEECE INDEED BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS ANSWERED JASON IF YOU WILL DO ME THIS SERVICE I PROMISE TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU MY WHOLE LIFE LONG GAZING AT MEDEA
4051-11217-0025 HE BEHELD A WONDERFUL INTELLIGENCE IN HER FACE SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHOSE EYES ARE FULL OF MYSTERY SO THAT WHILE LOOKING INTO THEM
4051-11217-0026 YET CAN NEVER BE CERTAIN WHETHER YOU SEE INTO THE FARTHEST DEPTHS OR WHETHER THERE BE NOT SOMETHING ELSE HIDDEN AT THE BOTTOM IF JASON HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF FEARING ANYTHING
4051-11217-0027 FOR BEAUTIFUL AS SHE NOW LOOKED
4051-11217-0028 PRINCESS HE EXCLAIMED YOU SEEM INDEED VERY WISE AND VERY POWERFUL BUT HOW CAN YOU HELP ME TO DO THE THINGS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK ARE YOU AN ENCHANTRESS YES PRINCE JASON ANSWERED MEDEA WITH A SMILE
4051-11217-0029 IT IS WELL FOR YOU THAT I AM FAVORABLY INCLINED FOR OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HARDLY ESCAPE BEING SNAPPED UP BY THE DRAGON I SHOULD NOT SO MUCH CARE FOR THE DRAGON REPLIED JASON IF I ONLY KNEW HOW TO MANAGE THE BRAZEN FOOTED AND FIERY LUNGED BULLS
4051-11217-0030 WHICH WILL PREVENT YOU FROM BEING BURNED UP AND CURE YOU IF YOU CHANCE TO BE A LITTLE SCORCHED
4051-11217-0031 WHICH IT CONTAINED AND WHERE TO MEET HER AT MIDNIGHT ONLY BE BRAVE ADDED SHE AND BEFORE DAYBREAK THE BRAZEN BULLS SHALL BE TAMED THE YOUNG MAN ASSURED HER THAT HIS HEART WOULD NOT FAIL HIM HE THEN REJOINED HIS COMRADES AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THE PRINCESS AND HIMSELF
4051-11217-0032 AND WARNED THEM TO BE IN READINESS IN CASE THERE MIGHT BE NEED OF THEIR HELP AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE MET THE BEAUTIFUL MEDEA ON THE MARBLE STEPS OF THE KING'S PALACE
4051-11217-0033 JUST AS THEY HAD BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE MONSTER'S JAWS BY CADMUS LONG AGO MEDEA THEN LED JASON DOWN THE PALACE STEPS AND THROUGH THE SILENT STREETS OF THE CITY AND INTO THE ROYAL PASTURE GROUND WHERE THE TWO BRAZEN FOOTED BULLS WERE KEPT IT WAS A STARRY NIGHT
4051-11217-0034 WITH A BRIGHT GLEAM ALONG THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE SKY
4051-11217-0035 IN THAT FARTHEST CORNER OF THE FIELD IT WILL BE EXCELLENT SPORT I ASSURE YOU WHEN THEY CATCH A GLIMPSE OF YOUR FIGURE MY FATHER AND ALL HIS COURT DELIGHT IN NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE A STRANGER TRYING TO YOKE THEM IN ORDER TO COME AT THE GOLDEN FLEECE
4051-11217-0036 IT MAKES A HOLIDAY IN COLCHIS WHENEVER SUCH A THING HAPPENS FOR MY PART I ENJOY IT IMMENSELY YOU CANNOT IMAGINE IN WHAT A MERE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THEIR HOT BREATH SHRIVELS A YOUNG MAN INTO A BLACK CINDER ARE YOU SURE BEAUTIFUL MEDEA ASKED JASON
4051-11217-0037 THE INSTANT HE MADE A STEP FARTHER
4051-11217-0038 THESE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WERE CAUSED BY THE BREATH OF THE BRAZEN BULLS WHICH WAS QUIETLY STEALING OUT OF THEIR FOUR NOSTRILS AS THEY LAY CHEWING THEIR CUDS AT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE STEPS WHICH JASON MADE
4051-11217-0039 THE FOUR FIERY STREAMS APPEARED TO GUSH OUT SOMEWHAT MORE PLENTIFULLY FOR THE TWO BRAZEN BULLS HAD HEARD HIS FOOT TRAMP AND WERE LIFTING UP THEIR HOT NOSES TO SNUFF THE AIR HE WENT A LITTLE FARTHER
4051-11217-0040 ONE OTHER STRIDE DID BOLD JASON MAKE AND SUDDENLY AS A STREAK OF LIGHTNING ON CAME THESE FIERY ANIMALS
4051-11217-0041 AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FASHION WITH ANGRY BULLS THEIR BREATH SCORCHED THE HERBAGE BEFORE THEM SO INTENSELY HOT IT WAS INDEED THAT IT CAUGHT A DRY TREE UNDER WHICH JASON WAS NOW STANDING AND SET IT ALL IN A LIGHT BLAZE BUT AS FOR JASON HIMSELF
4051-11218-0000 GREATLY ENCOURAGED AT FINDING HIMSELF NOT YET TURNED INTO A CINDER
4051-11218-0001 JUST AS THE BRAZEN BRUTES FANCIED THEMSELVES SURE OF TOSSING HIM INTO THE AIR HE CAUGHT ONE OF THEM BY THE HORN AND THE OTHER BY HIS SCREWED UP TAIL AND HELD THEM IN A GRIPE LIKE THAT OF AN IRON VICE ONE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE OTHER WITH HIS LEFT
4051-11218-0002 TO BE SURE BUT THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THE BRAZEN BULLS WERE ENCHANTED CREATURES AND THAT JASON HAD BROKEN THE SPELL OF THEIR FIERY FIERCENESS BY HIS BOLD WAY OF HANDLING THEM AND EVER SINCE THAT TIME
4051-11218-0003 WHEN DANGER ASSAILS THEM TO DO WHAT THEY CALL TAKING THE BULL BY THE HORNS AND TO GRIPE HIM BY THE TAIL IS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING THAT IS TO THROW ASIDE FEAR AND OVERCOME THE PERIL BY DESPISING IT
4051-11218-0004 IT WAS NOW EASY TO YOKE THE BULLS AND TO HARNESS THEM TO THE PLOW
4051-11218-0005 WHO PERHAPS USED TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE HARNESSED TO THE PLOW AT ANY RATE OUR HERO SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY WELL IN BREAKING UP THE GREENSWARD AND BY THE TIME THAT THE MOON WAS A QUARTER OF HER JOURNEY UP THE SKY THE PLOWED FIELD LAY BEFORE HIM
4051-11218-0006 A LARGE TRACT OF BLACK EARTH READY TO BE SOWN WITH THE DRAGON'S TEETH SO JASON SCATTERED THEM BROADCAST AND HARROWED THEM INTO THE SOIL WITH A BRUSH HARROW AND TOOK HIS STAND ON THE EDGE OF THE FIELD ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT
4051-11218-0007 MUST WE WAIT LONG FOR HARVEST TIME HE INQUIRED OF MEDEA WHO WAS NOW STANDING BY HIS SIDE WHETHER SOONER OR LATER IT WILL BE SURE TO COME ANSWERED THE PRINCESS A CROP OF ARMED MEN NEVER FAILS TO SPRING UP WHEN THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN
4051-11218-0008 AND WHOLE MONTHS BEFORE THE YELLOW GRAIN WOULD BE RIPENED FOR THE SICKLE BUT BY AND BY ALL OVER THE FIELD
4051-11218-0009 LIKE SPARKLING DROPS OF DEW THESE BRIGHT OBJECTS SPROUTED HIGHER AND PROVED TO BE THE STEEL HEADS OF SPEARS THEN THERE WAS A DAZZLING GLEAM FROM A VAST NUMBER OF POLISHED BRASS HELMETS BENEATH WHICH AS THEY GREW FARTHER OUT OF THE SOIL
4051-11218-0010 TORE THEMSELVES UP BY THE ROOTS WHEREVER A DRAGON'S TOOTH HAD FALLEN THERE STOOD A MAN ARMED FOR BATTLE THEY MADE A CLANGOR WITH THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND EYED ONE ANOTHER FIERCELY
4051-11218-0011 FULL OF RAGE AND STORMY PASSIONS AND READY TO TAKE THE LIFE OF EVERY HUMAN BROTHER IN RECOMPENSE OF THE BOON OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE
4051-11218-0012 AND HOW IT WOULD HAVE REJOICED ANY GREAT CAPTAIN WHO WAS BENT ON CONQUERING THE WORLD LIKE ALEXANDER OR NAPOLEON TO RAISE A CROP OF ARMED SOLDIERS AS EASILY AS JASON DID
4051-11218-0013 CLASHING THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND BOILING OVER WITH THE RED HOT THIRST FOR BATTLE THEN THEY BEGAN TO SHOUT SHOW US THE ENEMY LEAD US TO THE CHARGE DEATH OR VICTORY COME ON BRAVE COMRADES CONQUER OR DIE
4051-11218-0014 AND A HUNDRED OTHER OUTCRIES SUCH AS MEN ALWAYS BELLOW FORTH ON A BATTLE FIELD AND WHICH THESE DRAGON PEOPLE SEEMED TO HAVE AT THEIR TONGUES ENDS AT LAST THE FRONT RANK CAUGHT SIGHT OF JASON WHO BEHOLDING THE FLASH OF SO MANY WEAPONS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4051-11218-0015 HAD THOUGHT IT BEST TO DRAW HIS SWORD IN A MOMENT ALL THE SONS OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH APPEARED TO TAKE JASON FOR AN ENEMY AND CRYING WITH ONE VOICE GUARD THE GOLDEN FLEECE THEY RAN AT HIM WITH UPLIFTED SWORDS AND PROTRUDED SPEARS
4051-11218-0016 THE ARMED MEN WERE NOW SO NIGH THAT JASON COULD DISCERN THE FIRE FLASHING OUT OF THEIR ENRAGED EYES WHEN HE LET FLY THE STONE AND SAW IT STRIKE THE HELMET OF A TALL WARRIOR WHO WAS RUSHING UPON HIM WITH HIS BLADE ALOFT
4051-11218-0017 AND INSTEAD OF RUNNING ANY FARTHER TOWARDS JASON THEY BEGAN TO FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES THE CONFUSION SPREAD THROUGH THE HOST
4051-11218-0018 HEWING AND STABBING AT ONE ANOTHER LOPPING OFF ARMS HEADS AND LEGS AND DOING SUCH MEMORABLE DEEDS THAT JASON WAS FILLED WITH IMMENSE ADMIRATION ALTHOUGH AT THE SAME TIME HE COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING TO BEHOLD THESE MIGHTY MEN PUNISHING EACH OTHER
4051-11218-0019 FOR AN OFFENSE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD COMMITTED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALMOST AS SHORT INDEED AS IT HAD TAKEN THEM TO GROW UP ALL BUT ONE OF THE HEROES OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH WERE STRETCHED LIFELESS ON THE FIELD
4051-11218-0020 THE LAST SURVIVOR THE BRAVEST AND STRONGEST OF THE WHOLE HAD JUST FORCE ENOUGH TO WAVE HIS CRIMSON SWORD OVER HIS HEAD AND GIVE A SHOUT OF EXULTATION CRYING VICTORY VICTORY IMMORTAL FAME
4051-11218-0021 WHEN HE HIMSELF FELL DOWN AND LAY QUIETLY AMONG HIS SLAIN BRETHREN AND THERE WAS THE END OF THE ARMY THAT HAD SPROUTED FROM THE DRAGON'S TEETH THAT FIERCE AND FEVERISH FIGHT WAS THE ONLY ENJOYMENT WHICH THEY HAD TASTED ON THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH
4051-11218-0022 LET THEM SLEEP IN THE BED OF HONOR SAID THE PRINCESS MEDEA WITH A SLY SMILE AT JASON THE WORLD WILL ALWAYS HAVE SIMPLETONS ENOUGH JUST LIKE THEM FIGHTING AND DYING FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT AND FANCYING THAT POSTERITY
4051-11218-0023 WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PUT LAUREL WREATHS ON THEIR RUSTY AND BATTERED HELMETS COULD YOU HELP SMILING PRINCE JASON TO SEE THE SELF CONCEIT OF THAT LAST FELLOW
4051-11218-0024 YOU WILL THINK DIFFERENTLY IN THE MORNING SAID MEDEA TRUE THE GOLDEN FLEECE MAY NOT BE SO VALUABLE AS YOU HAVE THOUGHT IT BUT THEN THERE IS NOTHING BETTER IN THE WORLD AND ONE MUST NEEDS HAVE AN OBJECT YOU KNOW COME YOUR NIGHT'S WORK HAS BEEN WELL PERFORMED
4051-11218-0025 THAT THE FIRST PART OF YOUR ALLOTTED TASK IS FULFILLED
4051-11218-0026 ENTERING THE PRESENCE CHAMBER HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE AND MADE A LOW OBEISANCE YOUR EYES LOOK HEAVY PRINCE JASON OBSERVED THE KING YOU APPEAR TO HAVE SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
4051-11218-0027 AND HAVE CONCLUDED NOT TO GET YOURSELF SCORCHED TO A CINDER IN ATTEMPTING TO TAME MY BRAZEN LUNGED BULLS
4051-11218-0028 THE FIELD HAS BEEN PLOWED THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN BROADCAST AND HARROWED INTO THE SOIL
4051-11218-0029 AND DEPART WITH MY NINE AND FORTY COMRADES
4051-11218-0030 AND LOOKED VERY ANGRY AND EXCESSIVELY DISTURBED FOR HE KNEW THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS KINGLY PROMISE HE OUGHT NOW TO PERMIT JASON TO WIN THE FLEECE IF HIS COURAGE AND SKILL SHOULD ENABLE HIM TO DO SO BUT SINCE THE YOUNG MAN HAD MET WITH SUCH GOOD LUCK IN THE MATTER OF THE BRAZEN BULLS
4051-11218-0031 AND THE DRAGON'S TEETH THE KING FEARED THAT HE WOULD BE EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN SLAYING THE DRAGON AND THEREFORE THOUGH HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE SEEN JASON SNAPPED UP AT A MOUTHFUL HE WAS RESOLVED AND IT WAS A VERY WRONG THING OF THIS WICKED POTENTATE
4051-11218-0032 NOT TO RUN ANY FURTHER RISK OF LOSING HIS BELOVED FLEECE YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS BUSINESS YOUNG MAN SAID HE IF MY UNDUTIFUL DAUGHTER MEDEA HAD NOT HELPED YOU WITH HER ENCHANTMENTS HAD YOU ACTED FAIRLY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THIS INSTANT
4051-11218-0033 TO SPEAK MY MIND PLAINLY YOU SHALL NEVER SET EYES ON SO MUCH AS ONE OF ITS GLISTENING LOCKS JASON LEFT THE KING'S PRESENCE IN GREAT SORROW AND ANGER HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BETTER
4051-11218-0034 MARCH AT ONCE TO THE GROVE OF MARS SLAY THE DRAGON TAKE POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE GET ON BOARD THE ARGO AND SPREAD ALL SAIL FOR IOLCHOS THE SUCCESS OF THIS SCHEME DEPENDED IT IS TRUE ON THE DOUBTFUL POINT
4051-11218-0035 AT SO MANY MOUTHFULS BY THE DRAGON BUT AS JASON WAS HASTENING DOWN THE PALACE STEPS
4051-11218-0036 AND ALTHOUGH SHE HAD DONE HIM SO MUCH SERVICE ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE HE WAS BY NO MEANS VERY CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULD NOT DO HIM AN EQUALLY GREAT MISCHIEF BEFORE SUNSET THESE ENCHANTRESSES YOU MUST KNOW ARE NEVER TO BE DEPENDED UPON
4051-11218-0037 WILL HE GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER RISK OR TROUBLE ON THE CONTRARY ANSWERED JASON HE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME FOR TAMING THE BRAZEN BULLS AND SOWING THE DRAGON'S TEETH
4051-11218-0038 AND HE FORBIDS ME TO MAKE ANY MORE ATTEMPTS AND POSITIVELY REFUSES TO GIVE UP THE GOLDEN FLEECE WHETHER I SLAY THE DRAGON OR NO YES JASON SAID THE PRINCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU MORE UNLESS YOU SET SAIL FROM COLCHIS
4051-11218-0039 STEALING THROUGH THE STREETS OF COLCHIS ON THEIR WAY TO THE SACRED GROVE
4051-11218-0040 LOWING NODDING THEIR HEADS AND THRUSTING FORTH THEIR SNOUTS WHICH AS OTHER CATTLE DO
4051-11218-0041 THEIR FIERCE NATURE WAS THOROUGHLY TAMED AND WITH THEIR FIERCENESS THE TWO FURNACES IN THEIR STOMACHS HAD LIKEWISE BEEN EXTINGUISHED
4051-11218-0042 THAN EVER BEFORE INDEED IT HAD HERETOFORE BEEN A GREAT INCONVENIENCE TO THESE POOR ANIMALS THAT WHENEVER THEY WISHED TO EAT A MOUTHFUL OF GRASS THE FIRE OUT OF THEIR NOSTRILS HAD SHRIVELED IT UP BEFORE THEY COULD MANAGE TO CROP IT
4051-11218-0043 HOW THEY CONTRIVED TO KEEP THEMSELVES ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE BUT NOW INSTEAD OF EMITTING JETS OF FLAME AND STREAMS OF SULPHUROUS VAPOR THEY BREATHED THE VERY SWEETEST OF COW BREATH AFTER KINDLY PATTING THE BULLS
4051-11218-0044 JASON FOLLOWED MEDEA'S GUIDANCE INTO THE GROVE OF MARS WHERE THE GREAT OAK TREES THAT HAD BEEN GROWING FOR CENTURIES THREW SO THICK A SHADE THAT THE MOONBEAMS STRUGGLED VAINLY TO FIND THEIR WAY THROUGH IT
4051-11218-0045 MEDEA SQUEEZED JASON'S HAND LOOK YONDER SHE WHISPERED DO YOU SEE IT GLEAMING AMONG THE VENERABLE OAKS THERE WAS A RADIANCE NOT LIKE THE MOONBEAMS BUT RATHER RESEMBLING THE GOLDEN GLORY OF THE SETTING SUN
4051-11218-0046 WHAT IS IT ASKED JASON HAVE YOU COME SO FAR TO SEEK IT
4051-11218-0047 WHEN IT GLITTERS BEFORE YOUR EYES IT IS THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON WENT ONWARD A FEW STEPS FARTHER AND THEN STOPPED TO GAZE O HOW BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKED SHINING WITH A MARVELOUS LIGHT OF ITS OWN THAT
4051-11218-0048 PRIZE WHICH SO MANY HEROES HAD LONGED TO BEHOLD BUT HAD PERISHED IN THE QUEST OF IT EITHER BY THE PERILS OF THEIR VOYAGE OR BY THE FIERY BREATH OF THE BRAZEN LUNGED BULLS HOW GLORIOUSLY IT SHINES CRIED JASON IN A RAPTURE IT
4051-11218-0049 THE TERRIBLE DRAGON HAD QUITE SLIPPED OUT OF JASON'S MEMORY SOON HOWEVER SOMETHING CAME TO PASS THAT REMINDED HIM WHAT PERILS WERE STILL TO BE ENCOUNTERED AN ANTELOPE THAT PROBABLY MISTOOK THE YELLOW RADIANCE FOR SUNRISE CAME
4051-11218-0050 FOR HE WAS TWISTED ROUND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE ON WHICH THE FLEECE HUNG AND SEIZING THE POOR ANTELOPE SWALLOWED HIM WITH ONE SNAP OF HIS JAWS AFTER THIS FEAT THE DRAGON SEEMED SENSIBLE THAT SOME OTHER LIVING CREATURE WAS WITHIN REACH
4051-11218-0051 ON WHICH HE FELT INCLINED TO FINISH HIS MEAL IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS HE KEPT POKING HIS UGLY SNOUT AMONG THE TREES STRETCHING OUT HIS NECK A TERRIBLE LONG WAY NOW HERE
4051-11218-0052 UPON MY WORD AS THE HEAD CAME WAVING AND UNDULATING THROUGH THE AIR AND REACHING ALMOST WITHIN ARM'S LENGTH OF PRINCE JASON IT WAS A VERY HIDEOUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE SIGHT
4051-11218-0053 THE GAPE OF HIS ENORMOUS JAWS WAS NEARLY AS WIDE AS THE GATEWAY OF THE KING'S PALACE WELL JASON WHISPERED MEDEA FOR SHE WAS ILL NATURED AS ALL ENCHANTRESSES ARE AND WANTED TO MAKE THE BOLD YOUTH TREMBLE
