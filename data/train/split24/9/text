3486-166424-0000 AS I GAZED UPON THEM I WONDERED TO WHAT SECRET PLACE WITHIN THEIR BROODING IMMENSITIES THE LITTLE METAL MYSTERIES HAD FLED AND TO WHAT MYRIADS IT MIGHT BE OF THEIR KIND
3486-166424-0001 OF WHAT POWERS SMALL LIKE THESE OR OR QUICK ON THE SCREEN OF MY MIND FLASHED TWO PICTURES SIDE BY SIDE
3486-166424-0002 THE LITTLE FOUR RAYED PRINT IN THE GREAT DUST OF THE CRUMBLING RUIN AND ITS COLOSSAL TWIN ON THE BREAST OF THE POPPIED VALLEY I TURNED ASIDE CREPT THROUGH THE SHATTERED PORTAL AND LOOKED OVER THE HAUNTED HOLLOW UNBELIEVING I RUBBED MY EYES
3486-166424-0003 THEN LEAPED TO THE VERY BRIM OF THE BOWL A LARK HAD RISEN FROM THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE SHATTERED HEAPS AND HAD FLOWN CAROLING UP INTO THE SHADOWY SKY A FLOCK OF THE LITTLE WILLOW WARBLERS FLUNG THEMSELVES ACROSS THE VALLEY SCOLDING AND GOSSIPING
3486-166424-0004 A HARE SAT UPRIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANCIENT ROADWAY THE VALLEY ITSELF LAY SERENELY UNDER THE AMBERING LIGHT SMILING PEACEFUL EMPTIED OF HORROR
3486-166424-0005 I DROPPED OVER THE SIDE WALKED CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE ROAD UP WHICH BUT AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE WE HAD STRUGGLED SO DESPERATELY PACED FARTHER AND FARTHER WITH AN INCREASING CONFIDENCE AND A GROWING WONDER
3486-166424-0006 GONE WAS THAT SOUL OF LONELINESS VANISHED THE WHIRLPOOL OF DESPAIR THAT HAD STRIVEN TO DRAG US DOWN TO DEATH THE BOWL WAS NOTHING BUT A QUIET SMILING LOVELY LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE HILLS I LOOKED BACK
3486-166424-0007 EVEN THE RUINS HAD LOST THEIR SINISTER SHAPE WERE TIME WORN CRUMBLING PILES NOTHING MORE
3486-166424-0008 A RIFLE SHOT RANG OUT ABOVE US ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FROM THE PORTAL SCAMPERED CHIU MING HIS ROBE TUCKED UP ABOUT HIS KNEES THEY COME HE GASPED THEY COME
3486-166424-0009 DOWN IT WAS POURING AN AVALANCHE OF MEN I CAUGHT THE GLINT OF HELMETS AND CORSELETS THOSE IN THE VAN WERE MOUNTED GALLOPING TWO ABREAST UPON SURE FOOTED MOUNTAIN PONIES THEIR SHORT SWORDS LIFTED HIGH FLICKERED
3486-166424-0010 AFTER THE HORSEMEN SWARMED FOOT SOLDIERS A FOREST OF SHINING POINTS AND DULLY GLEAMING PIKES ABOVE THEM CLEARLY TO US CAME THEIR BATTLECRIES AGAIN VENTNOR'S RIFLE CRACKED ONE OF THE FOREMOST RIDERS WENT DOWN ANOTHER STUMBLED OVER HIM FELL
3486-166424-0011 THE RUSH WAS CHECKED FOR AN INSTANT MILLING UPON THE ROAD DICK I CRIED RUSH RUTH OVER TO THE TUNNEL MOUTH WE'LL FOLLOW WE CAN HOLD THEM THERE I'LL GET MARTIN CHIU MING AFTER THE PONY QUICK I PUSHED THE TWO OVER THE RIM OF THE HOLLOW
3486-166424-0012 QUICK MART I SHOUTED UP THE SHATTERED STAIRWAY WE CAN GET THROUGH THE HOLLOW RUTH AND DRAKE ARE ON THEIR WAY TO THE BREAK WE CAME THROUGH HURRY ALL RIGHT JUST A MINUTE HE CALLED I HEARD HIM EMPTY HIS MAGAZINE WITH ALMOST MACHINE GUN QUICKNESS
3486-166424-0013 ALL MY AMMUNITION IS ON HIM CHIU MING'S TAKING CARE OF THAT I GASPED WE DARTED OUT OF THE GATEWAY A GOOD FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY WERE RUTH AND DRAKE RUNNING STRAIGHT TO THE GREEN TUNNEL'S MOUTH BETWEEN THEM AND US WAS CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY
3486-166424-0014 AS WE SPED AFTER HIM I LOOKED BACK THE HORSEMEN HAD RECOVERED WERE NOW A SCANT HALF MILE FROM WHERE THE ROAD SWEPT PAST THE FORTRESS I SAW THAT WITH THEIR SWORDS THE HORSEMEN BORE GREAT BOWS A LITTLE CLOUD OF ARROWS SPARKLED FROM THEM
3486-166424-0015 FELL FAR SHORT DON'T LOOK BACK GRUNTED VENTNOR STRETCH YOURSELF WALTER THERE'S A SURPRISE COMING HOPE TO GOD I JUDGED THE TIME RIGHT WE TURNED OFF THE RUINED WAY
3486-166424-0016 HE REACHED OUT TOUCHED ME YOU'RE RIGHT WALTER HE GRINNED IT DOES SEEM LIKE CARRYING COALS TO NEWCASTLE
3486-166424-0017 SCATTERED PRONE AMONG THESE WERE MEN AND HORSES OTHERS STAGGERED SCREAMING ON THE FARTHER SIDE OF THIS STONY DIKE OUR PURSUERS WERE HELD LIKE RUSHING WATERS BEHIND A SUDDEN FALLEN TREE TIMED TO A SECOND CRIED VENTNOR HOLD EM FOR A WHILE
3486-166424-0018 AND HOLDING RUTH BY THE HAND RACE BACK TOWARD US EVEN AS HE TURNED THE VINE SCREENED ENTRANCE THROUGH WHICH WE HAD COME THROUGH WHICH WE HAD THOUGHT LAY SAFETY STREAMED OTHER ARMORED MEN WE WERE OUTFLANKED TO THE FISSURE SHOUTED VENTNOR
3486-166424-0019 DRAKE HEARD FOR HE CHANGED HIS COURSE TO THE CREVICE AT WHOSE MOUTH RUTH HAD SAID THE LITTLE THINGS HAD LAIN AFTER HIM STREAKED CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY SHOUTING OUT OF THE TUNNEL DOWN OVER THE LIP OF THE BOWL LEAPED THE SOLDIERS
3486-166424-0020 WE DROPPED UPON OUR KNEES SENT SHOT AFTER SHOT INTO THEM THEY FELL BACK HESITATED WE SPRANG UP SPED ON ALL TOO SHORT WAS THE CHECK BUT ONCE MORE WE HELD THEM AND AGAIN NOW RUTH AND DICK WERE A SCANT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE CREVICE I SAW HIM STOP
3486-166424-0021 PUSH HER FROM HIM TOWARD IT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NOW CHIU MING WAS WITH THEM RUTH SPRANG TO THE PONY LIFTED FROM ITS BACK A RIFLE THEN INTO THE MASS OF THEIR PURSUERS DRAKE AND SHE POURED A FUSILLADE THEY HUDDLED WAVERED BROKE FOR COVER
3486-166424-0022 A CHANCE GASPED VENTNOR BEHIND US WAS A WOLFLIKE YELPING THE FIRST PACK HAD RE FORMED HAD CROSSED THE BARRICADE THE DYNAMITE HAD MADE WAS RUSHING UPON US I RAN AS I HAD NEVER KNOWN I COULD

3486-166424-0024 NATURE'S SUMMONING OF EVERY RESERVE TO MEET THAT PERIL MY EYES TOOK THEM IN WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC NICETY THE LINKED MAIL LACQUERED BLUE AND SCARLET OF THE HORSEMEN BROWN PADDED ARMOR OF THE FOOTMEN
3486-166424-0025 THEIR BOWS AND JAVELINS AND SHORT BRONZE SWORDS THEIR PIKES AND SHIELDS AND UNDER THEIR ROUND HELMETS THEIR CRUEL BEARDED FACES WHITE AS OUR OWN WHERE THE BLACK BEARDS DID NOT COVER THEM THEIR FIERCE AND MOCKING EYES
3486-166424-0026 IN THIS WORLD OF OURS TWENTY CENTURIES BEYOND THEIR TIME SWIFTLY ACCURATELY EVEN AS I SCANNED THEM WE HAD BEEN DRILLING INTO THEM THEY ADVANCED DELIBERATELY HEEDLESS OF THEIR FALLEN THEIR ARROWS HAD CEASED TO FLY
3486-166424-0027 I WONDERED WHY FOR NOW WE WERE WELL WITHIN THEIR RANGE
3486-166424-0028 WE'VE SAVED RUTH ANYWAY HE SAID DRAKE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THAT HOLE IN THE WALL HE'S GOT LOTS OF AMMUNITION ON THE PONY BUT THEY'VE GOT US ANOTHER WILD SHOUTING DOWN SWEPT THE PACK
3486-166424-0029 WE LEAPED TO OUR FEET SENT OUR LAST BULLETS INTO THEM STOOD READY RIFLES CLUBBED TO MEET THE RUSH I HEARD RUTH SCREAM WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THE ARMORED MEN WHY HAD THEY HALTED
3486-166424-0030 WHAT WAS IT AT WHICH THEY WERE GLARING OVER OUR HEADS AND WHY HAD THE RIFLE FIRE OF RUTH AND DRAKE CEASED SO ABRUPTLY SIMULTANEOUSLY WE TURNED WITHIN THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF THE FISSURE STOOD A SHAPE AN APPARITION
3486-166424-0031 A WOMAN BEAUTIFUL AWESOME INCREDIBLE SHE WAS TALL STANDING THERE SWATHED FROM CHIN TO FEET IN CLINGING VEILS OF PALE AMBER SHE SEEMED TALLER EVEN THAN TALL DRAKE
3486-166424-0032 YET IT WAS NOT HER HEIGHT THAT SENT THROUGH ME THE THRILL OF AWE OF HALF INCREDULOUS TERROR WHICH RELAXING MY GRIP LET MY SMOKING RIFLE DROP TO EARTH NOR WAS IT THAT ABOUT HER PROUD HEAD A CLOUD OF SHINING TRESSES SWIRLED AND PENNONED
3486-166424-0033 LIKE A MISTY BANNER OF WOVEN COPPER FLAMES NO NOR THAT THROUGH HER VEILS HER BODY GLEAMED FAINT RADIANCE IT WAS HER EYES HER GREAT WIDE EYES WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS WERE LIKE POOLS OF LIVING STAR FIRES
3486-166424-0034 THEY SHONE FROM HER WHITE FACE NOT PHOSPHORESCENT NOT MERELY LUCENT AND LIGHT REFLECTING BUT AS THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES WERE SOURCES OF THE COLD WHITE FLAMES OF FAR STARS AND AS CALM AS THOSE STARS THEMSELVES
3486-166424-0035 AND IN THAT FACE ALTHOUGH AS YET I COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT THE EYES I SENSED SOMETHING UNEARTHLY GOD WHISPERED VENTNOR WHAT IS SHE
3486-166424-0036 THE WOMAN STEPPED FROM THE CREVICE NOT FIFTY FEET FROM HER WERE RUTH AND DRAKE AND CHIU MING THEIR RIGID ATTITUDES REVEALING THE SAME SHOCK OF AWE THAT HAD MOMENTARILY PARALYZED ME SHE LOOKED AT THEM BECKONED THEM
3486-166424-0037 I SAW THE TWO WALK TOWARD HER CHIU MING HANG BACK THE GREAT EYES FELL UPON VENTNOR AND MYSELF SHE RAISED A HAND MOTIONED US TO APPROACH I TURNED THERE STOOD THE HOST THAT HAD POURED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ROAD
3486-166424-0038 HORSEMEN SPEARSMEN PIKEMEN A FULL THOUSAND OF THEM AT MY RIGHT WERE THE SCATTERED COMPANY THAT HAD COME FROM THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE THREESCORE OR MORE THERE SEEMED A SPELL UPON THEM
3486-166424-0039 THEY STOOD IN SILENCE LIKE AUTOMATONS ONLY THEIR FIERCELY STARING EYES SHOWING THAT THEY WERE ALIVE QUICK BREATHED VENTNOR WE RAN TOWARD HER WHO HAD CHECKED DEATH EVEN WHILE ITS JAWS WERE CLOSING UPON US
3486-166424-0040 BEFORE WE HAD GONE HALF WAY AS THOUGH OUR FLIGHT HAD BROKEN WHATEVER BONDS HAD BOUND THEM A CLAMOR AROSE FROM THE HOST A WILD SHOUTING A CLANGING OF SWORDS ON SHIELDS I SHOT A GLANCE BEHIND THEY WERE IN MOTION ADVANCING SLOWLY
3486-166424-0041 HESITATINGLY AS YET BUT I KNEW THAT SOON THAT HESITATION WOULD PASS THAT THEY WOULD SWEEP DOWN UPON US ENGULF US TO THE CREVICE I SHOUTED TO DRAKE HE PAID NO HEED TO ME NOR DID RUTH
3486-166424-0042 THEIR GAZE FASTENED UPON THE SWATHED WOMAN VENTNOR'S HAND SHOT OUT GRIPPED MY SHOULDER HALTED ME SHE HAD THROWN UP HER HEAD
3486-166424-0043 FROM THE LIFTED THROAT CAME A LOW A VIBRANT CRY HARMONIOUS WEIRDLY DISQUIETING GOLDEN AND SWEET AND LADEN WITH THE EERY MINOR WAILINGS OF THE BLUE VALLEY'S NIGHT THE DRAGONED CHAMBER
3486-166424-0044 BEFORE THE CRY HAD CEASED THERE POURED WITH INCREDIBLE SWIFTNESS OUT OF THE CREVICE SCORE UPON SCORE OF THE METAL THINGS THE FISSURES VOMITED THEM
3486-166424-0045 GLOBES AND CUBES AND PYRAMIDS NOT SMALL LIKE THOSE OF THE RUINS BUT SHAPES ALL OF FOUR FEET HIGH DULLY LUSTROUS AND DEEP WITHIN THAT LUSTER THE MYRIADS OF TINY POINTS OF LIGHT LIKE UNWINKING STARING EYES
3486-166424-0046 THEY SWIRLED EDDIED AND FORMED A BARRICADE BETWEEN US AND THE ARMORED MEN DOWN UPON THEM POURED A SHOWER OF ARROWS FROM THE SOLDIERS I HEARD THE SHOUTS OF THEIR CAPTAINS THEY RUSHED THEY HAD COURAGE THOSE MEN YES AGAIN CAME THE WOMAN'S CRY
3486-166424-0047 UP FROM THEM THRUST A THICK RECTANGULAR COLUMN
3486-166424-0048 EIGHT FEET IN WIDTH AND TWENTY FEET HIGH IT SHAPED ITSELF OUT FROM ITS LEFT SIDE FROM RIGHT SIDE SPRANG ARMS FEARFUL ARMS THAT GREW AND GREW AS GLOBE AND CUBE AND ANGLE RACED UP THE COLUMN'S SIDE AND CLICKED INTO PLACE EACH UPON EACH AFTER THE OTHER
3486-166424-0049 WITH MAGICAL QUICKNESS THE ARMS LENGTHENED BEFORE US STOOD A MONSTROUS SHAPE A GEOMETRIC PRODIGY
3486-166424-0050 A SHINING ANGLED PILLAR THAT THOUGH RIGID IMMOBILE SEEMED TO CROUCH BE INSTINCT WITH LIVING FORCE STRIVING TO BE UNLEASHED TWO GREAT GLOBES SURMOUNTED IT
3486-166424-0051 FLEXING THEMSELVES IN GROTESQUE IMITATION OF A BOXER
3486-166424-0052 AGAIN IN GIGANTIC AWFUL PARODY OF THE SPIKED GLOVES OF THOSE ANCIENT GLADIATORS WHO FOUGHT FOR IMPERIAL NERO
3486-166424-0053 PREENING TESTING ITSELF LIKE AN ATHLETE
3486-166424-0054 UNDER THE DARKENING SKY IN THE GREEN OF THE HOLLOW THE ARMORED HOSTS FROZEN BEFORE IT AND THEN IT STRUCK OUT FLASHED TWO OF THE ARMS WITH A GLANCING MOTION WITH APPALLING FORCE
3486-166424-0055 THEY SLICED INTO THE CLOSE PACKED FORWARD RANKS OF THE ARMORED MEN CUT OUT OF THEM TWO GREAT GAPS SICKENED I SAW FRAGMENTS OF MAN AND HORSE FLY ANOTHER ARM JAVELINED FROM ITS PLACE LIKE A FLYING SNAKE CLICKED AT THE END OF ANOTHER
3486-166424-0056 BECAME A HUNDRED FOOT CHAIN WHICH SWIRLED LIKE A FLAIL THROUGH THE HUDDLING MASS DOWN UPON A KNOT OF THE SOLDIERS WITH A STRAIGHT FORWARD BLOW DROVE A THIRD ARM DRIVING THROUGH THEM LIKE A GIANT PUNCH
3486-166424-0057 ALL THAT HOST WHICH HAD DRIVEN US FROM THE RUINS THREW DOWN SWORD SPEAR AND PIKE FLED SHRIEKING THE HORSEMEN SPURRED THEIR MOUNTS RIDING HEEDLESS OVER THE FOOTMEN WHO FLED WITH THEM THE SMITING THING SEEMED TO WATCH THEM GO
3486-166424-0058 WITH AMUSEMENT BEFORE THEY COULD COVER A HUNDRED YARDS IT HAD DISINTEGRATED I HEARD THE LITTLE WAILING SOUNDS THEN BEHIND THE FLEEING MEN CLOSE BEHIND THEM ROSE THE ANGLED PILLAR INTO PLACE SPRANG THE FLEXING ARMS AND AGAIN IT TOOK ITS TOLL OF THEM
3486-166424-0059 THEY SCATTERED RUNNING SINGLY BY TWOS IN LITTLE GROUPS FOR THE SIDES OF THE VALLEY THEY WERE LIKE RATS SCAMPERING IN PANIC OVER THE BOTTOM OF A GREAT GREEN BOWL AND LIKE A MONSTROUS CAT THE SHAPE PLAYED WITH THEM YES PLAYED
3486-166424-0060 IT MELTED ONCE MORE TOOK NEW FORM WHERE HAD BEEN PILLAR AND FLAILING ARMS WAS NOW A TRIPOD THIRTY FEET HIGH ITS LEGS ALTERNATE GLOBE AND CUBE AND UPON ITS APEX A WIDE AND SPINNING RING OF SPARKLING SPHERES
3486-166424-0061 OUT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THIS RING STRETCHED A TENTACLE WRITHING UNDULATING LIKE A SERPENT OF STEEL FOUR SCORE YARDS AT LEAST IN LENGTH
3486-166424-0062 WITH THE THREE LONG PRONGS OF THIS TRIDENT THE THING STRUCK SWIFTLY
3486-166424-0063 IT WAS I THINK THAT LAST TOUCH OF SHEER HORROR THE PLAYFULNESS OF THE SMITING THING THAT SENT MY DRY TONGUE TO THE ROOF OF MY TERROR PARCHED MOUTH AND HELD OPEN WITH MONSTROUS FASCINATION EYES THAT STRUGGLED TO CLOSE
3486-166424-0064 EVER THE ARMORED MEN FLED FROM IT AND EVER WAS IT SWIFTER THAN THEY TEETERING AT THEIR HEELS ON ITS TRIPOD LEGS FROM HALF ITS LENGTH THE DARTING SNAKE STREAMED RED RAIN I HEARD A SIGH FROM RUTH
3486-166424-0065 WRESTED MY GAZE FROM THE HOLLOW TURNED SHE LAY FAINTING IN DRAKE'S ARMS BESIDE THE TWO THE SWATHED WOMAN STOOD LOOKING OUT UPON THAT SLAUGHTER CALM AND STILL SHROUDED WITH AN UNEARTHLY TRANQUILLITY
3486-166424-0066 VIEWING IT IT CAME TO ME WITH EYES IMPERSONAL COLD INDIFFERENT AS THE UNTROUBLED STARS WHICH LOOK DOWN UPON HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE IN THIS WORLD OF OURS THERE WAS A RUSHING OF MANY FEET AT OUR LEFT A WAIL FROM CHIU MING
3486-166424-0067 WERE THEY MADDENED BY FEAR DRIVEN BY DESPAIR DETERMINED TO SLAY BEFORE THEY THEMSELVES WERE SLAIN I DO NOT KNOW BUT THOSE WHO STILL LIVED OF THE MEN FROM THE TUNNEL MOUTH WERE CHARGING US THEY CLUSTERED CLOSE THEIR SHIELDS HELD BEFORE THEM
3486-166424-0068 THEY HAD NO BOWS THESE MEN THEY MOVED SWIFTLY DOWN UPON US IN SILENCE SWORDS AND PIKES GLEAMING THE SMITING THING ROCKED TOWARD US THE METAL TENTACLE STRAINING OUT LIKE A RIGID RACING SERPENT FLYING TO CUT BETWEEN ITS WEIRD MISTRESS AND THOSE WHO MENACED HER
3486-166424-0069 I HEARD CHIU MING SCREAM SAW HIM THROW UP HIS HANDS COVER HIS EYES RUN STRAIGHT UPON THE PIKES CHIU MING I SHOUTED CHIU MING THIS WAY I RAN TOWARD HIM
3486-166424-0070 I SAW A SPEAR THROWN IT STRUCK THE CHINAMAN SQUARELY IN THE BREAST HE TOTTERED FELL UPON HIS KNEES EVEN AS HE DROPPED THE GIANT FLAIL SWEPT DOWN UPON THE SOLDIERS IT SWEPT THROUGH THEM LIKE A SCYTHE THROUGH RIPE GRAIN
3486-166424-0071 IT THREW THEM BROKEN AND TORN FAR TOWARD THE VALLEY'S SLOPING SIDES IT LEFT ONLY FRAGMENTS THAT BORE NO SEMBLANCE TO MEN VENTNOR WAS AT CHIU MING'S HEAD I DROPPED BESIDE HIM THERE WAS A CRIMSON FROTH UPON HIS LIPS
3486-166424-0072 I THOUGHT THAT SHIN JE WAS ABOUT TO SLAY US HE WHISPERED FEAR BLINDED ME HIS HEAD DROPPED HIS BODY QUIVERED LAY STILL WE AROSE LOOKED ABOUT US DAZEDLY
3486-166424-0073 AT THE SIDE OF THE CREVICE STOOD THE WOMAN HER GAZE RESTING UPON DRAKE HIS ARMS ABOUT RUTH HER HEAD HIDDEN ON HIS BREAST THE VALLEY WAS EMPTY SAVE FOR THE HUDDLED HEAPS THAT DOTTED IT
3486-166424-0074 HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN PATH A SCORE OF FIGURES CREPT ALL THAT WERE LEFT OF THOSE WHO BUT A LITTLE BEFORE HAD STREAMED DOWN TO TAKE US CAPTIVE OR TO SLAY
3486-166424-0075 HIGH UP IN THE DARKENING HEAVENS THE LAMMERGEIERS THE WINGED SCAVENGERS OF THE HIMALAYAS WERE GATHERING THE WOMAN LIFTED HER HAND BECKONED US ONCE MORE SLOWLY WE WALKED TOWARD HER STOOD BEFORE HER
3486-166446-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE DRUMS OF DESTINY SLOWLY WE DESCENDED THAT MOUNT OF DESOLATION LINGERINGLY AS THOUGH THE BROODING EYES OF NORHALA WERE NOT YET SATED WITH DESTRUCTION
3486-166446-0001 OF HUMAN LIFE OF GREEN LIFE OF LIFE OF ANY KIND THERE WAS NONE
3486-166446-0002 PALACE TEMPLE AND HOME NORHALA HAD STAMPED FLAT SHE HAD CRUSHED THEM WITHIN THE ROCK EVEN AS SHE HAD PROMISED THE TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY HAD ABSORBED MY EVERY FACULTY
3486-166446-0003 NOW IN THE PAINFUL SURGES OF AWAKENING REALIZATION OF FULL HUMAN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT INHUMAN ANNIHILATION I TURNED TO THEM FOR STRENGTH FAINTLY I WONDERED AGAIN AT RUTH'S SCANTINESS OF GARB HER MORE THAN HALF NUDITY
3486-166446-0004 DWELT CURIOUSLY UPON THE RED BRAND ACROSS VENTNOR'S FOREHEAD
3486-166446-0005 BUT IN THE EYES OF RUTH WAS NONE OF THIS STERNLY COLDLY TRIUMPHANT INDIFFERENT TO ITS PITEOUSNESS AS NORHALA HERSELF SHE SCANNED THE WASTE THAT LESS THAN AN HOUR SINCE HAD BEEN A PLACE OF LIVING BEAUTY I FELT A SHOCK OF REPULSION AFTER ALL
3486-166446-0006 YET MOTHER AND BLOSSOMING MAID YOUTH AND OLDSTER ALL THE PAGEANT OF HUMANITY WITHIN THE GREAT WALLS WERE NOW BUT LINES WITHIN THE STONE ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT LIGHTS IT CAME TO ME THERE HAD BEEN
3486-166446-0007 FROM NORHALA OF COURSE I LOOKED FOR NO PERCEPTION OF ANY OF THIS BUT FROM RUTH MY REACTION GREW
3486-166446-0008 THERE WAS DRIED BLOOD ON THE EDGES A DOUBLE RING OF SWOLLEN WHITE FLESH RIMMING THE CINCTURE IT WAS THE MARK OF TORTURE MARTIN I CRIED THAT RING WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU THEY WAKED ME WITH THAT HE ANSWERED QUIETLY
3486-166446-0009 I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL ALTHOUGH THEIR INTENTIONS WERE NOT EXACTLY THERAPEUTIC THEY TORTURED HIM RUTH'S VOICE WAS TENSE BITTER SHE SPOKE IN PERSIAN FOR NORHALA'S BENEFIT I THOUGHT THEN NOT GUESSING A DEEPER REASON
3486-166446-0010 THEY TORTURED HIM THEY GAVE HIM AGONY UNTIL HE RETURNED AND THEY PROMISED HIM OTHER AGONIES THAT WOULD MAKE HIM PRAY LONG FOR DEATH AND ME ME SHE RAISED LITTLE CLENCHED HANDS
3486-166446-0011 ME THEY STRIPPED LIKE A SLAVE THEY LED ME THROUGH THE CITY AND THE PEOPLE MOCKED ME
3486-166446-0012 BEFORE MY EYES THEY TORTURED MY BROTHER NORHALA THEY WERE EVIL ALL EVIL NORHALA YOU DID WELL TO SLAY THEM SHE CAUGHT THE WOMAN'S HANDS PRESSED CLOSE TO HER
3486-166446-0013 NORHALA GAZED AT HER FROM GREAT GRAY EYES IN WHICH THE WRATH WAS DYING INTO WHICH THE OLD TRANQUILLITY THE OLD SERENITY WAS FLOWING AND WHEN SHE SPOKE THE GOLDEN VOICE HELD MORE THAN RETURNING ECHOES OF THE FAR AWAY FAINT CHIMINGS IT IS DONE SHE SAID
3486-166446-0014 AND IT WAS WELL DONE SISTER NOW YOU AND I SHALL DWELL TOGETHER IN PEACE SISTER OR IF THERE BE THOSE IN THE WORLD FROM WHICH YOU CAME THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SLAIN
3486-166446-0015 THEN YOU AND I SHALL GO FORTH WITH OUR COMPANIES AND STAMP THEM OUT EVEN AS I DID THESE MY HEART STOPPED BEATING FOR FROM THE DEPTHS OF RUTH'S EYES SHINING SHADOWS WERE RISING WRAITHS ANSWERING NORHALA'S CALLING
3486-166446-0016 AND AS THEY ROSE STEADILY THEY DREW LIFE FROM THE CLEAR RADIANCE SUMMONING DREW CLOSER TO THE SEMBLANCE OF THAT TRANQUIL SPIRIT WHICH HER VENGEANCE HAD BANISHED
3486-166446-0017 AND AT LAST IT WAS TWIN SISTER OF NORHALA WHO LOOKED UPON HER FROM THE FACE OF RUTH THE WHITE ARMS OF THE WOMAN ENCIRCLED HER THE GLORIOUS HEAD BENT OVER HER FLAMING TRESSES MINGLED WITH TENDER BROWN CURLS
3486-166446-0018 SISTER SHE WHISPERED LITTLE SISTER THESE MEN YOU SHALL HAVE AS LONG AS IT PLEASES YOU TO DO WITH AS YOU WILL OR IF IT IS YOUR WISH THEY SHALL GO BACK TO THEIR WORLD AND I WILL GUARD THEM TO ITS GATES
3486-166446-0019 BUT YOU AND I LITTLE SISTER WILL DWELL TOGETHER IN THE VASTNESSES IN THE PEACE SHALL IT NOT BE SO WITH NO FALTERING WITH NO GLANCE TOWARD US THREE
3486-166446-0020 LOVER BROTHER OLD FRIEND RUTH CREPT CLOSER TO HER RESTED HER HEAD UPON THE VIRGINAL ROYAL BREASTS IT SHALL BE SO SHE MURMURED SISTER IT SHALL BE SO NORHALA I AM TIRED NORHALA I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF MEN
3486-166446-0021 AN ECSTASY OF TENDERNESS A FLAME OF UNEARTHLY RAPTURE TREMBLED OVER THE WOMAN'S WONDROUS FACE HUNGRILY DEFIANTLY SHE PRESSED THE GIRL TO HER THE STARS IN THE LUCID HEAVENS OF HER EYES WERE SOFT AND GENTLE AND CARESSING
3486-166446-0022 RUTH CRIED DRAKE AND SPRANG TOWARD THEM SHE PAID NO HEED AND EVEN AS HE LEAPED HE WAS CAUGHT WHIRLED BACK AGAINST US WAIT SAID VENTNOR
3486-166446-0023 THERE WAS A CURIOUS UNDERSTANDING IN HIS VOICE A CURIOUS SYMPATHY TOO IN THE PATIENT UNTROUBLED GAZE THAT DWELT UPON HIS SISTER AND THIS WEIRDLY EXQUISITE WOMAN WHO HELD HER WAIT EXCLAIMED DRAKE WAIT HELL THE DAMNED WITCH IS STEALING HER AWAY FROM US
3486-166446-0024 AGAIN HE THREW HIMSELF FORWARD RECOILED AS THOUGH SWEPT BACK BY AN INVISIBLE ARM FELL AGAINST US AND WAS CLASPED AND HELD BY VENTNOR AND AS HE STRUGGLED THE THING WE RODE HALTED
3486-166446-0025 LIKE METAL WAVES BACK INTO IT RUSHED THE ENIGMATIC BILLOWS THAT HAD WASHED OVER THE FRAGMENTS OF THE CITY WE WERE LIFTED BETWEEN US AND THE WOMAN AND GIRL A CLEFT APPEARED IT WIDENED INTO A RIFT
3486-166446-0026 IT WAS AS THOUGH NORHALA HAD DECREED IT AS A SYMBOL OF THIS HER SECOND VICTORY OR HAD SET IT BETWEEN US AS A BARRIER WIDER GREW THE RIFT
3486-166446-0027 SAVE FOR THE BRIDGE OF OUR VOICES IT SEPARATED US FROM RUTH AS THOUGH SHE STOOD UPON ANOTHER WORLD HIGHER WE ROSE THE THREE OF US NOW UPON THE FLAT TOP OF A TOWER UPON WHOSE COUNTERPART FIFTY FEET AWAY
3486-166446-0028 QUIETLY IT GLIDED TO THE CHASM IT HAD BLASTED IN THE CLIFF WALL THE SHADOW OF THOSE WALLS FELL UPON US AS ONE WE LOOKED BACK AS ONE WE SEARCHED OUT THE PATCH OF BLUE WITH THE BLACK BLOT AT ITS BREAST WE FOUND IT THEN THE PRECIPICES HID IT
3486-166446-0029 SILENTLY WE STREAMED THROUGH THE CHASM THROUGH THE CANYON AND THE TUNNEL SPEAKING NO WORD DRAKE'S EYES FIXED WITH BITTER HATRED UPON NORHALA VENTNOR BROODING UPON HER ALWAYS WITH THAT ENIGMATIC SYMPATHY WE PASSED BETWEEN THE WALLS OF THE FURTHER CLEFT
3486-166446-0030 STOOD FOR AN INSTANT AT THE BRINK OF THE GREEN FOREST THERE CAME TO US AS THOUGH FROM IMMEASURABLE DISTANCES A FAINT SUSTAINED THRUMMING LIKE THE BEATING OF COUNTLESS MUFFLED DRUMS THE THING THAT CARRIED US TREMBLED THE SOUND DIED AWAY
3486-166446-0031 THE THING QUIETED IT BEGAN ITS STEADY EFFORTLESS STRIDING THROUGH THE CROWDING TREES BUT NOW WITH NONE OF THAT SPEED WITH WHICH IT HAD COME SPURRED FORWARD BY NORHALA'S AWAKENED HATE VENTNOR STIRRED
3486-166446-0032 PURGED NOT ONLY BY SUFFERING BUT BY IT CAME TO ME SOME STRANGE KNOWLEDGE NO USE DRAKE HE SAID DREAMILY
3486-166446-0033 BUT THIS I DO KNOW ONLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER CAN THE BALANCE FALL AND IF IT BE ONE WAY THEN YOU AND WE SHALL HAVE RUTH BACK AND IF IT FALLS THE OTHER WAY THEN THERE WILL BE LITTLE NEED FOR US TO CARE FOR MAN WILL BE DONE MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN
3486-166446-0034 IT IS THE CRISIS HE ANSWERED WE CAN DO NOTHING GOODWIN NOTHING WHATEVER IS TO BE STEPS FORTH NOW FROM THE WOMB OF DESTINY AGAIN THERE CAME THAT DISTANT ROLLING LOUDER NOW AGAIN THE THING TREMBLED
3486-166446-0035 IS IT TAPS FOR THEM THE DRUMMING DIED AS I LISTENED FEARFULLY ABOUT US WAS ONLY THE SWISHING THE SIGHING OF THE FALLING TREES BENEATH THE TREAD OF THE THING MOTIONLESS STOOD NORHALA
3486-166446-0036 AND AS MOTIONLESS RUTH MARTIN I CRIED ONCE MORE A DREADFUL DOUBT UPON ME MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHENCE DID THEY COME HIS VOICE WAS CLEAR AND CALM THE EYES BENEATH
3486-166446-0037 THESE CREATURES THAT WHEN MANY STILL ARE ONE THAT WHEN ONE STILL ARE MANY WHENCE DID THEY COME WHAT ARE THEY HE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE CUBES THAT HELD US THEIR HOSTS OF TINY EYES SHONE UP AT HIM ENIGMATICALLY
3486-166446-0038 AS THOUGH THEY HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD I DO NOT FORGET HE SAID AT LEAST NOT ALL DO I FORGET OF WHAT I SAW DURING THAT TIME WHEN I SEEMED AN ATOM OUTSIDE SPACE
3486-166446-0039 AS I TOLD YOU OR THINK I TOLD YOU SPEAKING WITH UNTHINKABLE EFFORT THROUGH LIPS THAT SEEMED ETERNITIES AWAY FROM ME THE ATOM WHO STROVE TO OPEN THEM
3486-166446-0040 REVELATIONS I KNOW NOT WHAT TO CALL THEM AND THOUGH EACH SEEMED EQUALLY REAL OF TWO OF THEM ONLY ONE I THINK CAN BE TRUE AND OF THE THIRD THAT MAY SOME TIME BE TRUE BUT SURELY IS NOT YET THROUGH THE AIR CAME A LOUDER DRUM ROLL
3486-166446-0041 IN IT SOMETHING OMINOUS SOMETHING SINISTER IT SWELLED TO A CRESCENDO ABRUPTLY CEASED AND NOW I SAW NORHALA RAISE HER HEAD LISTEN I SAW A WORLD A VAST WORLD GOODWIN MARCHING STATELY THROUGH SPACE
3486-166446-0042 IT WAS NO GLOBE IT WAS A WORLD OF MANY FACETS OF SMOOTH AND POLISHED PLANES
3486-166446-0043 A GEOMETRIC THOUGHT OF THE GREAT CAUSE OF GOD IF YOU WILL MADE MATERIAL IT WAS AIRLESS WATERLESS SUNLESS
3830-12529-0000 A BEAUTIFUL PEBBLY BEACH EXTENDED ALMOST TO THE WATER'S EDGE EVEN AT LOW TIDE THERE WAS A GRASSY LEVEL SPIT A BACKGROUND OF EVERGREEN GIANT FIR TIMBER
3830-12529-0001 AND SUCH FUEL FOR THE CAMP FIRE BROKEN LIMBS WITH JUST ENOUGH PITCH TO MAKE A CHEERFUL BLAZE AND YET BODY ENOUGH TO LAST WELL
3830-12529-0002 GLAD THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED OLIVER WAS THE CARPENTER OF THE PARTY THE TENT BUILDER WOOD GETTER AND GENERAL ROUSTABOUT WHILE I THE JUNIOR WAS CHIEF COOK AND BOTTLE WASHER
3830-12529-0003 AN ENCAMPMENT OF INDIANS BEING NEAR A PARTY OF THEM SOON VISITED OUR CAMP AND BEGAN MAKING SIGNS FOR TRADE
3830-12529-0004 SAID ONE OF THE MATRONS OF THE PARTY WHAT DOES SHE SAY OLIVER I'M BLESSED IF I KNOW BUT IT LOOKS AS IF SHE WANTED TO SELL SOME CLAMS AFTER CONSIDERABLE DICKERING WITH SIGNS AND GESTURES AND WORDS MANY TIMES REPEATED
3830-12529-0005 WE WERE ABLE TO IMPART THE INFORMATION THAT WE WANTED
3830-12530-0000 SOON WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A FLEET OF SEVEN VESSELS LYING AT ANCHOR IN A LARGE BAY SEVERAL MILES IN EXTENT THE SIGHT OF THOSE SEVEN VESSELS LYING IN THE OFFING MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION UPON OUR MINDS
3830-12530-0001 WE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SO MANY SHIPS AT ONE PLACE CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AMONG THEM WAS THE GOOD BARK MARY MELVILLE WITH HER GRUFF MATE AND BIG HEARTED MASTER CAPTAIN BARSTON
3830-12530-0002 UPON THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE SHORES OF THIS BAY LAY THE TWO TOWNS PORT STEILACOOM AND STEILACOOM CITY BOTH ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE A FAR LARGER TRADE CENTERED HERE THAN AT ANY OTHER POINT ON PUGET SOUND
3830-12530-0003 AND WE DECIDED ON A HALT TO MAKE OURSELVES ACQUAINTED WITH THE SURROUNDINGS A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE SHORE WE FOUND ALSO FORT STEILACOOM IT WAS SIMPLY THE CAMP OF A COMPANY OF UNITED STATES SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN WOODEN SHELLS OF HOUSES
3830-12530-0004 AND LOG CABINS INTENSE RIVALRY RAN BETWEEN THE TWO TOWNS UPPER AND LOWER STEILACOOM AT THIS TIME AS A RESULT THINGS WERE BOOMING
3830-12530-0005 WE WERE SORELY TEMPTED TO ACCEPT THE FLATTERING OFFER OF FOUR DOLLARS A DAY FOR COMMON LABOR IN A TIMBER CAMP BUT CONCLUDED NOT TO BE SWERVED FROM THE SEARCH FOR A NEW HOMESITE DURING THIS VISIT WE BEGAN SEEING INDIANS IN CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS
3830-12530-0006 THEY SEEMED TO BE A LISTLESS LOT WITH NO THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE OR EVEN FOR THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT THE INDIANS IN THOSE DAYS SEEMED TO WORK OR PLAY BY SPURTS AND SPELLS HERE AND THERE WE SAW A FAMILY
3830-12530-0007 BUT AS A CLASS THEY SEEMED TO ME THE LAZIEST SET OF PEOPLE ON EARTH THAT OPINION WAS MATERIALLY MODIFIED LATER AS I BECAME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR HABITS I HAVE FOUND JUST AS INDUSTRIOUS PEOPLE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
3830-12530-0008 AMONG THE INDIANS AS AMONG THE WHITES THE WORKERS IT MAY BE SAID ARE LESS NUMEROUS AMONG THE MEN THE WOMEN ARE ALL INDUSTRIOUS SHOULD WE CAMP HERE AND SPY OUT THE LAND OR SHOULD WE GO FORWARD AND SEE WHAT LAY BEFORE US
3830-12530-0009 AFTER A SOBER SECOND THOUGHT WE REALIZED THAT WE HAD NOTHING TO TRADE BUT LABOR AND WE HAD NOT COME AS FAR AS THIS TO BE LABORERS FOR HIRE WE HAD COME TO FIND A PLACE TO MAKE A FARM
3830-12530-0010 AND A FARM WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AGAIN WE SET ABOUT SEARCHING FOR CLAIMS AND THE MORE WE SEARCHED THE LESS WE LIKED THE LOOK OF THINGS FINALLY ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER A LONG WEARISOME TRAMP WE CAST OFF AT HIGH TIDE
3830-12530-0011 AND IN A DEAD CALM TO CONTINUE OUR CRUISE OLIVER SOON DROPPED INTO A COMFORTABLE AFTERNOON NAP LEAVING ME IN FULL COMMAND AS THE SUN SHONE WARM AND THE TIDE WAS TAKING US RAPIDLY IN THE DIRECTION WE WANTED TO GO
3830-12530-0012 WHY SHOULDN'T I DOZE A LITTLE TOO EVEN IF WE DID MISS SOME OF THE SIGHTSEEING I WAS AROUSED FROM MY NAP BY OLIVER'S EXCLAIMING WHAT IS THAT THEN HALF TO HIMSELF AS I LIVE IT'S A DEER SWIMMING OUT HERE IN THE BAY
3830-12530-0013 IT SURELY CAN'T BE I RESPONDED THREE QUARTERS ASLEEP THAT'S WHAT IT IS HE ASSERTED WE WERE WIDE AWAKE NOW AND GAVE CHASE VERY SOON WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE ANIMAL AND SUCCEEDED IN THROWING A ROPE OVER ITS HORNS
3830-12530-0014 BY THIS TIME WE HAD DRIFTED INTO THE NARROWS AND WE SOON FOUND WE HAD SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO DO THAN TO TOW A DEER
3830-12530-0015 A PERPENDICULAR BLUFF ROSE FROM THE HIGHWATER MARK LEAVING NO PLACE FOR CAMP FIRE OR BED
3830-12530-0016 AND WITH CONTENDING FORCES OF CURRENTS AND COUNTER CURRENTS YET ALL MOVING IN A GENERAL DIRECTION IT WAS OUR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO A GENUINE TIDE RIP THE WATERS BOILED AS IF IN A VERITABLE CALDRON SWELLING UP HERE AND THERE
3830-12530-0017 GIVE ME THE SALMON CAUGHT BY TROLLING IN EARLY SUMMER IN THE DEEP WATERS OF PUGET SOUND THE FISH SO FAT THAT THE EXCESS OF OIL MUST BE TURNED OUT OF THE PAN WHILE COOKING
3830-12530-0018 THE FOLLOWING DAY WE COULD SEE MT RAINIER WITH ITS REFLECTION IN THE PLACID WATERS OF THE BAY THEODORE WINTHROP THE OBSERVANT TRAVELER WHO CAME INTO THESE SAME WATERS A FEW MONTHS LATER AND WROTE OF IT AS MT TACOMA
3830-12530-0019 DESCRIBED IT AS A GIANT MOUNTAIN DOME OF SNOW SEEMING TO FILL THE AERIAL SPACES AS THE IMAGE DISPLACED THE BLUE DEEPS OF TRANQUIL WATER A WONDROUS SIGHT IT WAS AND IS WHATEVER THE NAME NEXT DAY WE ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE PUYALLUP
3830-12530-0020 AND THAT THE CURRENT WAS VERY STRONG WE SECURED THE SERVICES OF AN INDIAN AND HIS CANOE TO HELP US UP THE RIVER AND LEFT OUR BOAT AT THE INDIANS CAMP NEAR THE MOUTH IT TOOK A TUGGING OF TWO DAYS TO GO SIX MILES
3830-12530-0021 AND DRAG OUR CANOE AROUND THE DRIFTS IT WAS A STORY OF CONSTANT TOIL WITH CONSEQUENT DISCOURAGEMENT NOT ENDING UNTIL WE CAMPED
3830-12530-0022 AN INDIAN TRAIL LED UP THE RIVER FROM
3830-12530-0023 BUT WAGON ROADS THERE WERE NONE AND WHETHER A FEASIBLE ROUTE FOR ONE COULD BE FOUND ONLY TIME AND LABOR COULD DETERMINE WE RETRACED OUR STEPS AND IN THE EVENING LANDED AGAIN AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER AFTER A SEVERE DAY'S TOIL WE WERE IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD
3830-12530-0024 OLIVER DID NOT SING AS USUAL WHILE PREPARING FOR CAMP NEITHER DID I HAVE MUCH TO SAY BUT I FELL TO WORK MECHANICALLY PREPARING THE MUCH NEEDED MEAL WE ATE IN SILENCE AND THEN WENT TO SLEEP
3830-12530-0025 OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES OF UNOCCUPIED PRAIRIE LAND AS RICH AS ANYTHING THAT EVER LAY OUT OF DOORS ON OUR WAY FROM INDIANA TO OREGON IN SEARCH OF LAND ON WHICH TO MAKE A HOME HERE AT WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE END OF OUR ROPE
3830-12530-0026 WE HAD FOUND THE LAND BUT WITH CONDITIONS THAT SEEMED ALMOST TOO ADVERSE TO OVERCOME IT WAS A DISCOURAGING OUTLOOK EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN ROADS SUCH TIMBER IT SEEMED AN APPALLING UNDERTAKING TO CLEAR THIS LAND
3830-12530-0027 WHEN WE FELL ASLEEP THAT NIGHT IT WAS WITHOUT VISIONS OF NEW FOUND WEALTH AND YET LATER I DID TACKLE A QUARTER SECTION OF THAT HEAVIEST TIMBER LAND AND NEVER LET UP UNTIL THE LAST TREE LOG STUMP AND ROOT HAD DISAPPEARED
3830-12530-0028 THOUGH OF COURSE NOT ALL CLEARED OFF BY MY OWN HANDS IF WE COULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS COMING FOUR MONTHS LATER WE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN SPITE OF OUR DISCOURAGEMENT
3830-12530-0029 PASS TRAIL INTO WASHINGTON THEY LOCATED IN A BODY OVER NEARLY THE WHOLE VALLEY AND BEFORE THE YEAR WAS ENDED HAD MADE A ROUGH WAGON ROAD OUT TO THE PRAIRIES
3830-12530-0030 LEST SOME SMART FELLOW SHOULD UP AND SAY I WAS DRAWING ON MY IMAGINATION I AM NOT WHEN WE HAD BROKEN CAMP AND WERE SAILING ALONG WE HEARD A DULL SOUND LIKE THAT OFTEN HEARD
3830-12530-0031 IT EXTENDED AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE IN THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING THE SOUND INCREASED AND BECAME LIKE THE ROAR OF A HEAVY FALL OF RAIN OR HAIL ON WATER AND WE BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS A VAST SCHOOL OF FISH MOVING SOUTH
3830-12530-0032 WHILE MILLIONS WERE SEEMINGLY DANCING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER OR LEAPING IN THE AIR WE COULD FEEL THE FISH STRIKING AGAINST THE BOAT IN SUCH VAST NUMBERS THAT THEY FAIRLY MOVED IT THE LEAP IN THE AIR WAS SO HIGH
3830-12530-0033 ONE WOULD DROP INTO THE BOAT WE SOON DISCOVERED SOME INDIANS FOLLOWING THE SCHOOL
3830-12530-0034 WITH AN IMPROVISED NET WE TOO SOON OBTAINED ALL WE WANTED WHEN WE BEGAN TO GO ON WE WERE EMBARRASSED BY THE MASS OF FISH MOVING IN THE WATER AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO END TO THE SCHOOL AHEAD OF US BUT WE FINALLY GOT CLEAR OF THE MOVING MASS
3830-12530-0035 AND REACHED THE ISLAND SHORE IN SAFETY ONLY TO BECOME WEATHER BOUND IN THE WILDS ONCE MORE THIS CAMP DID NOT PROVE SO DREARY AS THE LAST ONE ALTHOUGH IT WAS MORE EXPOSED TO THE SWELL OF THE BIG WATERS
3830-12530-0036 AND THE SWEEP OF THE WIND TO THE NORTH WE HAD A VIEW OF THIRTY MILES OR MORE TO WHERE HORIZON AND WATER BLENDED LEAVING IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER LAND WAS IN SIGHT OR NOT AS WE AFTERWARDS ASCERTAINED WE COULD SEE THE FAMOUS SAN JUAN ISLAND
3830-12530-0037 LATER THE BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AND GREAT BRITAIN WHEN THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS SETTLED PORT TOWNSEND LAY
3830-12530-0038 THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE TOWN LIKE THE LOST HUNTERS WE KNEW WHERE WE WERE BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ANY PLACE ELSE WAS NOT LOST OURSELVES THE WORLD WAS LOST FROM US THREE SHIPS PASSED US WHILE WE WERE AT THIS CAMP
3830-12530-0039 A MERE SPECK AND GROWING TO A FULL FLEDGED DEEP SEA VESSEL WITH ALL SAILS SET SCUDDING BEFORE THE WIND THE OTHER TWO WERE GRACEFULLY BEATING THEIR WAY OUT
3830-12530-0040 WITH THE BEAUTIFUL OPEN AND COMPARATIVELY LEVEL PLATEAU IN THE BACKGROUND AND TWO OR THREE VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN THE FOREGROUND MADE A PICTURE OF A PERFECT CITY SITE
3830-12530-0041 MANY SHACKS AND CAMPS AT FIRST MISTAKEN FOR THE WHITE MEN'S HOUSES WERE FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY NATIVES THEY WERE A DRUNKEN RASCALLY RABBLE SPENDING THEIR GAINS FROM THE SALE OF FISH AND OIL
3830-12530-0042 IN A DEBAUCH THAT WOULD LAST AS LONG AS THEIR MONEY HELD OUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A MORE STALWART RACE OF INDIANS THAN THOSE TO THE SOUTH DOUBTLESS FROM THE BUFFETING RECEIVED IN THE LARGER WATERS THEY WOULD OFTEN GO OUT EVEN TO THE OPEN SEA
3830-12530-0043 ON THEIR FISHING EXCURSIONS IN CANOES MANNED BY THIRTY MEN OR MORE AFTER SPENDING TWO OR THREE DAYS EXPLORING THE COUNTRY WE TURNED BACK TO THE BAY WHERE LAY THE SEVEN SHIPS WE HAD SEEN NEAR STEILACOOM WE REMEMBERED THE TIMBER CAMPS
3830-12530-0044 THE BUSTLE AND STIR OF THE LITTLE NEW VILLAGE AND THE ACTIVITY THAT WE SAW THERE GREATER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE WATERS OF THE SOUND MOST OF ALL MY THOUGHTS WOULD GO ON TO THE LITTLE CABIN ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER THREE DAYS SUFFICED TO LAND
3830-12530-0045 US BACK IN THE BAY WE SOUGHT BUT THE SHIPS WERE GONE NOT A SAILING CRAFT OF ANY KIND WAS IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE TOWN
3830-12531-0000 CAN I GET HOME TONIGHT I ASKED MYSELF IT WAS AN AFTERNOON OF THE LAST WEEK OF JUNE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND THE SUN WAS YET HIGH I WAS WELL UP THE LEFT BANK OF THE COWLITZ RIVER HOW FAR I COULD NOT TELL
3830-12531-0001 FOR THERE WERE NO MILESTONES ON THE CROOKED HALF OBSTRUCTED TRAIL LEADING DOWNSTREAM AT BEST IT WOULD BE A RACE WITH THE SUN BUT THE DAYS WERE LONG AND THE TWILIGHT WAS LONG
3830-12531-0002 I WORE A HEAVY WOOLEN SHIRT A SLOUCH HAT AND WORN SHOES BOTH HAT AND SHOES GAVE AMPLE VENTILATION SOCKS I HAD NONE NEITHER HAD I SUSPENDERS AN IMPROVISED BELT
3830-12531-0003 TAKING THEIR PLACE I WAS DRESSED FOR THE RACE AND WAS EAGER FOR THE TRIAL AT OLYMPIA I HAD PARTED WITH MY BROTHER
3830-12531-0004 WHILE I WAS TO GO HOME FOR THE WIFE AND BABY TO REMOVE THEM TO OUR NEW HOME I DID NOT PARTICULARLY MIND THE CAMPING BUT I DID NOT FANCY THE IDEA OF LYING OUT SO NEAR HOME IF BY EXTRA EXERTION I COULD REACH THE CABIN BEFORE NIGHT
3830-12531-0005 WE NEVER THOUGHT OF CATCHING COLD FROM LYING ON THE GROUND OR ON CEDAR BOUGHS OR FROM GETTING A GOOD DRENCHING AFTER ALL THE CABIN COULD NOT BE REACHED AS THE TRAIL COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED AT NIGHT
3830-12531-0006 SLACKENING PACE AT NIGHTFALL TO COOL MY SYSTEM GRADUALLY I FINALLY MADE MY CAMP AND SLEPT AS SOUNDLY AS IF ON A BED OF DOWN MY CONSOLATION WAS THAT THE NIGHT WAS SHORT AND I COULD SEE TO TRAVEL BY THREE O'CLOCK
3830-12531-0007 I DO NOT LOOK UPON THOSE YEARS OF CAMP AND CABIN LIFE AS YEARS OF HARDSHIP TO BE SURE OUR FOOD WAS PLAIN AS WELL AS OUR DRESS OUR HOURS OF LABOR WERE LONG AND THE LABOR ITSELF WAS FREQUENTLY SEVERE THE PIONEERS APPEARED ROUGH AND UNCOUTH
3830-12531-0008 WE NEVER WATCHED FOR THE SUN TO GO DOWN
3830-12531-0009 OR FOR THE BOSS TO QUICKEN OUR STEPS THE DAYS WERE ALWAYS TOO SHORT AND INTEREST IN OUR WORK WAS ALWAYS UNABATED THE CABIN COULD NOT BE SEEN UNTIL THE TRAIL CAME QUITE NEAR IT WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CURL OF SMOKE I KNEW I WAS ALMOST THERE THEN I SAW THE CABIN
3830-12531-0010 AND A LITTLE LADY IN ALMOST BLOOMER DRESS MILKING THE COW SHE NEVER FINISHED MILKING THAT COW NOR DID SHE EVER MILK ANY COW WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS AT HOME THERE WERE SO MANY THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT WE COULD SCARCELY TELL WHERE TO BEGIN OR WHEN TO STOP
3830-12531-0011 MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY CENTERED ON THE QUESTION OF OUR MOVING TO A NEW HOME WHY AT OLYMPIA EGGS WERE A DOLLAR A DOZEN I SAW THEM SELLING AT THAT THE BUTTER YOU HAVE THERE WOULD BRING YOU A DOLLAR A POUND AS FAST AS YOU COULD WEIGH IT OUT
3830-12531-0012 I SAW STUFF THEY CALLED BUTTER SELL FOR THAT POTATOES ARE SELLING FOR THREE DOLLARS A BUSHEL AND ONIONS AT FOUR EVERYTHING THE FARMER RAISES SELLS HIGH WHO BUYS OH ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS TO BUY
3830-12531-0013 WHERE DO THEY GET THE MONEY EVERYBODY SEEMS TO HAVE MONEY SOME TAKE IT THERE WITH THEM MEN WORKING IN THE TIMBER CAMPS GET FOUR DOLLARS A DAY AND THEIR BOARD AT ONE PLACE THEY PAID FOUR DOLLARS A CORD FOR WOOD TO SHIP TO SAN FRANCISCO
3830-12531-0014 AND A MAN CAN SELL ALL THE SHINGLES HE CAN MAKE AT FOUR DOLLARS A THOUSAND I WAS OFFERED FIVE CENTS A FOOT FOR PILES IF WE HAD BUCK AND DANDY OVER THERE WE COULD MAKE TWENTY DOLLARS A DAY
3830-12531-0015 OFF THE GOVERNMENT LAND OF COURSE ALL HELP THEMSELVES TO WHAT THEY WANT THEN THERE ARE THE FISH AND THE CLAMS AND OYSTERS AND BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LAND FOR THE CLAIM THAT QUESTION WAS A STUMPER THE LITTLE WIFE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT BARGAIN MADE BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED
3830-12531-0016 NOW I FOUND MYSELF PRAISING A COUNTRY FOR THE AGRICULTURAL QUALITIES OF WHICH I COULD NOT SAY MUCH BUT IF WE COULD SELL PRODUCE HIGHER MIGHT WE NOT WELL LOWER OUR STANDARD OF AN IDEAL FARM THE CLAIM I HAD TAKEN WAS DESCRIBED WITH A TOUCH OF APOLOGY
3830-12531-0017 HOWEVER WE DECIDED TO MOVE AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR THE JOURNEY THE WIFE BABY BEDDING OX YOKE AND LOG CHAIN WERE SENT UP THE COWLITZ IN A CANOE BUCK AND DANDY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0018 ON THIS OCCASION I WAS ILL PREPARED FOR A COOL NIGHT CAMP HAVING NEITHER BLANKET NOR COAT I HAD EXPECTED TO REACH HARD BREAD'S HOTEL WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE CANOE WOULD STOP OVERNIGHT BUT I COULD NOT MAKE IT SO AGAIN I LAY OUT ON THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0019 HARD BREAD'S AN ODD NAME FOR A HOTEL WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE THE OLD WIDOWER THAT KEPT THE PLACE FED HIS PATRONS ON HARDTACK THREE TIMES A DAY I FOUND THAT MY WIFE HAD NOT FARED ANY BETTER THAN I HAD ON THE TRAIL AND IN FACT
3830-12531-0020 NOT SO WELL THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN THAT IS THE HOTEL WAS A GREAT DEAL HARDER THAN THE SAND SPIT WHERE I HAD PASSED THE NIGHT I HAD PLENTY OF PURE FRESH AIR WHILE SHE IN A CLOSED CABIN
3830-12531-0021 AND IN THE SAME ROOM WITH MANY OTHERS HAD NEITHER FRESH AIR NOR FREEDOM FROM CREEPING THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE MISERABLE WITH HER SHOES FOR A PILLOW A SHAWL FOR COVERING SMALL WONDER THAT SHE REPORTED I DID NOT SLEEP A WINK LAST NIGHT
3830-12531-0022 WE SOON ARRIVED AT THE COWLITZ LANDING THE END OF THE CANOE JOURNEY STRIKING THE TENT THAT HAD SERVED US SO WELL ON THE PLAINS AND MAKING A CHEERFUL CAMP FIRE WE SPEEDILY FORGOT THE HARD EXPERIENCES OF THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0023 FIFTY MILES MORE OF TRAVEL LAY BEFORE US AND SUCH A ROAD HOWEVER WE HAD ONE CONSOLATION IT WOULD BE WORSE IN WINTER THAN AT THAT TIME
3830-12531-0024 OUR COWS WERE GONE GIVEN FOR PROVENDER TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE OXEN DURING THE DEEP DECEMBER SNOW SO WHEN WE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK WE HAD THE BABY BUCK AND DANDY A TENT AN OX YOKE AND CHAIN ENOUGH CLOTHING AND BEDDING TO KEEP US COMFORTABLE
3830-12531-0025 A VERY LITTLE FOOD AND NO MONEY THE MONEY HAD ALL BEEN EXPENDED ON THE CANOE PASSAGE SHOULD WE PACK THE OXEN AND WALK
3830-12531-0026 THIS LAST PROPOSITION WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE AND SO NEXT MORNING DRIVING MY OXEN BEFORE ME AND LEAVING WIFE AND BABY TO TAKE CARE OF THE CAMP
3830-12531-0027 STRANGER THOUGH I WAS TO SAY YES YOU CAN HAVE TWO IF YOU NEED THEM JACKSON HAD SETTLED THERE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE
3830-12531-0028 THE DREAD DISEASE HAD TERRORS THEN THAT IT DOES NOT NOW POSSESS COULD IT BE POSSIBLE MY FOLKS HAD BEEN TAKEN SICK
3830-12531-0029 IT APPEARED THAT I HAD SCARCELY GOT OUT OF SIGHT ON MY TRIP BACK WITH THE OXEN BEFORE ONE OF THOSE ROYAL PIONEER MATRONS HAD COME TO THE CAMP SHE PLEADED AND INSISTED AND FINALLY ALMOST FRIGHTENED THE LITTLE WIFE INTO GOING WITH HER
3830-12531-0030 AND SHARING HER HOUSE WHICH WAS NEAR BY
3830-12531-0031 FINDING THAT THE BOAT AND PROVISIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN AND SEEING SMOKE IN THE BIGHT
3830-12535-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FINDING MY PEOPLE ON LEAVING MY NEWLY FOUND FRIENDS I FACED A DISCOURAGING PROSPECT THE START FOR THE HIGH ARID TABLE LANDS BORDERING THE YAKIMA VALLEY CUT ME LOOSE FROM ALL COMMUNICATION
3830-12535-0001 NO MORE IMMIGRANTS WERE MET UNTIL I REACHED THE MAIN TRAVELED ROUTE BEYOND THE COLUMBIA RIVER THE ROAD LAY THROUGH A FORBIDDING SAGE PLAIN OR RATHER AN UNDULATING COUNTRY COVERED BY SHIFTING SANDS
3830-12535-0002 AS THE SUN ROSE THE HEAT BECAME INTOLERABLE THE DUST IN PLACES BROUGHT VIVID MEMORIES OF THE TRIP ACROSS THE PLAINS
3830-12535-0003 TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE EXPECTED TRAIN
3830-12535-0004 AND COMPELLED ME TO LEAVE THE ROAD AND DESCEND INTO THE VALLEY FOR WATER
3830-12535-0005 THAT LASTED UNTIL DURING THE AFTERNOON WHEN I FOUND WATER ON THE TRAIL TETHERING MY PONY FOR HIS MUCH NEEDED DINNER I OPENED MY SACK OF HARD BREAD TO COUNT THE CONTENTS MY STORE WAS HALF GONE I LAY DOWN IN THE SHADE OF A SMALL TREE
3830-12535-0006 NEAR THE SPRING TO TAKE AN AFTERNOON NAP ROUSING BEFORE SUNDOWN REFRESHED BOBBY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL WITH NEW COURAGE WHEN NIGHT CAME I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO CAMP THE COOL OF THE EVENING INVIGORATED THE PONY AND WE PUSHED ON
3830-12535-0007 FINDING THAT THE ROAD COULD BE FOLLOWED THOUGH BUT DIMLY SEEN I KEPT ON THE TRAIL UNTIL A LATE HOUR WHEN I UNSADDLED AND HOBBLED THE PONY THE SADDLE BLANKET WAS BROUGHT INTO USE AND I WAS SOON OFF IN DREAMLAND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE DUST THE TRAIL OR THE MORROW
3830-12535-0008 TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE HIS HOBBLES HAD BECOME LOOSENED GIVING HIM FREE USE OF ALL HIS FEET AND HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO TAKE THE TRAIL AGAIN COAXING WAS OF NO AVAIL DRIVING WOULD DO NO GOOD
3830-12535-0009 I FOLLOWED HIM AROUND ABOUT OVER THE PLAIN AND THROUGH THE SAGE BRUSH AT A RAPID GAIT FINALLY HE SLACKENED PACE AND I AGAIN BECAME MASTER
3830-12535-0010 ALL THIS ROAMING OVER THE PLAIN AT BOBBY'S HEELS BUT I HAPPENED TO TAKE THE RIGHT COURSE WHEN THE TRAIL WAS FOUND THERE WAS THE SADDLE TO LOOK FOR AND THIS WAS LOCATED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
3830-12535-0011 A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF TRAVEL BROUGHT UNEASINESS AS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE NOT ON THE REGULAR TRAIL NOT KNOWING BUT THIS WAS SOME CUT OFF I WENT ON UNTIL THE COLUMBIA RIVER BLUFF WAS REACHED AND THE GREAT RIVER WAS IN SIGHT
3830-12535-0012 HALF A MILE DISTANT AND SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET LOWER TAKING A TRAIL DOWN THE BLUFF THAT SEEMED MORE PROMISING THAN THE WAGON TRACKS I BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR THE ROAD AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF
3830-12535-0013 ONLY TO FIND EVERY SEMBLANCE OF A ROAD GONE I LOST MORE THAN A HALF DAY'S PRECIOUS TIME AND AGAIN WAS THROWN INTO ANXIETY LEST I HAD MISSED THE LONG SOUGHT TRAIN THE NEXT INCIDENT THAT I REMEMBER VIVIDLY WAS MY ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE COLUMBIA
3830-12535-0014 JUST BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE SNAKE RIVER I HAD SEEN BUT FEW INDIANS ON THE WHOLE TRIP AND IN FACT THE CAMP I FOUND THERE ON THE BANK OF THE GREAT RIVER WAS THE FIRST I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER COMING UPON I COULD NOT INDUCE THE INDIANS TO CROSS ME OVER
3830-12535-0015 THEY SEEMED SURLY AND UNFRIENDLY THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS SO IN CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE INDIANS ON THE SOUND THAT I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT IT MEANT NO ONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE LOST HIS LIFE AT THE HANDS OF THE INDIANS THAT SEASON
3830-12535-0016 UNTIL I WAS HOARSE FROM THE VIOLENT EFFORT FINALLY WHILE SITTING THERE WONDERING WHAT TO DO I SPIED A BLUE SMOKE ARISING FROM A CABIN ON THE OTHER SIDE SOON AFTER I SAW A MAN HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO MY RENEWED EFFORTS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
3830-12535-0017 THE TROUBLE HAD BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ALL ASLEEP WHILE I WAS THERE IN THE EARLY MORNING EXPENDING MY BREATH FOR NOTHING THE MAN WAS SHIRLEY ENSIGN OF OLYMPIA WHO HAD ESTABLISHED A FERRY ACROSS THE COLUMBIA RIVER AND HAD LINGERED TO SET OVER BELATED IMMIGRANTS IF ANY SHOULD COME ALONG
3830-12535-0018 AND HAD MET MY PEOPLE THEY WERE CAMPED SOME THIRTY MILES AWAY HE THOUGHT
3830-12535-0019 BUT I COULD NOT WAIT THERE FOR THEM
3830-12535-0020 DETERMINED TO REACH CAMP THAT NIGHT IF I COULD POSSIBLY DO SO
3830-12535-0021 DUSK CAME ON AND STILL NO SIGNS THEN I SPIED SOME CATTLE GRAZING ON THE UPLAND AND SOON CAME UPON THE CAMP IN A RAVINE THAT HAD SHUT IT FROM VIEW REJOICING AND OUTBURSTS OF GRIEF FOLLOWED I INQUIRED FOR MY MOTHER THE FIRST THING
3830-12535-0022 SHE WAS NOT THERE MONTHS BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE SANDS OF THE PLATTE VALLEY MY YOUNGER BROTHER ALSO LAY BURIED ON THE PLAINS NEAR INDEPENDENCE ROCK
3830-12535-0023 WHEN WE CAME TO CONSIDER HOW THE PARTY SHOULD PROCEED I ADVISED THE OVER MOUNTAIN TRIP BUT I CAUTIONED THEM TO EXPECT SOME SNOW AND MUCH HARD WORK HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE THEY ASKED ABOUT THREE WEEKS THIS BROUGHT DISAPPOINTMENT
3830-12535-0024 THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THROUGH WITH THE JOURNEY YOU CAME TO STAY WITH US DIDN'T YOU I WANT TO BUT WHAT ABOUT MY WIFE AND THE TWO BABIES AT THE ISLAND FATHER SAID SOME ONE MUST GO AND LOOK AFTER THEM SO OLIVER WAS SENT AHEAD
3830-12535-0025 WHILE I WAS TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND HELP THE IMMIGRANTS THROUGH THE NATCHESS PASS IN OUR TRAIN WERE FIFTY OR MORE HEAD OF STOCK SEVEN WAGONS AND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE WE MADE THE TRIP ACROSS THE DIVIDE IN TWENTY TWO DAYS WITHOUT SERIOUS MISHAP OR LOSS
3830-12535-0026 THAT BESET OUR WAY AT EVERY STEP EVERY MAN LITERALLY PUT HIS SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL WE WERE COMPELLED OFTEN TO TAKE HOLD OF THE WHEELS TO BOOST THE WAGONS OVER THE LOGS OR TO EASE THEM DOWN STEEP PLACES
3830-12535-0027 ONE MAN TO EACH WAGON TO DRIVE FOUR TO ACT AS WHEELMEN FATHER AND THE WOMEN ON FOOT OR HORSEBACK TO DRIVE THE STOCK GOD BLESS THE WOMEN FOLKS OF THE PLAINS NOBLER BRAVER MORE UNCOMPLAINING SOULS WERE NEVER KNOWN
3830-12535-0028 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME ONE OUGHT TO WRITE A JUST TRIBUTE TO THEIR VALOR AND PATIENCE A BOOK OF THEIR HEROIC DEEDS ONE DAY WE ENCOUNTERED A NEWLY FALLEN TREE COCKED UP ON ITS OWN UPTURNED ROOTS FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND GO AROUND IT WE COULD NOT
3830-12535-0029 TO CUT IT OUT WITH OUR DULLED FLIMSY SAW SEEMED AN ENDLESS TASK DIG DOWN BOYS SAID FATHER AND IN SHORT ORDER EVERY AVAILABLE SHOVEL WAS OUT OF THE WAGONS VERY SOON THE WAY WAS OPEN FULLY FOUR FEET DEEP AND OXEN AND WAGONS PASSED UNDER THE OBSTRUCTION
3830-12535-0030 DO YOU SAY THAT WE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIPS THAT DEPENDS UPON THE POINT OF VIEW AS TO THIS RETURN TRIP I CAN TRULY SAY FOR MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT ONE OF HARDSHIP I ENJOYED OVERCOMING THE DIFFICULTIES AND SO DID THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE COMPANY
3830-12535-0031 BUT BETTER FOOD WAS OBTAINABLE AND THE GOAL WAS NEAR AT HAND IT WAS A POSITIVE PLEASURE THEREFORE TO PASS OVER THE MILES ONE BY ONE
3830-12535-0032 WHEN OUR LITTLE TRAIN AT LAST EMERGED FROM THE FORESTS AND CAME OUT INTO THE NISQUALLY PLAINS
3830-12535-0033 SO MARKED WAS THE CONTRAST HUNDREDS OF CATTLE SHEEP AND HORSES WERE QUIETLY GRAZING SCATTERED OVER THE LANDSCAPE AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE
