3240-131231-0000 ATTEMPTS TO PRESERVE THE SYSTEM THAT SMALL FROGS AND TOADS FOR INSTANCE NEVER HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY BUT WERE ON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE OR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH FALLS UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
3240-131231-0001 WERE THERE SOME ESPECIALLY FROGGY PLACE NEAR EUROPE AS THERE IS AN ESPECIALLY SANDY PLACE THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION WOULD OF COURSE BE THAT ALL SMALL FROGS FALLING FROM THE SKY IN EUROPE COME FROM THAT CENTER OF FROGEITY TO START WITH
3240-131231-0002 I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT I AM PERMITTED TO SEE BECAUSE I AM STILL PRIMITIVE OR INTELLIGENT OR IN A STATE OF MALADJUSTMENT
3240-131231-0003 OF A FALL OF TADPOLES FROM THE SKY AS TO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0004 THE WRITER SAYS THAT ALL OBSERVERS WERE MISTAKEN THAT THE FROGS OR TOADS MUST HAVE FALLEN FROM TREES OR OTHER PLACES OVERHEAD TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF LITTLE TOADS ONE OR TWO MONTHS OLD
3240-131231-0005 THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM A GREAT THICK CLOUD THAT APPEARED SUDDENLY IN A SKY THAT HAD BEEN CLOUDLESS AUGUST EIGHTEEN O FOUR NEAR TOULOUSE FRANCE ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM PROFESSOR PONTUS TO M ARAGO
3240-131231-0006 MANY INSTANCES OF FROGS THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0007 AS TO HAVING BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0008 JULY THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0009 LITTLE TOADS FOUND IN A DESERT AFTER A RAINFALL NOTES AND QUERIES
3240-131231-0010 TO START WITH I DO NOT DENY POSITIVELY THE CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION OF UP AND DOWN I THINK THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SUCH OCCURRENCES I OMIT MANY NOTES THAT I HAVE UPON INDISTINGUISHABLES
3240-131231-0011 IN THE LONDON TIMES JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF A SHOWER OF TWIGS AND LEAVES AND TINY TOADS IN A STORM UPON THE SLOPES OF THE APENNINES THESE MAY HAVE BEEN THE EJECTAMENTA OF A WHIRLWIND I ADD HOWEVER
3240-131231-0012 THAT I HAVE NOTES UPON TWO OTHER FALLS OF TINY TOADS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE ONE IN FRANCE AND ONE IN TAHITI ALSO OF FISH IN SCOTLAND BUT IN THE PHENOMENON OF THE APENNINES THE MIXTURE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF THE PRODUCTS OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0013 THE OTHER INSTANCES SEEM TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF SOMETHING LIKE MIGRATION THEIR GREAT NUMBERS AND THEIR HOMOGENEITY OVER AND OVER IN THESE ANNALS OF THE DAMNED OCCURS THE DATUM OF SEGREGATION
3240-131231-0014 BUT A WHIRLWIND IS THOUGHT OF AS A CONDITION OF CHAOS QUASI CHAOS
3240-131231-0015 MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JULY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE A SMALL POND IN THE TRACK OF THE CLOUD WAS SUCKED DRY THE WATER BEING CARRIED OVER THE ADJOINING FIELDS TOGETHER WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF SOFT MUD WHICH WAS SCATTERED OVER THE GROUND FOR HALF A MILE AROUND
3240-131231-0016 BUT HERE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A SCOOP IN THE EXCLUSIONIST IMAGINATION THERE IS NO REGARD FOR MUD DEBRIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF A POND FLOATING VEGETATION LOOSE THINGS FROM THE SHORES BUT A PRECISE PICKING OUT OF FROGS ONLY
3240-131231-0017 OF ALL INSTANCES I HAVE THAT ATTRIBUTE THE FALL OF SMALL FROGS OR TOADS TO WHIRLWINDS ONLY ONE DEFINITELY IDENTIFIES OR PLACES THE WHIRLWIND ALSO AS HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE A POND GOING UP WOULD BE QUITE AS INTERESTING AS FROGS COMING DOWN
3240-131231-0018 WHIRLWINDS WE READ OF OVER AND OVER BUT WHERE AND WHAT WHIRLWIND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANYBODY WHO HAD LOST A POND WOULD BE HEARD FROM IN SYMONS METEOROLOGICAL MAGAZINE
3240-131231-0019 A FALL OF SMALL FROGS NEAR BIRMINGHAM ENGLAND JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO IS ATTRIBUTED TO A SPECIFIC WHIRLWIND BUT NOT A WORD AS TO ANY SPECIAL POND THAT HAD CONTRIBUTED
3240-131231-0020 AND SOMETHING THAT STRIKES MY ATTENTION HERE IS THAT THESE FROGS ARE DESCRIBED AS ALMOST WHITE I'M AFRAID THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR US WE SHALL HAVE TO GIVE TO CIVILIZATION UPON THIS EARTH SOME NEW WORLDS PLACES WITH WHITE FROGS IN THEM
3240-131231-0021 IN SPITE OF ALL WE THINK WE KNOW OF THE ACCELERATIVE VELOCITY OF FALLING BODIES AND HAVE PROPAGATED WHY THE EXOTIC BECOMES THE INDIGENOUS OR FROM THE STRANGEST OF PLACES WE'D EXPECT THE FAMILIAR OR
3240-131231-0022 IF HOSTS OF LIVING FROGS HAVE COME HERE FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE EVERY LIVING THING UPON THIS EARTH MAY ANCESTRALLY HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE I FIND THAT I HAVE ANOTHER NOTE UPON A SPECIFIC HURRICANE
3240-131231-0023 AFTER ONE OF THE GREATEST HURRICANES IN THE HISTORY OF IRELAND SOME FISH WERE FOUND AS FAR AS FIFTEEN YARDS FROM THE EDGE OF A LAKE HAVE ANOTHER THIS IS A GOOD ONE FOR THE EXCLUSIONISTS FALL OF FISH IN PARIS SAID THAT A NEIGHBORING POND HAD BEEN BLOWN DRY
3240-131231-0024 DATE NOT GIVEN BUT I HAVE SEEN IT RECORDED SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BEST KNOWN FALL OF FISHES FROM THE SKY IS THAT WHICH OCCURRED AT MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0025 FEBRUARY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE THE EDITOR OF THE ZOOLOGIST
3240-131231-0026 HAVING PUBLISHED A REPORT OF A FALL OF FISHES WRITES I AM CONTINUALLY RECEIVING SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF FROGS AND FISHES BUT IN ALL THE VOLUMES OF THE ZOOLOGIST I CAN FIND ONLY TWO REPORTS OF SUCH FALLS THERE IS NOTHING TO CONCLUDE
3240-131231-0027 OTHER THAN THAT HOSTS OF DATA HAVE BEEN LOST BECAUSE ORTHODOXY DOES NOT LOOK FAVORABLY UPON SUCH REPORTS THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW RECORDS SEVERAL FALLS OF FISHES IN THE UNITED STATES
3240-131231-0028 NEVERTHELESS THE TREATMENT BY THE ZOOLOGIST OF THE FALL REPORTED FROM MOUNTAIN ASH IS FAIR FIRST APPEARS
3240-131231-0029 VICAR OF ABEDARE ASSERTING THAT THE FALL HAD OCCURRED CHIEFLY UPON THE PROPERTY OF MISTER NIXON OF MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0030 OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BRISTLING WITH EXCLUSIONISM WRITES THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM ALIVE WERE VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HE SAYS ON READING THE EVIDENCE IT SEEMS TO ME MOST PROBABLY ONLY A PRACTICAL JOKE
3240-131231-0031 THE EDITOR SAYS THAT ONE WAS A MINNOW AND THAT THE REST WERE STICKLEBACKS HE SAYS THAT DOCTOR GRAY'S EXPLANATION IS NO DOUBT RIGHT BUT
3240-131231-0032 HE PUBLISHES A LETTER FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT WHO APOLOGIZES FOR OPPOSING SO HIGH AN AUTHORITY AS DOCTOR GRAY BUT SAYS THAT HE HAD OBTAINED SOME OF THESE FISHES FROM PERSONS WHO LIVED AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE APART
3240-131231-0033 OR CONSIDERABLY OUT OF RANGE OF THE PLAYFUL PAIL OF WATER ACCORDING TO THE ANNUAL REGISTER
3240-131231-0034 THE FISHES THEMSELVES HAD FALLEN BY PAILFULS IF THESE FISHES WERE NOT UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE WE BASE OUR OBJECTIONS TO THE WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION UPON TWO DATA THAT THEY FELL IN NO SUCH DISTRIBUTION AS ONE COULD ATTRIBUTE TO THE DISCHARGE OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0035 THAT TEN MINUTES LATER ANOTHER FALL OF FISHES OCCURRED UPON THIS SAME NARROW STRIP OF LAND EVEN ARGUING THAT A WHIRLWIND MAY STAND STILL AXIALLY IT DISCHARGES TANGENTIALLY WHEREVER THE FISHES CAME FROM IT DOES NOT SEEM THINKABLE
3240-131231-0036 THAT SOME COULD HAVE FALLEN AND THAT OTHERS COULD HAVE WHIRLED EVEN A TENTH OF A MINUTE THEN FALLING DIRECTLY AFTER THE FIRST TO FALL BECAUSE OF THESE EVIL CIRCUMSTANCES THE BEST ADAPTATION WAS TO LAUGH THE WHOLE THING OFF
3240-131231-0037 VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HAD BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH SECOND EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE IS A LETTER FROM MISTER AARON ROBERTS CURATE OF SAINT PETER'S CARMATHON IN THIS LETTER
3240-131231-0038 BUT THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF SPECIES I THINK MYSELF THAT THEY WERE MINNOWS AND STICKLEBACKS SOME PERSONS THINKING THEM TO BE SEA FISHES PLACED THEM IN SALT WATER ACCORDING TO MISTER ROBERTS
3240-131231-0039 SOME WERE PLACED IN FRESH WATER THESE SEEMED TO THRIVE WELL AS TO NARROW DISTRIBUTION WE ARE TOLD THAT THE FISHES FELL IN AND ABOUT THE PREMISES OF MISTER NIXON IT WAS NOT OBSERVED AT THE TIME THAT ANY FISH FELL IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
3240-131231-0040 SAVE IN THE PARTICULAR SPOT MENTIONED IN THE LONDON TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE VICAR GRIFFITH WRITES AN ACCOUNT THE ROOFS OF SOME HOUSES WERE COVERED WITH THEM
3240-131231-0041 IN THIS LETTER IT IS SAID THAT THE LARGEST FISHES WERE FIVE INCHES LONG AND THAT THESE DID NOT SURVIVE THE FALL REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION
3240-131231-0042 THE EVIDENCE OF THE FALL OF FISH ON THIS OCCASION WAS VERY CONCLUSIVE A SPECIMEN OF THE FISH WAS EXHIBITED
3240-131231-0043 LEIRUS GASTEROSTEUS IS THE STICKLEBACK ALTOGETHER I THINK WE HAVE NOT A SENSE OF TOTAL PERDITION
3240-131231-0044 IN WHICH WERE THOUSANDS OF FISHES FOUR OR FIVE INCHES LONG SOME OF WHICH COVERED ROOFS OF HOUSES AND SOME OF WHICH REMAINED TEN MINUTES IN THE AIR BY WAY OF CONTRAST WE OFFER OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE THAT THE BOTTOM OF A SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL POND HAD DROPPED OUT
3240-131231-0045 I HAVE A GREAT MANY NOTES UPON THE FALL OF FISHES DESPITE THE DIFFICULTY THESE RECORDS HAVE IN GETTING THEMSELVES PUBLISHED BUT I PICK OUT THE INSTANCES THAT ESPECIALLY RELATE TO OUR SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL ACCEPTANCES
3240-131231-0046 THAT HAVE FALLEN WITH A DISTRIBUTION NARROWER THAN IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A WHIRLWIND THAT HAVE FALLEN FOR A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME UPON THE SAME NARROW AREA OF LAND THESE THREE FACTORS INDICATE SOMEWHERE NOT FAR ALOFT
3240-131231-0047 A REGION OF INERTNESS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION OF COURSE HOWEVER A REGION THAT BY THE FLUX AND VARIATION OF ALL THINGS MUST AT TIMES BE SUSCEPTIBLE BUT AFTERWARD OUR HERESY WILL BIFURCATE
3240-131231-0048 IN AMIABLE ACCOMMODATION TO THE CRUCIFIXION IT'LL GET I THINK BUT SO IMPRESSED ARE WE WITH THE DATUM THAT THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF SMALL FROGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0049 THAT TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ANOTHER ADJUSTMENT MUST BE MADE APART FROM OUR THREE FACTORS OF INDICATION AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVATION IS THE FALL OF LIVING THINGS WITHOUT INJURY TO THEM
3240-131231-0050 SOMETHING ELSE APART FROM OUR THREE MAIN INTERESTS IS A PHENOMENON THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL AN ALTERNATING SERIES OF FALLS OF FISHES WHATEVER THE SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE
3240-131231-0051 JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0052 FIFESHIRE SCOTLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR
3240-131231-0053 MORADABAD INDIA JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0054 ROSS SHIRE SCOTLAND EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0055 MORADABAD INDIA JULY TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE
3240-131231-0056 FERIDPOOR INDIA FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY
3240-131231-0057 DISREGARDING SERIAL SIGNIFICANCE OR MECHANICAL UNINTELLIGENT REPULSIVE REFLEX IS THAT THE FISHES OF INDIA DID NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY WERE FOUND UPON THE GROUND AFTER TORRENTIAL RAINS BECAUSE STREAMS HAD OVERFLOWED AND HAD THEN RECEDED
3240-131231-0058 IN THE REGION OF INERTNESS THAT WE THINK WE CAN CONCEIVE OF OR A ZONE THAT IS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION VERY MUCH LIKE THE NEUTRAL ZONE OF A MAGNET'S ATTRACTION WE ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE BODIES OF WATER AND ALSO CLEAR SPACES BOTTOMS OF PONDS DROPPING OUT
3240-131231-0059 REMAIN AND DRY OR EVEN PUTREFY THEN SOMETIMES FALLING BY ATMOSPHERIC DISLODGMENT AFTER A TREMENDOUS DELUGE OF RAIN ONE OF THE HEAVIEST FALLS ON RECORD
3240-131231-0060 JULY TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY
3240-131231-0061 THE WORD FOUND IS AGREEABLE TO THE REPULSIONS OF THE CONVENTIONALISTS AND THEIR CONCEPT OF AN OVERFLOWING STREAM BUT ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE FOUND ON THE TOPS OF HAYSTACKS FERREL
3240-131231-0062 TELLS OF A FALL OF LIVING FISHES SOME OF THEM HAVING BEEN PLACED IN A TANK WHERE THEY SURVIVED THAT OCCURRED IN INDIA ABOUT TWENTY MILES SOUTH OF CALCUTTA SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE A WITNESS OF THIS FALL SAYS
3240-131231-0063 THE MOST STRANGE THING WHICH EVER STRUCK ME WAS THAT THE FISH DID NOT FALL HELTER SKELTER OR HERE AND THERE BUT THEY FELL IN A STRAIGHT LINE NOT MORE THAN A CUBIT IN BREADTH
3240-131231-0064 THAT ACCORDING TO TESTIMONY TAKEN BEFORE A MAGISTRATE A FALL OCCURRED FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NEAR FERIDPOOR INDIA OF MANY FISHES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME WHOLE AND FRESH AND OTHERS MUTILATED AND PUTREFYING
3240-131231-0065 OR TO THOSE WHO HOLD OUT FOR SEGREGATION IN A WHIRLWIND OR THAT OBJECTS SAY TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE LIGHTER WE POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS IN THE JOURNAL OF THE ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL
3240-131231-0066 SOME OF THE FISH WERE FRESH BUT OTHERS WERE ROTTEN AND WITHOUT HEADS AMONG THE NUMBER WHICH I GOT FIVE WERE FRESH AND THE REST STINKING AND HEADLESS THEY REMIND US OF HIS GRACE'S OBSERVATION OF SOME PAGES BACK
3240-131231-0067 ACCORDING TO DOCTOR BUIST SOME OF THESE FISHES WEIGHED ONE AND A HALF POUNDS EACH AND OTHERS THREE POUNDS A FALL OF FISHES AT FUTTEPOOR INDIA MAY SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE THEY WERE ALL DEAD AND DRY
3240-131231-0068 A CORRESPONDENT WRITES FROM THE DOVE MARINE LABORATORY CUTTERCOATS ENGLAND THAT AT HINDON A SUBURB OF SUNDERLAND AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS OF SMALL FISHES IDENTIFIED AS SAND EELS HAD FALLEN
3240-131231-0069 AGAIN THE SMALL AREA ABOUT SIXTY BY THIRTY YARDS THE FALL OCCURRED DURING A HEAVY RAIN THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER
3240-131231-0070 BUT BY NO VISIBLE LIGHTNING THE SEA IS CLOSE TO HINDON BUT IF YOU TRY TO THINK OF THESE FISHES HAVING DESCRIBED A TRAJECTORY IN A WHIRLWIND FROM THE OCEAN CONSIDER THIS REMARKABLE DATUM THAT
3240-131231-0071 ACCORDING TO WITNESSES THE FALL UPON THIS SMALL AREA OCCUPIED TEN MINUTES I CANNOT THINK OF A CLEARER INDICATION OF A DIRECT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND
3240-131231-0072 THE FISH WERE ALL DEAD AND INDEED STIFF AND HARD WHEN PICKED UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OCCURRENCE BY ALL OF WHICH I MEAN THAT WE HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO PILE UP OUR DATA OF THINGS THAT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE OVERHEAD
3240-131231-0073 WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE UP THE SUBJECT FROM MANY APPROACHES BEFORE OUR ACCEPTANCE WHICH SEEMS QUITE AS RIGOROUSLY ARRIVED AT AS EVER HAS BEEN A BELIEF CAN EMERGE FROM THE ACCURSED I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE HORSE AND THE BARN WILL HELP US TO EMERGE
3240-131231-0074 BUT IF EVER ANYTHING DID GO UP FROM THIS EARTH'S SURFACE AND STAY UP THOSE DAMNED THINGS MAY HAVE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN A TORNADO IN WISCONSIN MAY TWENTY THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0075 A BARN AND A HORSE WERE CARRIED COMPLETELY AWAY AND NEITHER HORSE NOR BARN NOR ANY PORTION OF EITHER HAVE SINCE BEEN FOUND AFTER THAT WHICH WOULD BE A LITTLE STRONG WERE IT NOT FOR A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN OUR DIGESTIONS THAT I NOTE AS WE GO ALONG
3240-131231-0076 THERE IS LITTLE OF THE BIZARRE OR THE UNASSIMILABLE IN THE TURTLE THAT HOVERED SIX MONTHS OR SO OVER A SMALL TOWN IN MISSISSIPPI MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131231-0077 FELL A SMALL PIECE OF ALABASTER THAT AT BOVINA EIGHT MILES FROM VICKSBURG FELL A GOPHER TURTLE THEY FELL IN A HAILSTORM THIS ITEM WAS WIDELY COPIED AT THE TIME FOR INSTANCE NATURE
3240-131231-0078 AS TO DISCUSSION NOT A WORD OR SCIENCE AND ITS CONTINUITY WITH PRESBYTERIANISM DATA LIKE THIS ARE DAMNED AT BIRTH THE WEATHER REVIEW DOES SPRINKLE OR BAPTIZE OR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THIS INFANT
3240-131231-0079 BUT IN ALL THE METEOROLOGICAL LITERATURE THAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH AFTER THAT DATE NOT A WORD EXCEPT MENTION ONCE OR TWICE THE EDITOR OF THE REVIEW SAYS
3240-131231-0080 AN EXAMINATION OF THE WEATHER MAP SHOWS THAT THESE HAILSTORMS OCCUR ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF A REGION OF COLD NORTHERLY WINDS AND WERE BUT A SMALL PART OF A SERIES OF SIMILAR STORMS
3240-131231-0081 OF ALL INCREDIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM I GIVE FIRST PLACE TO A NOTION OF A WHIRLWIND POUNCING UPON A REGION
3240-131231-0082 THIS TIME THE OTHER MECHANICAL THING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE CANNOT RISE IN RESPONSE TO ITS STIMULUS IT IS RESISTED IN THAT THESE OBJECTS WERE COATED WITH ICE MONTH OF MAY IN A SOUTHERN STATE IF A WHIRLWIND AT ALL
3240-131231-0083 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED SELECTION THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE FALL OF OTHER OBJECTS BUT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT IN THE REVIEW TO SPECIFY A WHIRLWIND THESE STRANGELY ASSOCIATED THINGS WERE REMARKABLY SEPARATED THEY FELL EIGHT MILES APART
3240-131231-0084 THEN AS IF THERE WERE REAL REASONING THEY MUST HAVE BEEN HIGH TO FALL WITH SUCH DIVERGENCE OR ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED PARTLY HORIZONTALLY EIGHT MILES FARTHER THAN THE OTHER BUT EITHER SUPPOSITION ARGUES FOR POWER MORE THAN THAT OF A LOCAL WHIRL OR GUST
3240-131231-0085 OR ARGUES FOR A GREAT SPECIFIC DISTURBANCE OF WHICH THERE IS NO RECORD FOR THE MONTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
3240-131232-0000 THEN I THINK OF A HURRICANE THAT OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WEEKS OR MONTHS BEFORE MAY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR NO I DON'T LOOK FOR IT AND INEVITABLY FIND IT OR THAT THINGS CAN GO UP SO HIGH IN HURRICANES THAT THEY STAY UP INDEFINITELY
3240-131232-0001 BUT MAY AFTER A WHILE BE SHAKEN DOWN BY STORMS
3240-131232-0002 SO THEN THAT THE TURTLE AND THE PIECE OF ALABASTER MAY HAVE HAD FAR DIFFERENT ORIGINS FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS PERHAPS HAVE ENTERED A REGION OF SUSPENSION OVER THIS EARTH WAFTING NEAR EACH OTHER LONG DURATION
3240-131232-0003 FINAL PRECIPITATION BY ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WITH HAIL OR THAT HAILSTONES TOO WHEN LARGE ARE PHENOMENA OF SUSPENSION OF LONG DURATION THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE VERY LARGE ONES COULD BECOME SO GREAT ONLY IN FALLING FROM THE CLOUDS
3240-131232-0004 LONG DURATION OTHER INDICATIONS OF LONG DURATION I THINK OF A REGION SOMEWHERE ABOVE THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN WHICH GRAVITATION IS INOPERATIVE AND IS NOT GOVERNED BY THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE
3240-131232-0005 QUITE AS MAGNETISM IS NEGLIGIBLE AT A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FROM A MAGNET THEORETICALLY THE ATTRACTION OF A MAGNET SHOULD DECREASE WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BUT THE FALLING OFF IS FOUND TO BE ALMOST ABRUPT AT A SHORT DISTANCE
3240-131232-0006 HORSES AND BARNS AND ELEPHANTS AND FLIES AND DODOES MOAS AND PTERODACTYLS LEAVES FROM MODERN TREES AND LEAVES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS ERA ALL HOWEVER TENDING TO DISINTEGRATE INTO HOMOGENEOUS LOOKING MUDS OR DUSTS
3240-131232-0007 RED OR BLACK OR YELLOW TREASURE TROVES FOR THE PALAEONTOLOGISTS AND FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ACCUMULATIONS OF CENTURIES CYCLONES OF EGYPT GREECE AND ASSYRIA FISHES DRIED AND HARD THERE A SHORT TIME OTHERS THERE LONG ENOUGH TO PUTREFY
3240-131232-0008 BUT THE OMNIPRESENCE OF HETEROGENEITY OR LIVING FISHES ALSO PONDS OF FRESH WATER OCEANS OF SALT WATER AS TO THE LAW OF GRAVITATION I PREFER TO TAKE ONE SIMPLE STAND
3240-131232-0009 ORTHODOXY ACCEPTS THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES GRAVITATION IS ONE OF THESE FORCES ALL OTHER FORCES HAVE PHENOMENA OF REPULSION AND OF INERTNESS IRRESPECTIVE OF DISTANCE AS WELL AS OF ATTRACTION
3240-131232-0010 BUT NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION ADMITS ATTRACTION ONLY THEN NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION CAN BE ONLY ONE THIRD ACCEPTABLE EVEN TO THE ORTHODOX OR THERE IS DENIAL OF THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES OR STILL SIMPLER HERE ARE THE DATA
3240-131232-0011 THOUGH IT HARMONIZES WITH DATA OF FISHES THAT FALL AS IF FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND OF COURSE WITH OTHER DATA TOO IS INADEQUATE TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO PECULIARITIES OF THE FALLS OF FROGS THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF TADPOLES BEEN REPORTED
3240-131232-0012 THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF FULL GROWN FROGS BEEN REPORTED ALWAYS FROGS A FEW MONTHS OLD IT SOUNDS POSITIVE BUT IF THERE BE SUCH REPORTS THEY ARE SOMEWHERE OUT OF MY RANGE OF READING BUT TADPOLES WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SKY THAN WOULD FROGS
3240-131232-0013 LITTLE OR BIG IF SUCH FALLS BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHIRLWINDS AND MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA IF THOUGH VERY TENTATIVELY AND PROVISIONALLY WE ACCEPT THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA
3240-131232-0014 BEFORE WE TAKE UP AN ESPECIAL EXPRESSION UPON THE FALL OF IMMATURE AND LARVAL FORMS OF LIFE TO THIS EARTH AND THE NECESSITY THEN OF CONCEIVING OF SOME FACTOR BESIDES MERE STATIONARINESS OR SUSPENSION OR STAGNATION
3240-131232-0015 THERE ARE OTHER DATA THAT ARE SIMILAR TO DATA OF FALLS OF FISHES SCIENCE GOSSIP
3240-131232-0016 THAT SMALL SNAILS OF A LAND SPECIES HAD FALLEN NEAR REDRUTH CORNWALL JULY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX DURING A HEAVY THUNDERSTORM ROADS AND FIELDS STREWN WITH THEM SO THAT THEY WERE GATHERED UP BY THE HATFUL
3240-131232-0017 NONE SEEN TO FALL BY THE WRITER OF THIS ACCOUNT SNAILS SAID TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT TO ANY PREVIOUSLY KNOWN IN THIS DISTRICT
3240-131232-0018 OF GREAT AND DESERVED REPUTE I THOUGHT I SHOULD FOR ONCE LIKE TO TRACE THE ORIGIN OF ONE OF THESE FABULOUS TALES OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE IS THAT JUSTICE CANNOT BE IN AN INTERMEDIATE EXISTENCE
3240-131232-0019 IN WHICH THERE CAN BE APPROXIMATION ONLY TO JUSTICE OR TO INJUSTICE THAT TO BE FAIR IS TO HAVE NO OPINION AT ALL THAT TO BE HONEST IS TO BE UNINTERESTED THAT TO INVESTIGATE IS TO ADMIT PREJUDICE THAT NOBODY HAS EVER REALLY INVESTIGATED ANYTHING
3240-131232-0020 BUT HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT POSITIVELY TO PROVE OR TO DISPROVE SOMETHING THAT WAS CONCEIVED OF OR SUSPECTED IN ADVANCE AS I SUSPECTED SAYS THIS CORRESPONDENT I FOUND THAT THE SNAILS WERE OF A FAMILIAR LAND SPECIES THAT THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND
3240-131232-0021 IN THE FIRST PLACE HE FOUND THAT THE SNAILS HAD APPEARED AFTER THE RAIN THAT ASTONISHED RUSTICS HAD JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY HAD FALLEN HE MET ONE PERSON WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN THE SNAILS FALL THIS WAS HIS ERROR SAYS THE INVESTIGATOR
3240-131232-0022 IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT THEY WERE SHOVELED UP IT IS SAID THAT THE SNAILS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A LOCAL SPECIES
3240-131232-0023 AND THAT IN HIS OPINION THEY HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME UNUSUAL CONDITION ALOFT COMES OUT IN HIS OBSERVATION UPON THE CURIOUS AZURE BLUE APPEARANCE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME
3240-131232-0024 THAT ACCORDING TO DAS WETTER DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO UPON AUGUST NINTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A YELLOW CLOUD APPEARED OVER PADERBORN GERMANY FROM THIS CLOUD FELL A TORRENTIAL RAIN IN WHICH WERE HUNDREDS OF MUSSELS
3240-131232-0025 THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE NOR OF A WHIRLWIND LIZARDS
3240-131232-0026 THAT DURING A HEAVY SHOWER JULY THIRD EIGHTEEN SIXTY HE HEARD A PECULIAR SOUND AT HIS FEET AND LOOKING DOWN SAW A SNAKE LYING AS IF STUNNED BY A FALL IT THEN CAME TO LIFE GRAY SNAKE ABOUT A FOOT LONG
3240-131232-0027 THESE DATA HAVE ANY MEANING OR LACK OF MEANING OR DEGREE OF DAMNATION YOU PLEASE BUT IN THE MATTER OF THE FALL THAT OCCURRED AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE OCCUR SOME STRONG SIGNIFICANCES
3240-131232-0028 OUR QUASI REASONING UPON THIS SUBJECT APPLIES TO ALL SEGREGATIONS SO FAR CONSIDERED MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT
3240-131232-0029 RATHER STRICTLY LOCALIZED OR IN A SPACE OF TWO BLOCKS AND AFTER A VIOLENT STORM IN WHICH THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS SNAKES WERE FOUND THEY WERE CRAWLING ON SIDEWALKS IN YARDS AND IN STREETS AND IN MASSES
3240-131232-0030 BUT NONE WERE FOUND ON ROOFS OR ANY OTHER ELEVATION ABOVE GROUND AND NONE WERE SEEN TO FALL IF YOU PREFER TO BELIEVE THAT THE SNAKES HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE OR HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THAT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO CALL SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEM
3240-131232-0031 IN THE STREETS OF MEMPHIS JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHY THAT'S SENSIBLE THAT'S THE COMMON SENSE THAT HAS BEEN AGAINST US FROM THE FIRST IT IS NOT SAID WHETHER THE SNAKES WERE OF A KNOWN SPECIES OR NOT
3240-131232-0032 AND HAD NOT BEEN IN THE STREETS CRAWLING LOOSE OR IN THICK TANGLED MASSES IN THE FIRST PLACE IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT THESE SNAKES HAD BEEN RAISED FROM SOME OTHER PART OF THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN A WHIRLWIND IF WE TRY TO ACCEPT THAT A WHIRLWIND COULD SEGREGATE THEM
3240-131232-0033 STONES FENCE RAILS LIMBS OF TREES SAY THAT THE SNAKES OCCUPIED THE NEXT GRADATION AND WOULD BE THE NEXT TO FALL
3240-131232-0034 AGAIN OURS IS THE OBJECTION AGAINST SUCH SELECTIVENESS BY A WHIRLWIND CONCEIVABLY A WHIRLWIND COULD SCOOP OUT A DEN OF HIBERNATING SNAKES WITH STONES AND EARTH AND AN INFINITUDE OF OTHER DEBRIS SNATCHING UP DOZENS OF SNAKES
3240-131232-0035 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TO A DEN HUNDREDS MAYBE BUT ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNT OF THIS OCCURRENCE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM ALIVE FROM ONE FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN LENGTH
3240-131232-0036 RECORDS THE FALL AND SAYS THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM THE USUAL WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION IS GIVEN BUT IN WHAT LOCALITY SNAKES EXIST IN SUCH ABUNDANCE IS YET A MYSTERY THIS MATTER OF ENORMOUSNESS OF NUMBERS
3240-131232-0037 SUGGESTS TO ME SOMETHING OF A MIGRATORY NATURE BUT THAT SNAKES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT MIGRATE IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IF EVER AS TO FALLS OR FLUTTERINGS OF WINGED INSECTS FROM THE SKY PREVAILING NOTIONS OF SWARMING WOULD SEEM EXPLANATORY ENOUGH
3240-131232-0038 FALL OF FISHES JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE IN HOLLAND ANTS AUGUST FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE STRASBOURG LITTLE TOADS AUGUST SECOND EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE SAVOY
3240-131232-0039 FALL OF ANTS CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR SOME WERE WINGLESS
3240-131232-0040 ENORMOUS FALL OF ANTS NANCY FRANCE JULY TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MOST OF THEM WERE WINGLESS
