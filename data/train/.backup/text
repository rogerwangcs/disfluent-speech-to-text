26-495-0000 IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WRITTEN BY A CITIZEN WHO CONTINUED ALL THE WHILE IN LONDON NEVER MADE PUBLIC BEFORE
26-495-0001 IT WAS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT I AMONG THE REST OF MY NEIGHBOURS HEARD IN ORDINARY DISCOURSE THAT THE PLAGUE WAS RETURNED AGAIN IN HOLLAND
26-495-0002 IT WAS BROUGHT SOME SAID FROM ITALY OTHERS FROM THE LEVANT AMONG SOME GOODS WHICH WERE BROUGHT HOME BY THEIR TURKEY FLEET OTHERS SAID IT WAS BROUGHT FROM CANDIA OTHERS FROM CYPRUS
26-495-0003 SPREAD RUMOURS AND REPORTS OF THINGS AND TO IMPROVE THEM BY THE INVENTION OF MEN AS I HAVE LIVED TO SEE PRACTISED SINCE
26-495-0004 AND FROM THEM WAS HANDED ABOUT BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY SO THAT THINGS DID NOT SPREAD INSTANTLY OVER THE WHOLE NATION AS THEY DO NOW BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT OF IT
26-495-0005 AND SEVERAL COUNCILS WERE HELD ABOUT WAYS TO PREVENT ITS COMING OVER BUT ALL WAS KEPT VERY PRIVATE HENCE IT WAS THAT THIS RUMOUR DIED OFF AGAIN AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO FORGET IT AS A THING WE WERE VERY LITTLE CONCERNED IN
26-495-0006 AND THAT WE HOPED WAS NOT TRUE TILL THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER OR THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN TWO MEN SAID TO BE FRENCHMEN DIED OF THE PLAGUE IN LONG ACRE
26-495-0007 OR RATHER AT THE UPPER END OF DRURY LANE
26-495-0008 ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT AS IT HAD GOTTEN SOME VENT IN THE DISCOURSE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE SECRETARIES OF STATE GOT KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND CONCERNING THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE ABOUT IT IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN OF THE TRUTH
26-495-0009 TWO PHYSICIANS AND A SURGEON WERE ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE AND MAKE INSPECTION THIS THEY DID AND FINDING EVIDENT TOKENS OF THE SICKNESS UPON BOTH THE BODIES THAT WERE DEAD
26-495-0010 AND IT WAS PRINTED IN THE WEEKLY BILL OF MORTALITY IN THE USUAL MANNER THUS PLAGUE TWO PARISHES INFECTED ONE
26-495-0011 BUT AFTER THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY ANOTHER DIED IN ANOTHER HOUSE BUT IN THE SAME PARISH AND IN THE SAME MANNER THIS TURNED THE PEOPLE'S EYES PRETTY MUCH TOWARDS THAT END OF THE TOWN
26-495-0012 IT BEGAN TO BE SUSPECTED THAT THE PLAGUE WAS AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THAT END OF THE TOWN AND THAT MANY HAD DIED OF IT THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT AS MUCH FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE
26-495-0013 THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
26-495-0014 THE USUAL NUMBER OF BURIALS IN A WEEK IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES IN THE FIELDS AND SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN WERE FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN OR NINETEEN EACH FEW MORE OR LESS
26-495-0015 IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE ORDINARY BURIALS INCREASED IN NUMBER CONSIDERABLY FOR EXAMPLE FROM DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH TO JANUARY THIRD
26-495-0016 THE LIKE INCREASE OF THE BILLS WAS OBSERVED IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT BRIDE'S ADJOINING ON ONE SIDE OF HOLBORN PARISH AND IN THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES CLERKENWELL ADJOINING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOLBORN
26-495-0017 SAINT BRIDE'S ZERO SAINT JAMES'S EIGHT
26-495-0018 SAINT BRIDE'S SIX SAINT JAMES'S NINE
26-495-0019 SAINT JAMES'S SEVEN
26-495-0020 SAINT BRIDE'S EIGHT
26-495-0021 SAINT JAMES'S SIX BESIDES THIS IT WAS OBSERVED WITH GREAT UNEASINESS BY THE PEOPLE THAT THE WEEKLY BILLS IN GENERAL INCREASED VERY MUCH DURING THESE WEEKS ALTHOUGH IT WAS AT A TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN
26-495-0022 IN ONE WEEK SINCE THE PRECEDING VISITATION OF SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX HOWEVER ALL THIS WENT OFF AGAIN AND THE WEATHER PROVING COLD AND THE FROST WHICH BEGAN IN DECEMBER
26-495-0023 STILL CONTINUING VERY SEVERE EVEN TILL NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY ATTENDED WITH SHARP THOUGH MODERATE WINDS THE BILLS DECREASED AGAIN AND THE CITY GREW HEALTHY AND EVERYBODY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE DANGER AS GOOD AS OVER
26-495-0024 FROM THE BEGINNING OF APRIL ESPECIALLY THEY STOOD AT TWENTY FIVE EACH WEEK TILL THE WEEK FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE TWENTY FIFTH
26-495-0025 THERE WAS NONE OF THE PLAGUE AND BUT FOUR OF THE SPOTTED FEVER BUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT RETURNED AGAIN AND THE DISTEMPER WAS SPREAD INTO TWO OR THREE OTHER PARISHES
26-495-0026 NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS ALREADY INFECTED THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MAY YET THE WEATHER WAS TEMPERATE VARIABLE AND COOL ENOUGH AND PEOPLE HAD STILL SOME HOPES THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED THEM WAS THAT THE CITY WAS HEALTHY
26-495-0027 THERE DIED BUT THREE OF WHICH NOT ONE WITHIN THE WHOLE CITY OR LIBERTIES AND SAINT ANDREW'S BURIED BUT FIFTEEN WHICH WAS VERY LOW
26-495-0028 BUT STILL AS THERE WAS BUT ONE OF THE PLAGUE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BE EASY THE WHOLE BILL ALSO WAS VERY LOW FOR THE WEEK BEFORE THE BILL WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN
26-495-0029 SO THAT NOW ALL OUR EXTENUATIONS ABATED AND IT WAS NO MORE TO BE CONCEALED NAY IT QUICKLY APPEARED THAT THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD ITSELF BEYOND ALL HOPES OF ABATEMENT THAT IN THE PARISH OF SAINT GILES
26-495-0030 BUT THIS WAS ALL KNAVERY AND COLLUSION
26-495-0031 YET THERE WAS FOURTEEN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER AS WELL AS FOURTEEN OF THE PLAGUE
26-495-0032 UPON THE WHOLE THAT THERE WERE FIFTY DIED THAT WEEK OF THE PLAGUE THE NEXT BILL WAS FROM THE TWENTY THIRD OF MAY TO THE THIRTIETH WHEN THE NUMBER OF THE PLAGUE WAS SEVENTEEN BUT
26-495-0033 A FRIGHTFUL NUMBER OF WHOM THEY SET DOWN BUT NINE OF THE PLAGUE BUT ON AN EXAMINATION MORE STRICTLY BY THE JUSTICES OF PEACE AND AT THE LORD MAYOR'S REQUEST
26-495-0034 TWENTY MORE WHO WERE REALLY DEAD OF THE PLAGUE IN THAT PARISH BUT HAD BEEN SET DOWN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER OR OTHER DISTEMPERS BESIDES OTHERS CONCEALED
26-495-0035 OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTINUED VERY EASY BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN THEIR CONSTERNATION WAS VERY GREAT AND THE RICHER SORT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY FROM THE WEST PART OF THE CITY
26-495-0036 IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER AND THIS WAS MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN IN WHITECHAPPEL THAT IS TO SAY THE BROAD STREET WHERE I LIVED INDEED NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT WAGGONS AND CARTS WITH GOODS
26-495-0037 COACHES FILLED WITH PEOPLE OF THE BETTER SORT AND HORSEMEN ATTENDING THEM AND ALL HURRYING AWAY THEN EMPTY WAGGONS AND CARTS APPEARED AND SPARE HORSES WITH SERVANTS WHO IT WAS APPARENT
26-495-0038 WERE RETURNING OR SENT FROM THE COUNTRIES TO FETCH MORE PEOPLE BESIDES INNUMERABLE NUMBERS OF MEN ON HORSEBACK SOME ALONE OTHERS WITH SERVANTS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING
26-495-0039 AS ANYONE MIGHT PERCEIVE BY THEIR APPEARANCE THIS WAS A VERY TERRIBLE AND MELANCHOLY THING TO SEE AND AS IT WAS A SIGHT WHICH I COULD NOT BUT LOOK ON FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
26-495-0040 THIS HURRY OF THE PEOPLE WAS SUCH FOR SOME WEEKS THAT THERE WAS NO GETTING AT THE LORD MAYOR'S DOOR WITHOUT EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY THERE WERE SUCH PRESSING AND CROWDING THERE
26-495-0041 TO GET PASSES AND CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH FOR SUCH AS TRAVELLED ABROAD FOR WITHOUT THESE THERE WAS NO BEING ADMITTED TO PASS THROUGH THE TOWNS UPON THE ROAD OR TO LODGE IN ANY INN
26-495-0042 NOW AS THERE HAD NONE DIED IN THE CITY FOR ALL THIS TIME MY LORD MAYOR GAVE CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY TO ALL THOSE WHO LIVED IN THE NINETY SEVEN PARISHES AND TO THOSE WITHIN THE LIBERTIES TOO
26-495-0043 THIS HURRY I SAY CONTINUED SOME WEEKS THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MONTH OF MAY AND JUNE AND THE MORE BECAUSE IT WAS RUMOURED THAT AN ORDER OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE ISSUED OUT
26-495-0044 TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
26-495-0045 CONCERNING MY OWN CASE AND HOW I SHOULD DISPOSE OF MYSELF THAT IS TO SAY WHETHER I SHOULD RESOLVE TO STAY IN LONDON OR SHUT UP MY HOUSE AND FLEE AS MANY OF MY NEIGHBOURS DID I HAVE SET THIS PARTICULAR DOWN
26-495-0046 SO FULLY BECAUSE I KNOW NOT BUT IT MAY BE OF MOMENT TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER ME IF THEY COME TO BE BROUGHT TO THE SAME DISTRESS AND TO THE SAME MANNER OF MAKING THEIR CHOICE AND THEREFORE
26-495-0047 TO NOTE WHAT BECAME OF ME I HAD TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BEFORE ME
26-495-0048 WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE AND IN WHICH WAS EMBARKED ALL MY EFFECTS IN THE WORLD AND THE OTHER WAS THE PRESERVATION OF MY LIFE IN SO DISMAL A CALAMITY AS I SAW APPARENTLY WAS COMING UPON THE WHOLE CITY AND WHICH
26-495-0049 HOWEVER GREAT IT WAS MY FEARS PERHAPS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE'S REPRESENTED TO BE MUCH GREATER THAN IT COULD BE
26-495-0050 MY TRADE WAS A SADDLER AND AS MY DEALINGS WERE CHIEFLY NOT BY A SHOP OR CHANCE TRADE BUT AMONG THE MERCHANTS TRADING TO THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN AMERICA SO MY EFFECTS LAY VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF SUCH
26-495-0051 BUT I HAD A FAMILY OF SERVANTS WHOM I KEPT AT MY BUSINESS HAD A HOUSE SHOP AND WAREHOUSES FILLED WITH GOODS AND IN SHORT TO LEAVE THEM ALL AS THINGS IN SUCH A CASE MUST BE LEFT THAT IS TO SAY
26-495-0052 WITHOUT ANY OVERSEER OR PERSON FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH THEM HAD BEEN TO HAZARD THE LOSS NOT ONLY OF MY TRADE BUT OF MY GOODS AND INDEED OF ALL I HAD IN THE WORLD I HAD AN ELDER BROTHER
26-495-0053 AT THE SAME TIME IN LONDON AND NOT MANY YEARS BEFORE COME OVER FROM PORTUGAL AND ADVISING WITH HIM HIS ANSWER WAS IN THREE WORDS
26-495-0054 THAT THE BEST PREPARATION FOR THE PLAGUE WAS TO RUN AWAY FROM IT AS TO MY ARGUMENT OF LOSING MY TRADE MY GOODS OR DEBTS HE QUITE CONFUTED ME HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING WHICH
26-495-0055 FOR SAYS HE IS IT NOT AS REASONABLE THAT YOU SHOULD TRUST GOD WITH THE CHANCE OR RISK OF LOSING YOUR TRADE AS THAT YOU SHOULD STAY IN SO EMINENT A POINT OF DANGER AND TRUST HIM WITH YOUR LIFE I COULD NOT
26-495-0056 I SAY AS MANY DID BECAUSE SEVERAL DID SO AT LAST ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE ARMIES IN THE WAR WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MANY YEARS PAST AND I MUST NEEDS SAY THAT SPEAKING OF SECOND CAUSES
26-495-0057 HAD MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT TRAVELLED DONE SO THE PLAGUE HAD NOT BEEN CARRIED INTO SO MANY COUNTRY TOWNS AND HOUSES AS IT WAS TO THE GREAT DAMAGE AND INDEED TO THE RUIN OF ABUNDANCE OF PEOPLE
26-495-0058 BUT THEN MY SERVANT WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO TAKE DOWN WITH ME DECEIVED ME AND BEING FRIGHTED AT THE INCREASE OF THE DISTEMPER AND NOT KNOWING WHEN I SHOULD GO HE TOOK OTHER MEASURES AND LEFT ME
26-495-0059 SO I WAS PUT OFF FOR THAT TIME AND ONE WAY OR OTHER I ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO APPOINT TO GO AWAY WAS ALWAYS CROSSED BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER SO AS TO DISAPPOINT AND PUT IT OFF AGAIN
26-495-0060 ABOUT THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BEING FROM HEAVEN I MENTION THIS STORY ALSO AS THE BEST METHOD I CAN ADVISE ANY PERSON TO TAKE IN SUCH A CASE ESPECIALLY IF HE BE ONE THAT MAKES CONSCIENCE OF HIS DUTY
26-495-0061 AND WOULD BE DIRECTED WHAT TO DO IN IT NAMELY THAT HE SHOULD KEEP HIS EYE UPON THE PARTICULAR PROVIDENCES WHICH OCCUR AT THAT TIME AND LOOK UPON THEM COMPLEXLY AS THEY REGARD ONE ANOTHER
26-495-0062 AND AS ALL TOGETHER REGARD THE QUESTION BEFORE HIM AND THEN I THINK HE MAY SAFELY TAKE THEM FOR INTIMATIONS FROM HEAVEN OF WHAT IS HIS UNQUESTIONED DUTY TO DO IN SUCH A CASE I MEAN
26-495-0063 SO THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM EXTRAORDINARY AND I OUGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT DID NOT EVIDENTLY POINT OUT OR INTIMATE TO ME THAT IT WAS THE WILL OF HEAVEN I SHOULD NOT GO
26-495-0064 THAT WOULD SURROUND ME AND THAT IF I ATTEMPTED TO SECURE MYSELF BY FLEEING FROM MY HABITATION AND ACTED CONTRARY TO THESE INTIMATIONS WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE DIVINE IT WAS A KIND OF
26-495-0065 FLYING FROM GOD AND THAT HE COULD CAUSE HIS JUSTICE TO OVERTAKE ME WHEN AND WHERE HE THOUGHT FIT THESE THOUGHTS QUITE TURNED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN AND WHEN I CAME TO DISCOURSE WITH MY BROTHER AGAIN
26-495-0066 I TOLD HIM THAT I INCLINED TO STAY AND TAKE MY LOT IN THAT STATION IN WHICH GOD HAD PLACED ME AND THAT IT SEEMED TO BE MADE MORE ESPECIALLY MY DUTY ON THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT I HAVE SAID
26-495-0067 MY BROTHER THOUGH A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN HIMSELF LAUGHED AT ALL I HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT ITS BEING AN INTIMATION FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD ME SEVERAL STORIES OF SUCH FOOLHARDY PEOPLE AS HE CALLED THEM
26-495-0068 AS I WAS THAT I OUGHT INDEED TO SUBMIT TO IT AS A WORK OF HEAVEN IF I HAD BEEN ANY WAY DISABLED BY DISTEMPERS OR DISEASES AND THAT THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO GO
26-495-0069 I OUGHT TO ACQUIESCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIM WHO HAVING BEEN MY MAKER HAD AN UNDISPUTED RIGHT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN DISPOSING OF ME AND THAT THEN THERE HAD BEEN
26-495-0070 ONLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT HIRE A HORSE TO GO OR MY FELLOW WAS RUN AWAY THAT WAS TO ATTEND ME WAS RIDICULOUS SINCE AT THE TIME I HAD MY HEALTH AND LIMBS AND OTHER SERVANTS AND MIGHT
26-495-0071 AND IN OTHER PLACES WHERE HE HAD BEEN FOR MY BROTHER BEING A MERCHANT WAS A FEW YEARS BEFORE AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED RETURNED FROM ABROAD COMING LAST FROM LISBON AND HOW
26-495-0072 THEY WOULD GO UNCONCERNED INTO INFECTED PLACES AND CONVERSE WITH INFECTED PERSONS BY WHICH MEANS THEY DIED AT THE RATE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND A WEEK
26-495-0073 WHEREAS THE EUROPEANS OR CHRISTIAN MERCHANTS WHO KEPT THEMSELVES RETIRED AND RESERVED GENERALLY ESCAPED THE CONTAGION UPON THESE ARGUMENTS MY BROTHER CHANGED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN
26-495-0074 AND I BEGAN TO RESOLVE TO GO AND ACCORDINGLY MADE ALL THINGS READY FOR IN SHORT THE INFECTION INCREASED ROUND ME
26-495-0075 AND AS I HAD ALREADY PREPARED EVERYTHING AS WELL AS I COULD AS TO MY BUSINESS AND WHOM TO ENTRUST MY AFFAIRS WITH I HAD LITTLE TO DO BUT TO RESOLVE I WENT HOME THAT EVENING GREATLY OPPRESSED IN MY MIND
26-495-0076 IRRESOLUTE AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I HAD SET THE EVENING WHOLLY APART TO CONSIDER SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT AND WAS ALL ALONE FOR ALREADY PEOPLE HAD AS IT WERE BY A GENERAL CONSENT
26-495-0077 WHAT WAS MY DUTY TO DO AND I STATED THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH MY BROTHER HAD PRESSED ME TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND I SET AGAINST THEM THE STRONG IMPRESSIONS WHICH I HAD ON MY MIND FOR STAYING THE VISIBLE CALL I SEEMED TO HAVE
26-495-0078 FROM THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY CALLING AND THE CARE DUE FROM ME FOR THE PRESERVATION OF MY EFFECTS WHICH WERE AS I MIGHT SAY MY ESTATE ALSO THE INTIMATIONS WHICH I THOUGHT
26-495-0079 I OBEYED THIS LAY CLOSE TO ME AND MY MIND SEEMED MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED TO STAY THAN EVER AND SUPPORTED WITH A SECRET SATISFACTION THAT I SHOULD BE KEPT ADD TO THIS THAT
26-495-0080 AND AT THAT JUNCTURE I HAPPENED TO STOP TURNING OVER THE BOOK
26-495-0081 I READ ON TO THE SEVENTH VERSE EXCLUSIVE AND AFTER THAT INCLUDED THE TENTH AS FOLLOWS I WILL SAY OF THE LORD HE IS MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS MY GOD
26-495-0082 IN HIM WILL I TRUST SURELY HE SHALL DELIVER THEE FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER AND FROM THE NOISOME PESTILENCE HE SHALL COVER THEE WITH HIS FEATHERS AND UNDER HIS WINGS SHALT THOU TRUST
26-495-0083 BECAUSE THOU HAST MADE THE LORD WHICH IS MY REFUGE EVEN THE MOST HIGH THY HABITATION THERE SHALL NO EVIL BEFALL THEE NEITHER SHALL ANY PLAGUE COME NIGH THY DWELLING
26-495-0084 HE WAS AS ABLE TO KEEP ME IN A TIME OF THE INFECTION AS IN A TIME OF HEALTH AND IF HE DID NOT THINK FIT TO DELIVER ME STILL I WAS IN HIS HANDS
26-495-0085 AND IT WAS MEET HE SHOULD DO WITH ME AS SHOULD SEEM GOOD TO HIM WITH THIS RESOLUTION I WENT TO BED
26-495-0086 THE WOMAN BEING TAKEN ILL WITH WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO ENTRUST MY HOUSE AND ALL MY AFFAIRS
26-495-0087 AND AFTERWARDS FETCHED A ROUND FARTHER INTO BUCKINGHAMSHIRE OR BEDFORDSHIRE TO A RETREAT HE HAD FOUND OUT THERE FOR HIS FAMILY IT WAS A VERY ILL TIME TO BE SICK IN
26-495-0088 FOR IF ANY ONE COMPLAINED IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SAID HE HAD THE PLAGUE
26-495-0089 YET BEING VERY ILL BOTH IN MY HEAD AND IN MY STOMACH I WAS NOT WITHOUT APPREHENSION THAT I REALLY WAS INFECTED BUT IN ABOUT THREE DAYS I GREW BETTER THE THIRD NIGHT I RESTED WELL
26-495-0090 SWEATED A LITTLE AND WAS MUCH REFRESHED THE APPREHENSIONS OF ITS BEING THE INFECTION WENT ALSO QUITE AWAY WITH MY ILLNESS AND I WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS AS USUAL
26-496-0000 IT WAS NOW MID JULY AND THE PLAGUE WHICH HAD CHIEFLY RAGED AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN AND AS I SAID BEFORE IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN
26-496-0001 FOR THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY WITHIN THE WALLS WAS INDIFFERENTLY HEALTHY STILL NOR WAS IT GOT THEN VERY MUCH OVER THE WATER INTO SOUTHWARK
26-496-0002 OF ALL DISTEMPERS WHEREOF IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DIED OF THE PLAGUE YET THERE WAS BUT TWENTY EIGHT IN THE WHOLE CITY WITHIN THE WALLS AND BUT NINETEEN IN SOUTHWARK
26-496-0003 BUT WE PERCEIVED THE INFECTION KEPT CHIEFLY IN THE OUT PARISHES WHICH BEING VERY POPULOUS AND FULLER ALSO OF POOR THE DISTEMPER FOUND MORE TO PREY UPON THAN IN THE CITY
26-496-0004 YET THERE DIED NO MORE OF THE PLAGUE ON THE WHOLE SOUTHWARK SIDE OF THE WATER THAN SIXTEEN BUT THIS FACE OF THINGS SOON CHANGED
26-496-0005 AND IT BEGAN TO THICKEN IN CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ESPECIALLY AND IN CLARKENWELL SO THAT BY THE SECOND WEEK IN AUGUST CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ALONE BURIED EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND CLARKENWELL
26-496-0006 AND OF THE LAST THE BILL ITSELF SAID
26-496-0007 AND HAVING THE KEY IN MY POCKET I USED TO GO INTO THE HOUSE AND OVER MOST OF THE ROOMS TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL FOR THOUGH IT BE SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO TELL
26-496-0008 THAT ANY SHOULD HAVE HEARTS SO HARDENED IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A CALAMITY AS TO ROB AND STEAL YET CERTAIN IT IS THAT ALL SORTS OF VILLAINIES AND EVEN LEVITIES AND DEBAUCHERIES
26-496-0009 WERE THEN PRACTISED IN THE TOWN AS OPENLY AS EVER I WILL NOT SAY QUITE AS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE MANY WAYS LESSENED BUT THE CITY ITSELF BEGAN NOW TO BE VISITED TOO
26-496-0010 MAGISTRATES AND SERVANTS LEFT IN THE CITY AS THEY FLED NOW OUT OF THE CITY SO I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT THE COURT REMOVED EARLY
26-496-0011 IN THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WENT TO OXFORD WHERE IT PLEASED GOD TO PRESERVE THEM AND THE DISTEMPER DID NOT AS I HEARD OF SO MUCH AS TOUCH THEM FOR WHICH I CANNOT SAY THAT
26-496-0012 AND HARDLY ANYTHING OF REFORMATION THOUGH THEY DID NOT WANT BEING TOLD THAT THEIR CRYING VICES MIGHT WITHOUT BREACH OF CHARITY BE SAID TO HAVE GONE FAR IN BRINGING THAT TERRIBLE JUDGEMENT UPON THE WHOLE NATION
26-496-0013 THAT IF I HAD BEEN A STRANGER AND AT A LOSS FOR MY WAY I MIGHT SOMETIMES HAVE GONE THE LENGTH OF A WHOLE STREET I MEAN OF THE BY STREETS AND SEEN NOBODY TO DIRECT ME
26-496-0014 BUT THEY WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT STREET NEITHER ON ONE SIDE
26-496-0015 BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
26-496-0016 AS OTHERS RETIRED REALLY FRIGHTED WITH THE DISTEMPER IT WAS A MERE DESOLATING OF SOME OF THE STREETS BUT THE FRIGHT WAS NOT YET NEAR SO GREAT IN THE CITY ABSTRACTLY SO CALLED
26-496-0017 AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THOUGH THEY WERE AT FIRST IN A MOST INEXPRESSIBLE CONSTERNATION YET AS I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE DISTEMPER INTERMITTED OFTEN AT FIRST SO THEY WERE AS IT WERE
26-496-0018 A LITTLE HARDENED IT IS TRUE A VAST MANY PEOPLE FLED AS I HAVE OBSERVED YET THEY WERE CHIEFLY FROM THE WEST END OF THE TOWN AND FROM THAT WE CALL THE HEART OF THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY
26-496-0019 AMONG THE WEALTHIEST OF THE PEOPLE AND SUCH PEOPLE AS WERE UNENCUMBERED WITH TRADES AND BUSINESS BUT OF THE REST THE GENERALITY STAYED AND SEEMED TO ABIDE THE WORST SO THAT
26-496-0020 AND IN THE SUBURBS IN SOUTHWARK AND IN THE EAST PART SUCH AS WAPPING RATCLIFF STEPNEY ROTHERHITHE AND THE LIKE THE PEOPLE GENERALLY STAYED EXCEPT HERE AND THERE A FEW WEALTHY FAMILIES WHO AS ABOVE
26-496-0021 AND THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THE MONARCHY BEING RESTORED HAD FLOCKED TO LONDON TO SETTLE IN BUSINESS OR TO DEPEND UPON AND ATTEND THE COURT FOR REWARDS OF SERVICES PREFERMENTS AND THE LIKE
26-496-0022 WAS SUCH THAT THE TOWN WAS COMPUTED TO HAVE IN IT ABOVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE THAN EVER IT HELD BEFORE NAY SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO SAY IT HAD TWICE AS MANY BECAUSE
26-496-0023 ALL THE RUINED FAMILIES OF THE ROYAL PARTY FLOCKED HITHER ALL THE OLD SOLDIERS SET UP TRADES HERE AND ABUNDANCE OF FAMILIES SETTLED HERE AGAIN
26-496-0024 TO LONDON I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT AS JERUSALEM WAS BESIEGED BY THE ROMANS WHEN THE JEWS WERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE PASSOVER BY WHICH MEANS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED THERE
26-496-0025 AS THIS CONFLUX OF THE PEOPLE TO A YOUTHFUL AND GAY COURT MADE A GREAT TRADE IN THE CITY ESPECIALLY IN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO FASHION AND FINERY
26-496-0026 MANUFACTURERS AND THE LIKE
27-123349-0001 BUT HE WAS PLACED UNDER THE CONTROL OF A COMMITTEE
27-123349-0002 WHERE THE EXPEDITION SHOULD LAND TO APPOINT OFFICERS TO SUPERINTEND THE LEVYING OF TROOPS TO DOLE OUT PROVISIONS AND AMMUNITION ALL THAT WAS LEFT TO THE GENERAL WAS TO DIRECT THE EVOLUTIONS OF THE ARMY IN THE FIELD
27-123349-0003 AND HE WAS FORCED TO PROMISE THAT EVEN IN THE FIELD EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A SURPRISE HE WOULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT THE ASSENT OF A COUNCIL OF WAR MONMOUTH WAS TO COMMAND IN ENGLAND HIS SOFT MIND HAD AS USUAL
27-123349-0004 TAKEN AN IMPRESS FROM THE SOCIETY WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AMBITIOUS HOPES WHICH HAD SEEMED TO BE EXTINGUISHED REVIVED IN HIS BOSOM HE REMEMBERED THE AFFECTION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY GREETED BY THE COMMON PEOPLE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY
27-123349-0005 AND EXPECTED THAT THEY WOULD NOW RISE BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS TO WELCOME HIM HE REMEMBERED THE GOOD WILL WHICH THE SOLDIERS HAD ALWAYS BORNE HIM AND FLATTERED HIMSELF THAT THEY WOULD COME OVER TO HIM BY REGIMENTS
27-123349-0006 ENCOURAGING MESSAGES REACHED HIM IN QUICK SUCCESSION FROM LONDON HE WAS ASSURED THAT THE VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH THE ELECTIONS HAD BEEN CARRIED ON HAD DRIVEN THE NATION MAD
27-123349-0007 THAT THE PRUDENCE OF THE LEADING WHIGS HAD WITH DIFFICULTY PREVENTED A SANGUINARY OUTBREAK ON THE DAY OF THE CORONATION AND THAT ALL THE GREAT LORDS WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE EXCLUSION BILL WERE IMPATIENT TO RALLY ROUND HIM
27-123349-0008 WILDMAN WHO LOVED TO TALK TREASON IN PARABLES SENT TO SAY THAT THE EARL OF RICHMOND JUST TWO HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE HAD LANDED IN ENGLAND WITH A HANDFUL OF MEN AND HAD A FEW DAYS LATER BEEN CROWNED ON THE FIELD OF BOSWORTH
27-123349-0009 ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED OF HIM WAS TO PROMISE THAT HE WOULD NOT ASSUME THE REGAL TITLE
27-123349-0010 IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TWO ENGLISHMEN
27-123349-0011 SHOULD ACCOMPANY ARGYLE TO SCOTLAND AND THAT FLETCHER SHOULD GO WITH MONMOUTH TO ENGLAND FLETCHER FROM THE BEGINNING HAD AUGURED ILL OF THE ENTERPRISE BUT HIS CHIVALROUS SPIRIT WOULD NOT SUFFER HIM TO DECLINE A RISK WHICH HIS FRIENDS SEEMED EAGER TO ENCOUNTER
27-123349-0012 WHEN GREY REPEATED WITH APPROBATION WHAT WILDMAN HAD SAID ABOUT RICHMOND AND RICHARD THE WELL READ AND THOUGHTFUL SCOT JUSTLY REMARKED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SEVENTEENTH
27-123349-0013 RICHMOND WAS ASSURED OF THE SUPPORT OF BARONS EACH OF WHOM COULD BRING AN ARMY OF FEUDAL RETAINERS INTO THE FIELD
27-123349-0014 A SUM SUFFICIENT FOR THE TWO EXPEDITIONS VERY LITTLE WAS OBTAINED FROM LONDON SIX THOUSAND POUNDS HAD BEEN EXPECTED THENCE BUT INSTEAD OF THE MONEY CAME EXCUSES FROM WILDMAN
27-123349-0015 BUT HIS INTELLECT AND HIS TEMPER PRESERVED HIM FROM THE VIOLENCE OF A PARTISAN HE HAD LIVED ON CONFIDENTIAL TERMS WITH SHAFTESBURY AND HAD THUS INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF THE COURT LOCKE'S PRUDENCE HAD HOWEVER
27-123349-0016 BEEN SUCH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO LITTLE PURPOSE TO BRING HIM EVEN BEFORE THE CORRUPT AND PARTIAL TRIBUNALS OF THAT AGE IN ONE POINT HOWEVER HE WAS VULNERABLE HE WAS A STUDENT OF CHRIST CHURCH IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD
27-123349-0017 BUT THIS WAS NOT EASY LOCKE HAD AT OXFORD ABSTAINED FROM EXPRESSING ANY OPINION ON THE POLITICS OF THE DAY SPIES HAD BEEN SET ABOUT HIM DOCTORS OF DIVINITY AND MASTERS OF ARTS
27-123349-0018 TO THE EXCLUSION BILL AND TO THE CHARACTER OF THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY BUT IN VAIN LOCKE NEITHER BROKE OUT NOR DISSEMBLED BUT MAINTAINED SUCH STEADY SILENCE AND COMPOSURE AS FORCED THE TOOLS OF POWER TO OWN WITH VEXATION
27-123349-0019 THAT NEVER MAN WAS SO COMPLETE A MASTER OF HIS TONGUE AND OF HIS PASSIONS WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT TREACHERY COULD DO NOTHING ARBITRARY POWER WAS USED AFTER VAINLY TRYING TO INVEIGLE LOCKE INTO A FAULT
27-123349-0020 THE GOVERNMENT RESOLVED TO PUNISH HIM WITHOUT ONE ORDERS CAME FROM WHITEHALL THAT HE SHOULD BE EJECTED AND THOSE ORDERS THE DEAN AND CANONS MADE HASTE TO OBEY
27-123349-0021 LOCKE WAS TRAVELLING ON THE CONTINENT FOR HIS HEALTH WHEN HE LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF HIS HOME AND OF HIS BREAD WITHOUT A TRIAL OR EVEN A NOTICE
27-123349-0022 THE INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED WOULD HAVE EXCUSED HIM IF HE HAD RESORTED TO VIOLENT METHODS OF REDRESS BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE BLINDED BY PERSONAL RESENTMENT HE AUGURED NO GOOD FROM THE SCHEMES
27-123349-0023 BUT IT WAS APPREHENDED THAT ARGYLE WOULD SHORTLY APPEAR IN ARMS AMONG HIS CLANSMEN A PROCLAMATION WAS ACCORDINGLY ISSUED DIRECTING THAT SCOTLAND SHOULD BE PUT INTO A STATE OF DEFENCE THE MILITIA WAS ORDERED TO BE IN READINESS
27-123349-0024 ALL THE CLANS HOSTILE TO THE NAME OF CAMPBELL WERE SET IN MOTION JOHN MURRAY MARQUESS OF ATHOL
27-123349-0025 AND AT THE HEAD OF A GREAT BODY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
27-123349-0026 WHO HAD LONG RESIDED IN ENGLAND AS AMBASSADOR FROM THE UNITED PROVINCES AND EVERARD VAN DYKVELT WHO AFTER THE DEATH OF CHARLES HAD BEEN SENT BY THE STATE GENERAL ON A SPECIAL MISSION OF CONDOLENCE AND CONGRATULATION
27-123349-0027 THE KING SAID THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM UNQUESTIONABLE SOURCES INTELLIGENCE OF DESIGNS WHICH WERE FORMING AGAINST THE THRONE BY HIS BANISHED SUBJECTS IN HOLLAND SOME OF THE EXILES WERE CUTTHROATS
27-123349-0028 WHOM NOTHING BUT THE SPECIAL PROVIDENCE OF GOD HAD PREVENTED FROM COMMITTING A FOUL MURDER AND AMONG THEM WAS THE OWNER OF THE SPOT WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED FOR THE BUTCHERY
27-123349-0029 ARGYLE HAS THE GREATEST MEANS OF ANNOYING ME AND OF ALL PLACES HOLLAND IS THAT WHENCE A BLOW MAY BE BEST AIMED AGAINST ME THE DUTCH ENVOYS ASSURED HIS MAJESTY THAT WHAT HE HAD SAID SHOULD INSTANTLY BE COMMUNICATED TO THE GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0030 WERE AT THIS TIME MOST DESIROUS THAT THE HOSPITALITY OF THEIR COUNTRY
27-123349-0031 JAMES HAD LATELY HELD LANGUAGE WHICH ENCOURAGED THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD NOT PATIENTLY SUBMIT TO THE ASCENDANCY OF FRANCE IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD CONSENT TO FORM A CLOSE ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES AND THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
27-123349-0032 THERE WAS THEREFORE AT THE HAGUE AN EXTREME ANXIETY TO AVOID ALL THAT COULD GIVE HIM OFFENCE THE PERSONAL INTEREST OF WILLIAM WAS ALSO ON THIS OCCASION IDENTICAL WITH THE INTEREST OF HIS FATHER IN LAW
27-123349-0033 BUT THE CASE WAS ONE WHICH REQUIRED RAPID AND VIGOROUS ACTION AND THE NATURE OF THE BATAVIAN INSTITUTIONS MADE SUCH ACTION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THE UNION OF UTRECHT
27-123349-0034 FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING IMMEDIATE EXIGENCIES HAD NEVER BEEN DELIBERATELY REVISED AND PERFECTED IN A TIME OF TRANQUILLITY EVERY ONE OF THE SEVEN COMMONWEALTHS
27-123349-0035 WHICH THAT UNION HAD BOUND TOGETHER RETAINED ALMOST ALL THE RIGHTS OF SOVEREIGNTY AND ASSERTED THOSE RIGHTS PUNCTILIOUSLY AGAINST THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0036 AS THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT THE MEANS OF EXACTING PROMPT OBEDIENCE FROM THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES SO THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT THE MEANS OF EXACTING PROMPT OBEDIENCE FROM THE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES
27-123349-0037 HOLLAND ALONE CONTAINED EIGHTEEN CITIES EACH OF WHICH WAS FOR MANY PURPOSES AN INDEPENDENT STATE JEALOUS OF ALL INTERFERENCE FROM WITHOUT IF THE RULERS OF SUCH A CITY RECEIVED FROM THE HAGUE AN ORDER
27-123349-0038 WHICH WAS UNPLEASING TO THEM THEY EITHER NEGLECTED IT ALTOGETHER OR EXECUTED IT LANGUIDLY AND TARDILY IN SOME TOWN COUNCILS INDEED THE INFLUENCE OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE WAS ALL POWERFUL
27-123349-0039 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PLACE WHERE THE BRITISH EXILES HAD CONGREGATED AND WHERE THEIR SHIPS HAD BEEN FITTED OUT WAS THE RICH AND POPULOUS AMSTERDAM AND THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM WERE THE HEADS OF THE FACTION HOSTILE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0040 AND TO THE HOUSE OF NASSAU THE NAVAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED PROVINCES WAS CONDUCTED BY FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY ONE OF THOSE BOARDS SATE AT AMSTERDAM WAS PARTLY NOMINATED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THAT CITY
27-123349-0041 AND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ANIMATED BY THEIR SPIRIT ALL THE ENDEAVOURS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO EFFECT WHAT JAMES DESIRED WERE FRUSTRATED BY THE EVASIONS OF THE FUNCTIONARIES OF AMSTERDAM AND BY THE BLUNDERS OF COLONEL BEVIL SKELTON
27-123349-0042 THEN INSTEAD OF APPLYING AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE TO THE STATES GENERAL WHO SATE CLOSE TO HIS OWN DOOR
27-123349-0043 WITH A REQUEST THAT THE SUSPECTED SHIPS MIGHT BE DETAINED THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM ANSWERED THAT THE ENTRANCE OF THE ZUYDER ZEE WAS OUT OF THEIR JURISDICTION AND REFERRED HIM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THIS WAS A MERE EXCUSE
27-123349-0044 AND THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY REAL WISH AT THE STADTHOUSE OF AMSTERDAM TO PREVENT ARGYLE FROM SAILING NO DIFFICULTIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE SKELTON NOW ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE STATES GENERAL THEY SHOWED EVERY DISPOSITION TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMAND
27-123349-0045 DEPARTED FROM THE COURSE WHICH THEY ORDINARILY OBSERVED IN THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH HE MADE HIS APPLICATION TO THEM AN ORDER DRAWN IN EXACT CONFORMITY WITH HIS REQUEST
27-123349-0046 WAS DESPATCHED TO THE ADMIRALTY OF AMSTERDAM BUT THIS ORDER IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME MISINFORMATION DID NOT CORRECTLY DESCRIBE THE SITUATION OF THE SHIPS THEY WERE SAID TO BE IN THE TEXEL
27-123349-0047 WOULD IN A MOMENT HAVE PUT AN END TO HIS EXPEDITION ROUND HIS LITTLE FLEET A BOAT WAS ROWING IN WHICH WERE SOME PERSONS WITH TELESCOPES WHOM HE SUSPECTED TO BE SPIES BUT NO EFFECTUAL STEP WAS TAKEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETAINING HIM
27-123349-0048 AND ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE SECOND OF MAY HE STOOD OUT TO SEA BEFORE A FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VOYAGE WAS PROSPEROUS ON THE SIXTH THE ORKNEYS WERE IN SIGHT ARGYLE VERY UNWISELY ANCHORED OFF KIRKWALL
27-123349-0049 AND ALLOWED TWO OF HIS FOLLOWERS TO GO ON SHORE THERE THE BISHOP ORDERED THEM TO BE ARRESTED THE REFUGEES PROCEEDED TO HOLD A LONG AND ANIMATED DEBATE ON THIS MISADVENTURE
27-123349-0050 FOR FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THEIR EXPEDITION HOWEVER LANGUID AND IRRESOLUTE THEIR CONDUCT MIGHT BE THEY NEVER IN DEBATE WANTED SPIRIT OR PERSEVERANCE SOME WERE FOR AN ATTACK ON KIRKWALL
27-123349-0051 SOME WERE FOR PROCEEDING WITHOUT DELAY TO ARGYLESHIRE AT LAST THE EARL SEIZED SOME GENTLEMEN WHO LIVED NEAR THE COAST OF THE ISLAND AND PROPOSED TO THE BISHOP AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS THE BISHOP RETURNED NO ANSWER AND THE FLEET
27-123349-0052 AFTER LOSING THREE DAYS SAILED AWAY THIS DELAY WAS FULL OF DANGER IT WAS SPEEDILY KNOWN AT EDINBURGH THAT THE REBEL SQUADRON HAD TOUCHED AT THE ORKNEYS TROOPS WERE INSTANTLY PUT IN MOTION
27-123349-0053 WHEN THE EARL REACHED HIS OWN PROVINCE HE FOUND THAT PREPARATIONS HAD BEEN MADE TO REPEL HIM AT DUNSTAFFNAGE HE SENT HIS SECOND SON CHARLES ON SHORE TO CALL THE CAMPBELLS TO ARMS BUT CHARLES RETURNED WITH GLOOMY TIDINGS
27-123349-0054 THE HERDSMEN AND FISHERMEN WERE INDEED READY TO RALLY ROUND MAC CALLUM MORE BUT OF THE HEADS OF THE CLAN SOME WERE IN CONFINEMENT AND OTHERS HAD FLED THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO REMAINED AT THEIR HOMES WERE EITHER WELL AFFECTED TO THE GOVERNMENT
