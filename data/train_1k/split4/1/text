1624-142933-0000 PETER SEES ROSEBREAST AND FINDS REDCOAT
1624-142933-0001 WHO'S THAT PETER RABBIT PRICKED UP HIS LONG EARS AND STARED UP AT THE TOPS OF THE TREES OF THE OLD ORCHARD INSTANTLY JENNY WREN POPPED HER HEAD OUT OF HER DOORWAY SHE COCKED HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE TO LISTEN
1624-142933-0002 THEN LOOKED DOWN AT PETER AND HER SHARP LITTLE EYES SNAPPED I DON'T HEAR ANY STRANGE VOICE SAID SHE THE WAY YOU ARE STARING PETER RABBIT ONE WOULD THINK THAT YOU HAD REALLY HEARD SOMETHING NEW AND WORTH WHILE
1624-142933-0003 JUST THEN THERE WERE TWO OR THREE RATHER SHARP SQUEAKY NOTES FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TREES THERE CRIED PETER THERE DIDN'T YOU HEAR THAT JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0004 FOR GOODNESS SAKE PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU DON'T KNOW WHOSE VOICE THAT IS SHE CRIED THAT'S ROSEBREAST HE AND MISSUS ROSEBREAST HAVE BEEN HERE FOR QUITE A LITTLE WHILE
1624-142933-0005 I DIDN'T SUPPOSE THERE WAS ANY ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW THOSE SHARP SQUEAKY VOICES THEY RATHER GET ON MY NERVES WHAT ANYBODY WANTS TO SQUEAK LIKE THAT FOR WHEN THEY CAN SING AS ROSEBREAST CAN IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
1624-142933-0006 AT THAT VERY INSTANT MISTER WREN BEGAN TO SCOLD AS ONLY HE AND JENNY CAN PETER LOOKED UP AT JENNY AND WINKED SLYLY AND WHAT ANYBODY WANTS TO SCOLD LIKE THAT FOR WHEN THEY CAN SING AS MISTER WREN CAN IS TOO MUCH FOR ME
1624-142933-0007 RETORTED PETER BUT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHO ROSEBREAST IS THE GROSBEAK OF COURSE STUPID SPUTTERED JENNY IF YOU DON'T KNOW ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK PETER RABBIT YOU CERTAINLY MUST HAVE BEEN BLIND AND DEAF EVER SINCE YOU WERE BORN
1624-142933-0008 LISTEN TO THAT JUST LISTEN TO THAT SONG PETER LISTENED THERE WERE MANY SONGS FOR IT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MORNING AND ALL THE SINGERS OF THE OLD ORCHARD WERE POURING OUT THE JOY THAT WAS WITHIN THEM
1624-142933-0009 ONE SONG WAS A LITTLE LOUDER AND CLEARER THAN THE OTHERS BECAUSE IT CAME FROM A TREE VERY CLOSE AT HAND THE VERY TREE FROM WHICH THOSE SQUEAKY NOTES HAD COME JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE PETER SUSPECTED THAT THAT MUST BE THE SONG JENNY WREN MEANT HE LOOKED PUZZLED
1624-142933-0010 HE WAS PUZZLED DO YOU MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG HE ASKED RATHER SHEEPISHLY FOR HE HAD A FEELING THAT HE WOULD BE THE VICTIM OF JENNY WREN'S SHARP TONGUE NO I DON'T MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG SNAPPED JENNY
1624-142933-0011 WHAT GOOD ARE A PAIR OF LONG EARS IF THEY CAN'T TELL ONE SONG FROM ANOTHER THAT SONG MAY SOUND SOMETHING LIKE WELCOME ROBIN'S BUT IF YOUR EARS WERE GOOD FOR ANYTHING AT ALL YOU'D KNOW RIGHT AWAY THAT THAT ISN'T WELCOME ROBIN SINGING
1624-142933-0012 THAT'S A BETTER SONG THAN WELCOME ROBIN'S WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG IS ONE OF GOOD CHEER BUT THIS ONE IS OF PURE HAPPINESS I WOULDN'T HAVE A PAIR OF EARS LIKE YOURS FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0013 PETER LAUGHED RIGHT OUT AS HE TRIED TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF JENNY WREN WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE HIS WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT DEMANDED JENNY CROSSLY DON'T YOU DARE LAUGH AT ME
1624-142933-0014 IF THERE IS ANY ONE THING I CAN'T STAND IT IS BEING LAUGHED AT I WASN'T LAUGHING AT YOU REPLIED PETER VERY MEEKLY I WAS JUST LAUGHING AT THE THOUGHT OF HOW FUNNY YOU WOULD LOOK WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE MINE
1624-142933-0015 NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT JENNY THAT SONG IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WELCOME ROBIN'S OF COURSE IT IS RETORTED JENNY THAT IS ROSEBREAST SINGING UP THERE AND THERE HE IS RIGHT IN THE TOP OF THAT TREE
1624-142933-0016 ISN'T HE HANDSOME PETER LOOKED UP TO SEE A BIRD A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS HEAD THROAT AND BACK WERE BLACK HIS WINGS WERE BLACK WITH PATCHES OF WHITE ON THEM
1624-142933-0017 BUT IT WAS HIS BREAST THAT MADE PETER CATCH HIS BREATH WITH A LITTLE GASP OF ADMIRATION FOR THAT BREAST WAS A BEAUTIFUL ROSE RED THE REST OF HIM UNDERNEATH WAS WHITE IT WAS ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK ISN'T HE LOVELY
1624-142933-0018 CRIED PETER AND ADDED IN THE NEXT BREATH WHO IS THAT WITH HIM MISSUS GROSBEAK OF COURSE WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE SPUTTERED JENNY RATHER CROSSLY FOR SHE WAS STILL A LITTLE PUT OUT BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN LAUGHED AT
1624-142933-0019 SAID PETER SHE DOESN'T LOOK THE LEAST BIT LIKE HIM THIS WAS QUITE TRUE THERE WAS NO BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR ABOUT MISSUS GROSBEAK SHE WAS DRESSED CHIEFLY IN BROWN AND GRAYISH COLORS WITH A LITTLE BUFF HERE AND THERE AND WITH DARK STREAKS ON HER BREAST
1624-142933-0020 OVER EACH EYE WAS A WHITISH LINE ALTOGETHER SHE LOOKED MORE AS IF SHE MIGHT BE A BIG MEMBER OF THE SPARROW FAMILY THAN THE WIFE OF HANDSOME ROSEBREAST
1624-142933-0021 WHILE ROSEBREAST SANG MISSUS GROSBEAK WAS VERY BUSILY PICKING BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FROM THE TREE WHAT IS SHE DOING THAT FOR INQUIRED PETER FOR THE SAME REASON THAT YOU BITE OFF SWEET CLOVER BLOSSOMS AND LEAVES
1624-142933-0022 REPLIED JENNY WREN TARTLY DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS CRIED PETER I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT YOU CAN ASK MORE SILLY QUESTIONS THAN ANYBODY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE RETORTED JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0023 OF COURSE THEY DON'T LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS IF THEY DID THEY WOULD SOON STARVE TO DEATH FOR BUDS AND BLOSSOMS DON'T LAST LONG THEY EAT A FEW JUST FOR VARIETY BUT THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON BUGS AND INSECTS
1624-142933-0024 YOU ASK FARMER BROWN'S BOY WHO HELPS HIM MOST IN HIS POTATO PATCH AND HE'LL TELL YOU IT'S THE GROSBEAKS THEY CERTAINLY DO LOVE POTATO BUGS THEY EAT SOME FRUIT BUT ON THE WHOLE THEY ARE ABOUT AS USEFUL AROUND A GARDEN AS ANY ONE I KNOW
1624-142933-0025 NOW RUN ALONG PETER RABBIT AND DON'T BOTHER ME ANY MORE SEEING FARMER BROWN'S BOY COMING THROUGH THE OLD ORCHARD PETER DECIDED THAT IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HIM TO DEPART SO HE SCAMPERED FOR THE GREEN FOREST LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP
1624-142933-0026 JUST WITHIN THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOMETHING WHICH FOR THE TIME BEING PUT ALL THOUGHT OF FARMER BROWN'S BOY OUT OF HIS HEAD FLUTTERING ON THE GROUND WAS A BIRD THAN WHOM NOT EVEN GLORY THE CARDINAL WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL
1624-142933-0027 IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF REDWING THE BLACKBIRD WINGS AND TAIL WERE PURE BLACK AND ALL THE REST WAS A BEAUTIFUL SCARLET IT WAS REDCOAT THE TANAGER AT FIRST PETER HAD EYES ONLY FOR THE WONDERFUL BEAUTY OF REDCOAT
1624-142933-0028 NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SEEN REDCOAT SO CLOSE AT HAND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER PETER THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH REDCOAT AND HE HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THE TROUBLE MIGHT BE REDCOAT HEARD THE RUSTLE OF PETER'S FEET AMONG THE DRY LEAVES
1624-142933-0029 BUT HE COULD NOT GET OFF THE GROUND WHAT IS IT REDCOAT HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU IT IS JUST PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM ME CRIED PETER THE LOOK OF TERROR WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE EYES OF REDCOAT DIED OUT
1624-142933-0030 AND HE STOPPED FLUTTERING AND SIMPLY LAY PANTING OH PETER HE GASPED YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GLAD I AM THAT IT IS ONLY YOU I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM TO DO
1624-142933-0031 I CAN'T FLY AND IF I HAVE TO STAY ON THE GROUND SOME ENEMY WILL BE SURE TO GET ME WHAT SHALL I DO PETER WHAT SHALL I DO RIGHT AWAY PETER WAS FULL OF SYMPATHY
1624-142933-0032 WHAT KIND OF AN ACCIDENT WAS IT REDCOAT AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN HE ASKED BROADWING THE HAWK TRIED TO CATCH ME
1624-142933-0033 AND DID NOT SEE JUST WHERE I WAS GOING I STRUCK A SHARP POINTED DEAD TWIG AND DROVE IT RIGHT THROUGH MY RIGHT WING REDCOAT HELD UP HIS RIGHT WING AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A LITTLE STICK PROJECTING FROM BOTH SIDES CLOSE UP TO THE SHOULDER
1624-142933-0034 THE WING WAS BLEEDING A LITTLE OH DEAR WHATEVER SHALL I DO PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0035 SOBBED REDCOAT DOES IT PAIN YOU DREADFULLY ASKED PETER REDCOAT NODDED BUT I DON'T MIND THE PAIN HE HASTENED TO SAY IT IS THE THOUGHT OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO ME
1624-142933-0036 POOR REDCOAT WITH THE OLD LOOK OF TERROR IN HIS EYES FLUTTERED ALONG TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING UNDER WHICH TO HIDE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING UNDER WHICH HE COULD CRAWL AND THERE WAS NO HIDING THAT WONDERFUL RED COAT
1624-142933-0037 PETER HEARD THE SOUND OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS AND LOOKING BACK SAW THAT FARMER BROWN'S BOY WAS COMING DON'T BE AFRAID REDCOAT HE WHISPERED IT'S FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND I'M SURE HE WON'T HURT YOU PERHAPS HE CAN HELP YOU
1624-142933-0038 THEN PETER SCAMPERED OFF FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND SAT UP TO WATCH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
1624-142933-0039 NO ONE WITH ANY EYES AT ALL COULD HAVE HELPED SEEING HIM BECAUSE OF THAT WONDERFUL SCARLET COAT HE SAW TOO BY THE WAY REDCOAT WAS ACTING THAT HE WAS IN GREAT TROUBLE AS FARMER BROWN'S BOY DREW NEAR AND REDCOAT SAW THAT HE WAS DISCOVERED
1624-142933-0040 HE TRIED HIS HARDEST TO FLUTTER AWAY FARMER BROWN'S BOY UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ONE WING AND RUNNING FORWARD HE CAUGHT REDCOAT YOU POOR LITTLE THING
1624-142933-0041 SAID FARMER BROWN'S BOY SOFTLY AS HE SAW THE CRUEL TWIG STICKING THROUGH REDCOATS SHOULDER
1624-142933-0042 CONTINUED FARMER BROWN'S BOY STROKING REDCOAT EVER SO GENTLY SOMEHOW AT THAT GENTLE TOUCH REDCOAT LOST MUCH OF HIS FEAR AND A LITTLE HOPE SPRANG IN HIS HEART
1624-142933-0043 FARMER BROWN'S BOY TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND CAREFULLY CUT OFF THE TWIG ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE WING THEN DOING HIS BEST TO BE CAREFUL AND TO HURT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE HE WORKED THE OTHER PART OF THE TWIG OUT FROM THE UNDER SIDE
1624-142933-0044 CAREFULLY HE EXAMINED THE WING TO SEE IF ANY BONES WERE BROKEN NONE WERE AND AFTER HOLDING REDCOAT A FEW MINUTES HE CAREFULLY SET HIM UP IN A TREE AND WITHDREW A SHORT DISTANCE REDCOAT HOPPED FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH
1624-142933-0045 UNTIL HE WAS HALFWAY UP THE TREE THEN HE SAT THERE FOR SOME TIME AS IF FEARFUL OF TRYING THAT INJURED WING MEANWHILE MISSUS TANAGER CAME AND FUSSED ABOUT HIM AND TALKED TO HIM AND COAXED HIM AND MADE AS MUCH OF HIM AS IF HE WERE A BABY
1624-142933-0046 FROM TREE TO TREE HE FLEW
1624-168623-0000 THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED FOR MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF THIS COUPLE AND CONSIDERING IT UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS THENARDIER HAD JUST PASSED HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY MADAME THENARDIER WAS APPROACHING HER FORTIES WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO FIFTY IN A WOMAN
1624-168623-0001 SO THAT THERE EXISTED A BALANCE OF AGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE OUR READERS HAVE POSSIBLY PRESERVED SOME RECOLLECTION OF THIS THENARDIER WOMAN EVER SINCE HER FIRST APPEARANCE TALL BLOND RED FAT ANGULAR SQUARE
1624-168623-0002 ENORMOUS AND AGILE SHE BELONGED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE RACE OF THOSE COLOSSAL WILD WOMEN WHO CONTORT THEMSELVES AT FAIRS WITH PAVING STONES HANGING FROM THEIR HAIR SHE DID EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HOUSE
1624-168623-0003 MADE THE BEDS DID THE WASHING THE COOKING AND EVERYTHING ELSE COSETTE WAS HER ONLY SERVANT A MOUSE IN THE SERVICE OF AN ELEPHANT EVERYTHING TREMBLED AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE WINDOW PANES FURNITURE AND PEOPLE
1624-168623-0004 HER BIG FACE DOTTED WITH RED BLOTCHES PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF A SKIMMER SHE HAD A BEARD SHE WAS AN IDEAL MARKET PORTER DRESSED IN WOMAN'S CLOTHES SHE SWORE SPLENDIDLY
1624-168623-0005 SHE BOASTED OF BEING ABLE TO CRACK A NUT WITH ONE BLOW OF HER FIST EXCEPT FOR THE ROMANCES WHICH SHE HAD READ AND WHICH MADE THE AFFECTED LADY PEEP THROUGH THE OGRESS AT TIMES IN A VERY QUEER WAY THE IDEA WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE TO SAY OF HER
1624-168623-0006 THAT IS A WOMAN THIS THENARDIER FEMALE WAS LIKE THE PRODUCT OF A WENCH ENGRAFTED ON A FISHWIFE WHEN ONE HEARD HER SPEAK ONE SAID THAT IS A GENDARME WHEN ONE SAW HER DRINK ONE SAID THAT IS A CARTER
1624-168623-0007 WHEN ONE SAW HER HANDLE COSETTE ONE SAID THAT IS THE HANGMAN ONE OF HER TEETH PROJECTED WHEN HER FACE WAS IN REPOSE THENARDIER WAS A SMALL THIN PALE ANGULAR BONY FEEBLE MAN
1624-168623-0008 HIS CUNNING BEGAN HERE HE SMILED HABITUALLY BY WAY OF PRECAUTION AND WAS ALMOST POLITE TO EVERYBODY EVEN TO THE BEGGAR TO WHOM HE REFUSED HALF A FARTHING HE HAD THE GLANCE OF A POLE CAT AND THE BEARING OF A MAN OF LETTERS
1624-168623-0009 HE GREATLY RESEMBLED THE PORTRAITS OF THE ABBE DELILLE HIS COQUETRY CONSISTED IN DRINKING WITH THE CARTERS NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN RENDERING HIM DRUNK HE SMOKED A BIG PIPE
1624-168623-0010 HE WORE A BLOUSE AND UNDER HIS BLOUSE AN OLD BLACK COAT HE MADE PRETENSIONS TO LITERATURE AND TO MATERIALISM THERE WERE CERTAIN NAMES WHICH HE OFTEN PRONOUNCED TO SUPPORT WHATEVER THINGS HE MIGHT BE SAYING VOLTAIRE
1624-168623-0011 HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD A SYSTEM IN ADDITION HE WAS A GREAT SWINDLER
1624-168623-0012 THE SPECIES DOES EXIST IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HE PRETENDED TO HAVE SERVED IN THE ARMY HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF RELATING WITH EXUBERANCE HOW BEING A SERGEANT IN THE SIXTH OR THE NINTH LIGHT SOMETHING OR OTHER AT WATERLOO
1624-168623-0013 HE HAD ALONE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF A SQUADRON OF DEATH DEALING HUSSARS COVERED WITH HIS BODY AND SAVED FROM DEATH IN THE MIDST OF THE GRAPE SHOT A GENERAL WHO HAD BEEN DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED
1624-168623-0014 THENCE AROSE FOR HIS WALL THE FLARING SIGN AND FOR HIS INN THE NAME WHICH IT BORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CABARET OF THE SERGEANT OF WATERLOO HE WAS A LIBERAL A CLASSIC AND A BONAPARTIST
1624-168623-0015 WE BELIEVE THAT HE HAD SIMPLY STUDIED IN HOLLAND FOR AN INN KEEPER THIS RASCAL OF COMPOSITE ORDER WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME FLEMING FROM LILLE IN FLANDERS A FRENCHMAN IN PARIS A BELGIAN AT BRUSSELS
1624-168623-0016 BEING COMFORTABLY ASTRIDE OF BOTH FRONTIERS AS FOR HIS PROWESS AT WATERLOO THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THAT IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT HE EXAGGERATED IT A TRIFLE EBB AND FLOW
1624-168623-0017 A TATTERED CONSCIENCE ENTAILS A FRAGMENTARY LIFE AND APPARENTLY AT THE STORMY EPOCH OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN THENARDIER BELONGED TO THAT VARIETY OF MARAUDING SUTLERS OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
1624-168623-0018 BEATING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SELLING TO SOME STEALING FROM OTHERS AND TRAVELLING LIKE A FAMILY MAN WITH WIFE AND CHILDREN IN A RICKETY CART IN THE REAR OF TROOPS ON THE MARCH WITH AN INSTINCT FOR ALWAYS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMY
1624-168623-0019 THIS CAMPAIGN ENDED AND HAVING AS HE SAID
1624-168623-0020 OF GOLD RINGS AND SILVER CROSSES GATHERED IN HARVEST TIME IN FURROWS SOWN WITH CORPSES DID NOT AMOUNT TO A LARGE TOTAL AND DID NOT CARRY THIS SUTLER TURNED EATING HOUSE KEEPER VERY FAR
1624-168623-0021 ACCOMPANIED BY AN OATH RECALLS THE BARRACKS AND BY A SIGN OF THE CROSS THE SEMINARY HE WAS A FINE TALKER HE ALLOWED IT TO BE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS AN EDUCATED MAN
1624-168623-0022 BUT PRACTISED EYES SOMETIMES SPIED OUT ORTHOGRAPHICAL ERRORS IN IT THENARDIER WAS CUNNING GREEDY SLOTHFUL AND CLEVER HE DID NOT DISDAIN HIS SERVANTS WHICH CAUSED HIS WIFE TO DISPENSE WITH THEM
1624-168623-0023 THIS GIANTESS WAS JEALOUS IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THAT THIN AND YELLOW LITTLE MAN MUST BE AN OBJECT COVETED BY ALL THENARDIER WHO WAS ABOVE ALL AN ASTUTE AND WELL BALANCED MAN WAS A SCAMP OF A TEMPERATE SORT
1624-168623-0024 THIS IS THE WORST SPECIES HYPOCRISY ENTERS INTO IT IT IS NOT THAT THENARDIER WAS NOT ON OCCASION CAPABLE OF WRATH TO QUITE THE SAME DEGREE AS HIS WIFE BUT THIS WAS VERY RARE
1624-168623-0025 AND AT SUCH TIMES SINCE HE WAS ENRAGED WITH THE HUMAN RACE IN GENERAL AS HE BORE WITHIN HIM A DEEP FURNACE OF HATRED AND SINCE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUALLY AVENGING THEIR WRONGS
1624-168623-0026 WHO ACCUSE EVERYTHING THAT PASSES BEFORE THEM OF EVERYTHING WHICH HAS BEFALLEN THEM AND WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO CAST UPON THE FIRST PERSON WHO COMES TO HAND AS A LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCE THE SUM TOTAL OF THE DECEPTIONS THE BANKRUPTCIES AND THE CALAMITIES OF THEIR LIVES
1624-168623-0027 WHEN ALL THIS LEAVEN WAS STIRRED UP IN HIM AND BOILED FORTH FROM HIS MOUTH AND EYES HE WAS TERRIBLE WOE TO THE PERSON WHO CAME UNDER HIS WRATH AT SUCH A TIME IN ADDITION TO HIS OTHER QUALITIES THENARDIER WAS ATTENTIVE AND PENETRATING
1624-168623-0028 SILENT OR TALKATIVE ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALWAYS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE LOOK OF SAILORS WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SCREW UP THEIR EYES TO GAZE THROUGH MARINE GLASSES THENARDIER WAS A STATESMAN
1624-168623-0029 EVERY NEW COMER WHO ENTERED THE TAVERN SAID ON CATCHING SIGHT OF MADAME THENARDIER THERE IS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE A MISTAKE SHE WAS NOT EVEN THE MISTRESS THE HUSBAND WAS BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS
1624-168623-0030 SHE WORKED HE CREATED HE DIRECTED EVERYTHING BY A SORT OF INVISIBLE AND CONSTANT MAGNETIC ACTION A WORD WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM SOMETIMES A SIGN THE MASTODON OBEYED
1624-168623-0031 THOUGH SHE DID NOT THOROUGHLY REALIZE IT SHE WAS POSSESSED OF VIRTUES AFTER HER OWN KIND IF SHE HAD EVER HAD A DISAGREEMENT AS TO ANY DETAIL WITH
1624-168623-0032 WHICH WAS AN INADMISSIBLE HYPOTHESIS BY THE WAY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BLAMED HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE COMMITTED BEFORE STRANGERS THAT
1624-168623-0033 EXPOSING THE CROWN ALTHOUGH THEIR CONCORD HAD ONLY EVIL AS ITS RESULT
1624-168623-0034 VIEWED ON ITS DWARFED AND GROTESQUE SIDE THIS WAS THAT GRAND AND UNIVERSAL THING THE ADORATION OF MIND BY MATTER FOR CERTAIN UGLY FEATURES HAVE A CAUSE IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF ETERNAL BEAUTY
1624-168623-0035 HENCE THE ABSOLUTE EMPIRE OF THE MAN OVER THAT WOMAN AT CERTAIN MOMENTS SHE BEHELD HIM LIKE A LIGHTED CANDLE AT OTHERS SHE FELT HIM LIKE A CLAW THIS WOMAN WAS A FORMIDABLE CREATURE WHO LOVED NO ONE EXCEPT HER CHILDREN
1624-168623-0036 AND WHO DID NOT FEAR ANY ONE EXCEPT HER HUSBAND SHE WAS A MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS MAMMIFEROUS BUT HER MATERNITY STOPPED SHORT WITH HER DAUGHTERS AND AS WE SHALL SEE DID NOT EXTEND TO BOYS THE MAN HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT HOW TO ENRICH HIMSELF
1624-168623-0037 A THEATRE WORTHY OF THIS GREAT TALENT WAS LACKING
1624-168623-0038 IF RUIN IS POSSIBLE TO ZERO IN SWITZERLAND OR IN THE PYRENEES THIS PENNILESS SCAMP WOULD HAVE BECOME A MILLIONAIRE BUT AN INN KEEPER MUST BROWSE WHERE FATE HAS HITCHED HIM
1624-168623-0039 IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORD INN KEEPER IS HERE EMPLOYED IN A RESTRICTED SENSE AND DOES NOT EXTEND TO AN ENTIRE CLASS IN THIS SAME YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE
1624-168623-0040 THENARDIER WAS BURDENED WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS WORTH OF PETTY DEBTS AND THIS RENDERED HIM ANXIOUS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE OBSTINATE INJUSTICE OF DESTINY IN THIS CASE THENARDIER WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO UNDERSTAND BEST
1624-168623-0041 WITH THE MOST PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES HOSPITALITY BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER
1624-168623-0042 AND QUOTED FOR HIS SKILL IN SHOOTING HE HAD A CERTAIN COLD AND TRANQUIL LAUGH WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS HIS THEORIES AS A LANDLORD SOMETIMES BURST FORTH IN LIGHTNING FLASHES
1624-168623-0043 HE HAD PROFESSIONAL APHORISMS WHICH HE INSERTED INTO HIS WIFE'S MIND THE DUTY OF THE INN KEEPER
1624-168623-0044 AND A SMILE TO STOP PASSERS BY TO EMPTY SMALL PURSES AND TO HONESTLY LIGHTEN HEAVY ONES TO SHELTER TRAVELLING FAMILIES RESPECTFULLY
1624-168623-0045 TO SHAVE THE MAN TO PLUCK THE WOMAN TO PICK THE CHILD CLEAN TO QUOTE THE WINDOW OPEN THE WINDOW SHUT THE CHIMNEY CORNER THE ARM CHAIR THE CHAIR THE OTTOMAN THE STOOL THE FEATHER BED THE MATTRESS AND THE TRUSS OF STRAW
1624-168623-0046 TO KNOW HOW MUCH THE SHADOW USES UP THE MIRROR AND TO PUT A PRICE ON IT AND BY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEVILS TO MAKE THE TRAVELLER PAY FOR EVERYTHING
1624-168623-0047 THIS MAN AND THIS WOMAN WERE RUSE AND RAGE WEDDED A HIDEOUS AND TERRIBLE TEAM WHILE THE HUSBAND PONDERED AND COMBINED MADAME THENARDIER THOUGHT NOT OF ABSENT CREDITORS
1624-168623-0048 TOOK NO HEED OF YESTERDAY NOR OF TO MORROW AND LIVED IN A FIT OF ANGER ALL IN A MINUTE SUCH WERE THESE TWO BEINGS COSETTE WAS BETWEEN THEM SUBJECTED TO THEIR DOUBLE PRESSURE
1624-168623-0049 THE MAN AND THE WOMAN EACH HAD A DIFFERENT METHOD COSETTE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH BLOWS THIS WAS THE WOMAN'S SHE WENT BAREFOOTED IN WINTER THAT WAS THE MAN'S DOING
1624-168623-0050 COSETTE RAN UP STAIRS AND DOWN WASHED SWEPT RUBBED DUSTED RAN FLUTTERED ABOUT PANTED MOVED HEAVY ARTICLES AND WEAK AS SHE WAS DID THE COARSE WORK THERE WAS NO MERCY FOR HER
1624-168623-0051 A FIERCE MISTRESS AND VENOMOUS MASTER THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB IN WHICH COSETTE HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND WHERE SHE LAY TREMBLING THE IDEAL OF OPPRESSION WAS REALIZED BY THIS SINISTER HOUSEHOLD
1624-168623-0052 IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE FLY SERVING THE SPIDERS THE POOR CHILD PASSIVELY HELD HER PEACE WHAT TAKES PLACE WITHIN THESE SOULS WHEN THEY HAVE BUT JUST QUITTED GOD FIND THEMSELVES THUS
1624-168623-0053 AT THE VERY DAWN OF LIFE VERY SMALL
1841-150351-0000 THE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE THE EXPLORERS AND EARLY SETTLERS FOUND A NATIVE RACE OCCUPYING NEARLY EVERY PORTION OF OUR CONTINENT THESE PEOPLE HAD MANY CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON AND WERE ALL CALLED INDIANS
1841-150351-0001 IN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE SURFACE IS BROKEN BY NUMEROUS BARRIERS SUCH AS MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS ALMOST EVERY VALLEY WAS FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY A DISTINCT GROUP OF INDIANS CALLED A TRIBE
1841-150351-0002 THE LANGUAGE OF EACH TRIBE DIFFERED SO MUCH FROM THE LANGUAGES OF ADJOINING TRIBES THAT THEY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER THESE TRIBES WERE ALMOST CONTINUALLY AT WAR
1841-150351-0003 THE INDIANS UPON THE PACIFIC SLOPE WERE GENERALLY FOUND TO BE INFERIOR IN MOST RESPECTS TO THOSE LIVING IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CONTINENT ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT THE TRIBES POSSESSING THE FAIR AND FERTILE VALLEYS OF CALIFORNIA
1841-150351-0004 WOULD BE THE MOST ADVANCED IN CIVILIZATION BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE MANY OF THEM WERE AMONG THE MOST DEGRADED UPON THE CONTINENT THEY SEEMED UNABLE TO ADAPT THEMSELVES TO THE WHITE MAN AND HIS WAYS
1841-150351-0005 AND IN THE OLDER SETTLED DISTRICTS THEY HAVE NOW NEARLY DISAPPEARED IN THE NEWER PORTIONS OF THE NORTHWEST AND ALONG THE COAST TOWARD ALASKA THE INDIANS HAVE NOT YET COME INTO SO DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE WHITE MEN
1841-150351-0006 THEY DID NOT CULTIVATE THE SOIL NOR DID THEY HUNT A GREAT DEAL ALTHOUGH THE COUNTRY ABOUNDED WITH GAME
1841-150351-0007 THESE INDIANS HAVE OFTEN BEEN CALLED DIGGERS BECAUSE THEY DEPENDED SO LARGELY FOR THEIR LIVING UPON THE ROOTS WHICH THEY DUG IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL THAT ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO BAY THE NATIVES SHOULD HAVE USED CANOES
1841-150351-0008 BUT ACCORDING TO EARLY TRAVELLERS THEY HAD NONE WHEN THEY WISHED TO GO OUT UPON THE WATER THEY BUILT RAFTS OF BUNDLES OF RUSHES OR TULES TIED TOGETHER AT FAVORABLE POINTS ALONG THE SHORE THE INDIANS COLLECTED FOR THEIR FEASTS
1841-150351-0009 AND THESE SPOTS ARE NOW INDICATED BY HEAPS OF SHELLS IN SOME PLACES FORMING MOUNDS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE
1841-150351-0010 IN THE MOUNTAINS THE SITES OF THE VILLAGES ARE MARKED BY CHIPS OF OBSIDIAN A VOLCANIC GLASS USED IN MAKING ARROW TIPS AND BY HOLES IN THE FLAT SURFACES OF GRANITIC ROCKS NEAR SOME SPRING OR STREAM
1841-150351-0011 THESE HOLES WERE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GRINDING ACORNS OR NUTS MANY OF THE INDIAN TRIBES DEVELOPED GREAT SKILL IN THE WEAVING OF BASKETS WHICH THEY USED FOR MANY DIFFERENT PURPOSES
1841-150351-0012 THE BASKETS ARE STILL MADE IN SOME PLACES AND ARE MUCH SOUGHT AFTER BECAUSE OF THEIR BEAUTY THE INDIANS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN BUILDING THEIR HOMES DUG ROUND SHALLOW HOLES OVER WHICH POLES WERE BENT IN THE FORM OF A HALF CIRCLE
1841-150351-0013 AND AFTER HE HAD ENTERED AND ALL OPENINGS WERE CLOSED HE POURED WATER UPON THE STONES UNTIL THE ROOM WAS FILLED WITH STEAM AFTER ENDURING THIS PROCESS AS LONG AS HE DESIRED THE INDIAN CAME OUT AND PLUNGED INTO THE COLD WATER OF A NEAR BY STREAM
1841-150351-0014 AS MAY BE IMAGINED SUCH A BATH OFTEN RESULTED DISASTROUSLY TO THE WEAK OR SICK THE FACT THAT THE CALIFORNIA INDIANS COULD SUPPORT THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY GREAT EXERTION
1841-150351-0015 AT CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHEN SALMON WERE PLENTIFUL EACH TRIBE OR GROUP OF INDIANS ESTABLISHED ITS CAMP NEAR ONE OF THE MANY RAPIDS AND WATERFALLS ALONG THE COLUMBIA RIVER LARGE NUMBERS OF THE SALMON WERE CAUGHT BY THE USE OF TRAPS
1841-150351-0016 AFTER BEING PARTLY DRIED THEY WERE PACKED IN BALES FOR WINTER USE THE FISH THUS PREPARED WERE CONSIDERED VERY VALUABLE AND FORMED AN ARTICLE OF TRADE WITH THE TRIBES LIVING FARTHER FROM THE RIVER
1841-150351-0017 BUT THIS ENTHUSIASM QUICKLY DISAPPEARS IF A HEAD WIND COMES UP AND THE PARTY GOES ASHORE TO WAIT FOR THE BREEZE TO TURN IN A MORE FAVORABLE DIRECTION THESE INDIANS AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED LIVE LARGELY UPON FISH
1841-150351-0018 BERRIES ARE ABUNDANT DURING THE SUMMER AND ARE ALSO MUCH USED FOR FOOD THE CLOTHING OF THE INDIANS WAS ORIGINALLY A SORT OF BLANKET MADE OF THE WOVEN FIBRES OF CEDAR BARK OR MORE RARELY OF THE SKINS OF ANIMALS
1841-150351-0019 AND LEAVING IT THERE WHILE THE HEAD IS GROWING
1841-150351-0020 THE BUILDINGS ARE STRUNG ALONG THE SHORE CLOSE UNDER THE EDGE OF THE THICK FOREST AND JUST ABOVE THE REACH OF THE WAVES AT HIGH TIDE THEY ARE VERY SOLIDLY CONSTRUCTED
1841-150351-0021 FOR THESE INDIANS DO NOT MOVE ABOUT AS MUCH AS THOSE FARTHER SOUTH WHERE THE FORESTS ARE LESS DENSE FIGURE SIXTY FIVE SHOWS THE FRAMEWORK OF A PARTIALLY BUILT HOUSE WHILE ANOTHER STANDS AT ONE SIDE COMPLETED
1841-150351-0022 LARGE POSTS ARE SET IN THE GROUND AT THE CORNERS AND ENDS OF THE BUILDING CROSS LOGS ARE THEN PLACED UPON THE MIDDLE POSTS
1841-150351-0023 THIS IS SOMETIMES TWO FEET IN DIAMETER AND FROM SIXTY TO EIGHTY FEET LONG IT MUST REQUIRE THE UNITED STRENGTH OF MANY MEN TO ROLL SUCH A LOG INTO POSITION UPON THE FRAMEWORK THUS CONSTRUCTED SPLIT CEDAR BOARDS ARE FASTENED
1841-150351-0024 AND THE BUILDING IS PRACTICALLY FINISHED SUCH A HOUSE IS USUALLY OCCUPIED BY A NUMBER OF FAMILIES UPON QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS THERE IS A DWELLING OF THIS KIND LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD SEVEN HUNDRED INDIANS
1841-150351-0025 THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES ARE ORNAMENTED WITH FIGURES HEWN OUT OF WOOD THESE REPRESENT MEN BIRDS AND ANIMALS AND HAVE A RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE SOMETIMES THESE FIGURES ARE MOUNTED UPON THE TOPS OF TALL POLES
1841-150351-0026 THE TOTEM POLE IS A MOST INTERESTING AFFAIR FIGURE SIXTY SIX REPRESENTS THE POLE AT ALERT BAY EAST OF VANCOUVER ISLAND IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST UPON THE NORTH COAST
1841-150351-0027 THE FIGURES OF ANIMALS AND BIRDS CARVED UPON IT REPRESENT THE MYTHOLOGICAL ANCESTORS OF THE FAMILY OR CLAN IN FRONT OF WHOSE ABODE THE POLE STANDS THE INDIANS OFTEN HUNT SIMILAR ANIMALS TO DAY
1841-150351-0028 BUT BELIEVE THAT THEIR ANCESTORS HAD SUPERNATURAL POWER WHICH RAISED THEM ABOVE THE ORDINARY CREATURES THE CHINOOK INDIANS LIVE UPON THE LOWER COLUMBIA
1841-150351-0029 THE NAME CHINOOK HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A WARM DRY WIND WHICH BLOWS DOWN THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND OUT UPON THE GREAT PLAINS THIS WIND IS SO NAMED BECAUSE IT BLOWS FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE CHINOOK INDIANS COUNTRY
1841-150351-0030 THE CHINOOK JARGON IS A STRANGE SORT OF MIXED LANGUAGE WITH WHICH NEARLY ALL THE TRIBES OF THE NORTHWEST ARE FAMILIAR IT IS FORMED OF WORDS FROM THE CHINOOK LANGUAGE TOGETHER WITH OTHERS FROM DIFFERENT INDIAN LANGUAGES
1841-150351-0031 IT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THESE AMERICAN INDIANS ORIGINALLY CAME ACROSS THE NARROW STRIP OF WATER SEPARATING ASIA FROM AMERICA WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THE INDIANS HAVE OCCUPIED OUR COUNTRY
1841-150351-0032 BUT IT HAS PROBABLY BEEN SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS SOME OF THE MAIN GROUPS HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN HERE LONGER THAN OTHERS
1841-159771-0000 THERE'S NO SENSE IN WASTING OUR TIME HERE SAID SOLOMON OWL TO HIS SMALL COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER IT'S A FINE NIGHT THE MICE WILL ALL BE OUT SOONER OR LATER LET'S GO OVER AND SIT IN THAT OLD OAK ON THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW
1841-159771-0001 SIMON SCREECHER WAS MORE THAN WILLING AND THEY HAD NO SOONER SETTLED THEMSELVES AMONG THE BARE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHEN SIMON STARTED TO AMUSE HIMSELF BY GIVING HIS WELL KNOWN QUAVERING WHISTLE SOLOMON OWL STOPPED HIM QUICKLY
1841-159771-0002 DON'T DO THAT HE SAID SHARPLY DO YOU WANT TO SCARE THE MICE SIMON SCREECHER CUT HIS WHISTLE OFF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT I FORGOT HE MURMURED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE MY WHISTLING WOULD DO ANY HARM
1841-159771-0003 I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY MICE LEFT ON FARMER GREEN'S PLACE IT'S MY OPINION THAT THEY'VE MOVED AWAY MOST OF THEM OR MAYBE OLD ROUGH LEG THE HAWK HAS CAUGHT MORE THAN HIS SHARE
1841-159771-0004 SOLOMON OWL MADE NO REPLY HE WAS A PERSON OF FEW WORDS IF ANYBODY ASKED HIS OPINION HE WAS READY TO GIVE IT BUT HE SELDOM GAVE ANY UNSOUGHT ADVICE
1841-159771-0005 I'VE ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND SAID SIMON SCREECHER THAT I'D MOVE TO SOME OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD IF I KNEW WHERE THERE WAS GOOD MOUSING I'D MOVE TO MORROW WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING SOLOMON OWL STARTED EVER SO SLIGHTLY
1841-159771-0006 YOU MIGHT AS WELL SEND THEM A TELEGRAM SAYING THAT YOU'LL BE ON HAND TO MEET THEM AT EIGHT P M SIMON SCREECHER WAS SILENCED FOR THE TIME BEING AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE SOLOMON OWL GAVE ANOTHER START THERE'S THAT SQUEAK AGAIN HE WHISPERED
1841-159771-0007 I BELIEVE IT IS GETTING NEARER TOO NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HAD A TUNNEL THAT LED RIGHT BENEATH THE TREE WHERE THE TWO COUSINS WERE SITTING
1841-159771-0008 AND HE HAD STROLLED THAT WAY AFTER SCURRYING UNDER THE SNOW WHEN HE HEARD SOLOMON OWL LAUGHING IN THE WOODS EARLIER IN THE EVENING IT WAS HE THAT SOLOMON HEARD IT WAS HE THAT STUCK HIS HEAD OUT OF A HOLE IN THE SNOW AND PEEPED UP AT THE STAR SPRINKLED SKY
1841-159771-0009 HE MUST HAVE HURRIED OVER HERE FROM THE WOODS HE MUST BE VERY HUNGRY AS SOLOMON OWL RETURNED TO THE OLD OAK HIS COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER LAUGHED SOMEWHAT UNPLEASANTLY MISSED HIM DIDN'T YOU HE INQUIRED YES
1841-159771-0010 WHY DIDN'T YOU GRAB HIM OUT OF THE SNOW SIMON ASKED WHAT ARE YOUR CLAWS FOR WHAT'S YOUR BEAK FOR I COULDN'T DIG HIM OUT SOLOMON OWL REPLIED THE SNOW IS THREE FEET DEEP
1841-159771-0011 AND IT HAS SEVEN DIFFERENT CRUSTS ONE UNDER ANOTHER THIS IS A HARD WINTER SAID SIMON SCREECHER I WISH I'D GONE SOUTH LAST FALL I WONDER HOW THE MOUSING IS DOWN THERE
1841-159771-0012 EATING A TREE AS SIMON SCREECHER REMARKED TO HIS COUSIN SOLOMON OWL IT WAS A HARD WINTER THE SNOW WAS DEEP THE DAYS WERE COLD AND THE NIGHTS WERE COLDER AND WORST OF ALL FOOD BECAME SCARCE
1841-159771-0013 IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO EAT ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT THE FARM BUILDINGS WHICH FARMER GREEN HAD STUFFED FULL OF HAY AND GRAIN DURING THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN MANY OF THE FOREST FOLK STOLE DOWN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN AFTER NIGHTFALL
1841-159771-0014 AND VISITED THE FARMYARD IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A BITE OF SOMETHING OR OTHER EVEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BEGAN TO FIND IT HARDER AND HARDER TO GET ENOUGH SEEDS UNDER THE SNOW TO SATISFY HIS HUNGER
1841-159771-0015 HE HAD STORED AWAY A STOCK OF FOOD BUT IT HADN'T BEEN BIG ENOUGH AND THAT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE PROMISED HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT REPEAT IT ANOTHER TIME
1841-159771-0016 UNFORTUNATELY ALL THE PROMISES IN THE WORLD WOULDN'T GIVE HIM A SQUARE MEAL WHEN HE NEEDED ONE
1841-159771-0017 THIS IS MY FIRST WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE EXPLAINED I'M RUNNING SHORT OF FOOD AND I WISH YOU'D TELL ME WHAT TO DO IN SUCH A CASE THAT'S EASY HIS COUSIN ANSWERED GET MORE
1841-159771-0018 AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY FOR HE HAD IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO POOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE RAN AFTER HIM IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW HIS COUSIN THROUGH THE WINDING GALLERIES BENEATH THE SNOW
1841-159771-0019 SEVERAL TIMES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TOOK THE WRONG TURN AND HAD TO RETRACE HIS STEPS BUT AT LAST HE FOUND HIS BUSY COUSIN AGAIN YOU ADVISED ME TO GET MORE FOOD SAID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHERE TO GET IT
1841-159771-0020 IN THE ORCHARD HIS COUSIN CRIED AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY AGAIN I WISH HE'D WAIT A MINUTE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE GRUMBLED AS HE TORE AFTER HIS COUSIN ONCE MORE
1841-159771-0021 I DON'T FEEL LIKE RUNNING I HAVEN'T HAD A HEARTY MEAL FOR DAYS THE COUSIN SEEMED SURPRISED WHEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE OVERTOOK HIM WHAT THAT BUSY GENTLEMAN EXCLAIMED HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE ORCHARD AND BACK SO SOON NO
1841-159771-0022 HAVING SAID THOSE THREE WORDS HE DASHED OFF AGAIN EVEN FASTER THAN BEFORE TREES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ECHOED I CAN'T EAT TREES
1841-159771-0023 THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT MY COUSIN FORGOT TO EXPLAIN SO I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE TO RUN AFTER HIM AGAIN AND ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANT THE FOURTH TIME THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE FOUND HIS COUSIN HE TOOK NO CHANCES
1841-159771-0024 HE CAUGHT HIS COUSIN BY HIS TAIL AND HELD ON FIRMLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY FROM ME TILL I'VE FOUND OUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW HE DECLARED HOW CAN I EAT A TREE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE DEMANDED YOU CAN'T
1841-159771-0025 HIS COUSIN REPLIED STRUGGLING DESPERATELY TO FREE HIMSELF FOR HE WAS TOO BUSY TO STOP LONG THEN EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CRIED EAT THE BARK HIS COUSIN ANSWERED
1841-159771-0026 THEN AND NOT TILL THEN DID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE LET HIM GO MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CHASED HIS COUSIN NO MORE BUT HURRIED AWAY TO FARMER GREEN'S ORCHARD WHERE HE GNAWED A RING
1841-159771-0027 BUT FARMER GREEN DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM WHEN HE HAPPENED TO GO INTO THE ORCHARD ONE DAY LATER AND SAW TREE AFTER TREE RUINED HE WAS VERY VERY MUCH DISPLEASED
1841-159771-0028 I OUGHT TO HAVE PUT WIRE NETTING AROUND THOSE YOUNG TREES HE TOLD THE HIRED MAN THIS IS WHAT COMES OF A HARD WINTER
1841-159771-0029 A COLD DIP IN ONE WAY PETER MINK WAS LIKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HE ENJOYED SWIMMING AND HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF HIS TIME ALONG THE STREAMS THAT THREADED THEIR WAY THROUGH PLEASANT VALLEY SOMETIMES PETER DAWDLED ON THE BANKS OF SWIFT RIVER
1841-159771-0030 SOMETIMES HE LINGERED FOR DAYS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BLACK CREEK NOR DID HE DISDAIN SO SMALL A STREAM AS THE BROOK THAT CROSSED THE MEADOW IT WAS DEEP ENOUGH FOR A SWIM AND HE KNEW THAT MUSKRATS LIVED UNDER ITS BANKS
1841-159771-0031 WELL PETER MINK HAD SURPRISED MANY A ONE SWIMMING IN THE BROOK IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE MEADOW MICE PERHAPS HE WOULDN'T HAVE VISITED THE BROOK SO OFTEN EVEN IN WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE JUST HAD TO HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN
1841-159771-0032 JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS SKATING FOR JOHNNIE GREEN ON TOP OF THE BROOK IT MUSTN'T BE SUPPOSED THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE A SWIM WHEN HE WANTED ONE
1841-159771-0033 WHEN PETER MINK WANDERED ALONG A STREAM IN WINTER HE PREFERRED TO TRAVEL UNDER THE ICE RATHER THAN WALK UPON THE UPPER SIDE OF IT
1841-159771-0034 IT MADE LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO HIM WHETHER THERE WAS A DRY STRIP ALONG THE EDGE OF THE STREAM WHERE HE COULD STEAL SILENTLY ALONG WITHOUT WETTING HIS FEET WHEN HE FOUND NO PLACE TO WALK HE SWAM NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS TRICK OF PETER MINK'S
1841-159771-0035 THIS TRICK OF LURKING BENEATH THE ICE OF RIVER CREEK AND BROOK BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WOULD HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN DESPITE PETER MINK AND HIS PROWLING WAYS TO BE SURE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TRIED TO BE CAREFUL
1841-159771-0036 BEFORE HE CREPT FROM THE END OF HIS TUNNEL HE STUCK HIS HEAD OUT AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN AND ALL AROUND HE PEEPED UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK HE EVEN STARED INTO THE WATER AND THEN IF HE SAW NOBODY THAT WAS FIERCER THAN PADDY MUSKRAT
1841-159771-0037 ONLY THEN WOULD HE VENTURE TO SKIP TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND PLUNGE IN TO TELL THE TRUTH MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS FELT SAFER WHEN ONE OF THE MUSKRAT FAMILY HAPPENED TO BE TAKING A SWIM AT THE SAME TIME
1841-159771-0038 FOR THE MUSKRATS ALL HAD A WARNING SIGNAL THAT TOLD EVERYBODY WHEN THERE WAS DANGER WHEN ONE OF THEM CAUGHT SIGHT OF PETER MINK HE NEVER FAILED IF HE WAS IN THE WATER TO GIVE A LOUD SLAP UPON THE SURFACE WITH HIS TAIL
1841-159771-0039 MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS HAD ONE EAR THAT WAS LISTENING FOR THAT SLAP AND WHEN IT SOUNDED HE NEVER WAITED AN INSTANT BUT DARTED INTO HIS TUNNEL WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING TO SHAKE THE WATER OFF HIS COAT
1841-159771-0040 HE SAID THAT HE COULD DRY HIS COAT AFTER HE REACHED HOME WHILE IF HE STOPPED TO DRY IT AT THE EDGE OF THE BROOK PERHAPS HE'D NEVER GET HOME AT ALL YOU MIGHT THINK THAT NOW AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF
1841-159771-0041 OH I WON'T BOTHER TO LOOK FOR PETER MINK TO DAY HE MUST BE MILES AWAY I'LL STEP RIGHT OUT OF MY TUNNEL AND HAVE MY SWIM WITHOUT TAKING A LOOK SEE FIRST BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS NEVER SO LAZY AS THAT
1841-159771-0042 AND THE DAY CAME AT LAST WHEN IT WAS WELL WORTH HIS WHILE TO TAKE THE LITTLE EXTRA TROUBLE OF PEEPING OUT BEFORE HE HAD HIS SWIM FOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A SNAKELIKE HEAD THAT DARTED OUT FROM UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK AND DARTED BACK AGAIN OUT OF SIGHT
1841-179183-0000 AND HIS TONGUE GAVE MY HAND A LICK HE PRESSED CLOSE TO ME AS IF HE WERE FAIN TO CROWD HIMSELF INTO MY HAND HE LOVED IT WITH HIS TAIL WITH HIS PAW WITH HIS TONGUE IF HE COULD SPEAK I BELIEVE HE WOULD SAY WITH ME
1841-179183-0001 THAT PARADISE IS ATTAINED BY TOUCH FOR IN TOUCH IS ALL LOVE AND INTELLIGENCE THIS SMALL INCIDENT STARTED ME ON A CHAT ABOUT HANDS AND IF MY CHAT IS FORTUNATE I HAVE TO THANK MY DOG STAR
1841-179183-0002 IN ANY CASE IT IS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS MONOPOLIZED IT IS LIKE MAKING A NEW PATH IN THE TRACKLESS WOODS BLAZING THE TRAIL WHERE NO FOOT HAS PRESSED BEFORE
1841-179183-0003 I AM GLAD TO TAKE YOU BY THE HAND AND LEAD YOU ALONG AN UNTRODDEN WAY INTO A WORLD WHERE THE HAND IS SUPREME BUT AT THE VERY OUTSET WE ENCOUNTER A DIFFICULTY YOU ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO LIGHT
1841-179183-0004 I PROMISE THAT YOU SHALL NOT BE LED INTO FIRE OR WATER OR FALL INTO A DEEP PIT IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME PATIENTLY YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE'S A SOUND SO FINE NOTHING LIVES TWIXT IT AND SILENCE
1841-179183-0005 AND THAT THERE IS MORE MEANT IN THINGS THAN MEETS THE EYE MY HAND IS TO ME WHAT YOUR HEARING AND SIGHT TOGETHER ARE TO YOU IN LARGE MEASURE WE TRAVEL THE SAME HIGHWAYS READ THE SAME BOOKS SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE
1841-179183-0006 A SLIGHT FLUTTER OF THE FINGERS BEGAN THE INTELLIGENCE THE JOY THE FULLNESS OF MY LIFE LIKE JOB I FEEL AS IF A HAND HAD MADE ME FASHIONED ME TOGETHER ROUND ABOUT AND MOULDED MY VERY SOUL
1841-179183-0007 IN ALL MY EXPERIENCES AND THOUGHTS I AM CONSCIOUS OF A HAND WHATEVER MOVES ME WHATEVER THRILLS ME IS AS A HAND THAT TOUCHES ME IN THE DARK AND THAT TOUCH IS MY REALITY YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT A SIGHT WHICH MAKES YOU GLAD
1841-179183-0008 ALL THESE AND A THOUSAND RESULTANT COMBINATIONS WHICH TAKE SHAPE IN MY MIND CONSTITUTE MY WORLD IDEAS MAKE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN AND IMPRESSIONS FURNISH IDEAS MY WORLD IS BUILT OF TOUCH SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0009 BUT WITHOUT COLOUR AND SOUND IT BREATHES AND THROBS WITH LIFE
1841-179183-0010 OF BEAUTY OR OF INCONGRUITY FOR WITH MY HANDS I CAN FEEL THE COMIC AS WELL AS THE BEAUTIFUL IN THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THINGS REMEMBER THAT YOU DEPENDENT ON YOUR SIGHT DO NOT REALIZE HOW MANY THINGS ARE TANGIBLE
1841-179183-0011 ALL PALPABLE THINGS ARE MOBILE OR RIGID SOLID OR LIQUID BIG OR SMALL WARM OR COLD AND THESE QUALITIES ARE VARIOUSLY MODIFIED
1841-179183-0012 THE COOLNESS OF A WATER LILY ROUNDING INTO BLOOM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE COOLNESS OF AN EVENING WIND IN SUMMER AND DIFFERENT AGAIN FROM THE COOLNESS OF THE RAIN THAT SOAKS INTO THE HEARTS OF GROWING THINGS AND GIVES THEM LIFE AND BODY
1841-179183-0013 THE VELVET OF THE ROSE IS NOT THAT OF A RIPE PEACH OR OF A BABY'S DIMPLED CHEEK THE HARDNESS OF THE ROCK IS TO THE HARDNESS OF WOOD WHAT A MAN'S DEEP BASS IS TO A WOMAN'S VOICE WHEN IT IS LOW
1841-179183-0014 WHAT I CALL BEAUTY I FIND IN CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF ALL THESE QUALITIES AND IS LARGELY DERIVED FROM THE FLOW OF CURVED AND STRAIGHT LINES WHICH IS OVER ALL THINGS WHAT DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE MEAN TO YOU
1841-179183-0015 IT MEANS SEVERAL THINGS IT SYMBOLIZES DUTY IT SEEMS TO HAVE THE QUALITY OF INEXORABLENESS THAT DUTY HAS WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO THAT MUST NOT BE SET ASIDE I FEEL AS IF I WERE GOING FORWARD IN A STRAIGHT LINE
1841-179183-0016 OR GO ON FOREVER WITHOUT SWERVING TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO ESCAPE THIS MORALIZING YOU SHOULD ASK HOW DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE FEEL IT FEELS AS I SUPPOSE IT LOOKS STRAIGHT
1841-179183-0017 NOW BROKEN OFF OR LENGTHENED OR SWELLING THEY RISE AND SINK BENEATH MY FINGERS THEY ARE FULL OF SUDDEN STARTS AND PAUSES AND THEIR VARIETY IS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND WONDERFUL SO YOU SEE I AM NOT SHUT OUT FROM THE REGION OF THE BEAUTIFUL
1841-179183-0018 THOUGH MY HAND CANNOT PERCEIVE THE BRILLIANT COLOURS IN THE SUNSET OR ON THE MOUNTAIN OR REACH INTO THE BLUE DEPTHS OF THE SKY PHYSICS TELLS ME THAT I AM WELL OFF IN A WORLD WHICH I AM TOLD KNOWS NEITHER COLD NOR SOUND
1841-179183-0019 FOR AT LEAST EVERY OBJECT APPEARS TO MY FINGERS STANDING SOLIDLY RIGHT SIDE UP AND IS NOT AN INVERTED IMAGE ON THE RETINA WHICH I UNDERSTAND YOUR BRAIN IS AT INFINITE THOUGH UNCONSCIOUS LABOUR TO SET BACK ON ITS FEET
1841-179183-0020 A TANGIBLE OBJECT PASSES COMPLETE INTO MY BRAIN WITH THE WARMTH OF LIFE UPON IT AND OCCUPIES THE SAME PLACE THAT IT DOES IN SPACE FOR WITHOUT EGOTISM THE MIND IS AS LARGE AS THE UNIVERSE
1841-179183-0021 WHEN I THINK OF HILLS I THINK OF THE UPWARD STRENGTH I TREAD UPON WHEN WATER IS THE OBJECT OF MY THOUGHT I FEEL THE COOL SHOCK OF THE PLUNGE AND THE QUICK YIELDING OF THE WAVES THAT CRISP AND CURL AND RIPPLE ABOUT MY BODY
1841-179183-0022 THE PLEASING CHANGES OF ROUGH AND SMOOTH PLIANT AND RIGID CURVED AND STRAIGHT IN THE BARK AND BRANCHES OF A TREE GIVE THE TRUTH TO MY HAND THE IMMOVABLE ROCK WITH ITS JUTS AND WARPED SURFACE
1841-179183-0023 A BIRD IN MY HAND WAS THEN WORTH TWO IN THE BARNYARD MY FINGERS CANNOT OF COURSE GET THE IMPRESSION OF A LARGE WHOLE AT A GLANCE BUT I FEEL THE PARTS AND MY MIND PUTS THEM TOGETHER
1841-179183-0024 I MOVE AROUND MY HOUSE TOUCHING OBJECT AFTER OBJECT IN ORDER BEFORE I CAN FORM AN IDEA OF THE ENTIRE HOUSE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES I CAN TOUCH ONLY WHAT IS SHOWN TO ME THE CHIEF OBJECTS OF INTEREST
1841-179183-0025 CARVINGS ON THE WALL OR A CURIOUS ARCHITECTURAL FEATURE EXHIBITED LIKE THE FAMILY ALBUM THEREFORE A HOUSE WITH WHICH I AM NOT FAMILIAR HAS FOR ME AT FIRST NO GENERAL EFFECT OR HARMONY OF DETAIL
1841-179183-0026 IT IS NOT A COMPLETE CONCEPTION BUT A COLLECTION OF OBJECT IMPRESSIONS WHICH AS THEY COME TO ME ARE DISCONNECTED AND ISOLATED BUT MY MIND IS FULL OF ASSOCIATIONS SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0027 THEORIES AND WITH THEM IT CONSTRUCTS THE HOUSE THE PROCESS REMINDS ME OF THE BUILDING OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE
1841-179183-0028 THE SILENT WORKER IS IMAGINATION WHICH DECREES REALITY OUT OF CHAOS WITHOUT IMAGINATION WHAT A POOR THING MY WORLD WOULD BE
1841-179183-0029 MY GARDEN WOULD BE A SILENT PATCH OF EARTH STREWN WITH STICKS OF A VARIETY OF SHAPES AND SMELLS BUT WHEN THE EYE OF MY MIND IS OPENED TO ITS BEAUTY THE BARE GROUND BRIGHTENS BENEATH MY FEET AND THE HEDGE ROW BURSTS INTO LEAF
1841-179183-0030 AND THE ROSE TREE SHAKES ITS FRAGRANCE EVERYWHERE I KNOW HOW BUDDING TREES LOOK AND I ENTER INTO THE AMOROUS JOY OF THE MATING BIRDS AND THIS IS THE MIRACLE OF IMAGINATION
1841-179183-0031 WHICH HE HAS EMBODIED IN A SCULPTURED FORM ALTHOUGH COMPARED WITH THE LIFE WARM MOBILE FACE OF A FRIEND THE MARBLE IS COLD AND PULSELESS AND UNRESPONSIVE YET IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO MY HAND
1841-179183-0032 ITS FLOWING CURVES AND BENDINGS ARE A REAL PLEASURE ONLY BREATH IS WANTING BUT UNDER THE SPELL OF THE IMAGINATION THE MARBLE THRILLS AND BECOMES THE DIVINE REALITY OF THE IDEAL IMAGINATION PUTS A SENTIMENT INTO EVERY LINE AND CURVE
1841-179183-0033 AND THE STATUE IN MY TOUCH IS INDEED THE GODDESS HERSELF WHO BREATHES AND MOVES AND ENCHANTS IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT SOME SCULPTURES EVEN RECOGNIZED MASTERPIECES DO NOT PLEASE MY HAND
1841-179183-0034 WHEN I TOUCH WHAT THERE IS OF THE WINGED VICTORY IT REMINDS ME AT FIRST OF A HEADLESS LIMBLESS DREAM THAT FLIES TOWARDS ME IN AN UNRESTFUL SLEEP
1841-179183-0035 THE GARMENTS OF THE VICTORY THRUST STIFFLY OUT BEHIND AND DO NOT RESEMBLE GARMENTS THAT I HAVE FELT FLYING FLUTTERING FOLDING SPREADING IN THE WIND
1841-179183-0036 BUT IMAGINATION FULFILS THESE IMPERFECTIONS AND STRAIGHTWAY THE VICTORY BECOMES A POWERFUL AND SPIRITED FIGURE WITH THE SWEEP OF SEA WINDS IN HER ROBES AND THE SPLENDOUR OF CONQUEST IN HER WINGS
1841-179183-0037 AND I LIKE THE LUXURIANT WAVY HAIR OF BACCHUS AND APOLLO AND THE WREATH OF IVY SO SUGGESTIVE OF PAGAN HOLIDAYS SO IMAGINATION CROWNS THE EXPERIENCE OF MY HANDS
1841-179183-0038 AND THEY LEARNED THEIR CUNNING FROM THE WISE HAND OF ANOTHER WHICH ITSELF GUIDED BY IMAGINATION LED ME SAFELY IN PATHS THAT I KNEW NOT
1963-142393-0000 ADAM UNDERSTOOD DINAH'S HASTE TO GO AWAY AND DREW HOPE RATHER THAN DISCOURAGEMENT FROM IT
1963-142393-0001 I WISH I'D ASKED HER TO WRITE TO ME THOUGH HE THOUGHT AND YET
1963-142393-0002 SHE WANTS TO BE QUITE QUIET IN HER OLD WAY FOR A WHILE AND I'VE NO RIGHT TO BE IMPATIENT AND INTERRUPTING HER WITH MY WISHES SHE'S TOLD ME WHAT HER MIND IS AND SHE'S NOT A WOMAN TO SAY ONE THING AND MEAN ANOTHER
1963-142393-0003 I'LL WAIT PATIENTLY THAT WAS ADAM'S WISE RESOLUTION AND IT THROVE EXCELLENTLY FOR THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WEEKS ON THE NOURISHMENT IT GOT
1963-142393-0004 BUT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER THE RESOLUTION BEGAN TO DWINDLE PERCEPTIBLY AND SHOWED DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS OF EXHAUSTION THE WEEKS WERE UNUSUALLY LONG DINAH MUST SURELY HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE UP HER MIND
1963-142393-0005 HE IS A LITTLE TOO FLUSHED AND EXALTED WITH THAT FIRST DRAUGHT SHE OFFERS HIM TO CARE MUCH ABOUT THE TASTE OF THE SECOND HE TREADS THE EARTH WITH A VERY ELASTIC STEP AS HE WALKS AWAY FROM HER AND MAKES LIGHT OF ALL DIFFICULTIES
1963-142393-0006 BUT THAT SORT OF GLOW DIES OUT MEMORY GETS SADLY DILUTED WITH TIME AND IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REVIVE US ADAM WAS NO LONGER SO CONFIDENT AS HE HAD BEEN HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PERHAPS DINAH'S OLD LIFE
1963-142393-0007 WOULD HAVE TOO STRONG A GRASP UPON HER
1963-142393-0008 IF SHE HAD NOT FELT THIS SHE WOULD SURELY HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM TO GIVE HIM SOME COMFORT BUT IT APPEARED THAT SHE HELD IT RIGHT TO DISCOURAGE HIM AS ADAM'S CONFIDENCE WANED HIS PATIENCE WANED WITH IT
1963-142393-0009 AND HE THOUGHT HE MUST WRITE HIMSELF HE MUST ASK DINAH NOT TO LEAVE HIM IN PAINFUL DOUBT LONGER THAN WAS NEEDFUL HE SAT UP LATE ONE NIGHT TO WRITE HER A LETTER BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE BURNT IT AFRAID OF ITS EFFECT
1963-142393-0010 IT WOULD BE WORSE TO HAVE A DISCOURAGING ANSWER BY LETTER THAN FROM HER OWN LIPS FOR HER PRESENCE RECONCILED HIM TO HER WILL YOU PERCEIVE HOW IT WAS ADAM WAS HUNGERING FOR THE SIGHT OF DINAH
1963-142393-0011 AND WHEN THAT SORT OF HUNGER REACHES A CERTAIN STAGE A LOVER IS LIKELY TO STILL IT THOUGH HE MAY HAVE TO PUT HIS FUTURE IN PAWN BUT WHAT HARM COULD HE DO BY GOING TO SNOWFIELD DINAH COULD NOT BE DISPLEASED WITH HIM FOR IT
1963-142393-0012 SHE HAD NOT FORBIDDEN HIM TO GO SHE MUST SURELY EXPECT THAT HE WOULD GO BEFORE LONG BY THE SECOND SUNDAY IN OCTOBER
1963-142393-0013 THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO SNOWFIELD ON HORSEBACK THIS TIME FOR HIS HOURS WERE PRECIOUS NOW AND HE HAD BORROWED JONATHAN BURGE'S GOOD NAG FOR THE JOURNEY WHAT KEEN MEMORIES WENT ALONG THE ROAD WITH HIM
1963-142393-0014 HE HAD OFTEN BEEN TO OAKBOURNE AND BACK SINCE THAT FIRST JOURNEY TO SNOWFIELD BUT BEYOND OAKBOURNE THE GREYSTONE WALLS THE BROKEN COUNTRY THE MEAGRE TREES SEEMED TO BE TELLING HIM AFRESH
1963-142393-0015 THE STORY OF THAT PAINFUL PAST WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL BY HEART BUT NO STORY IS THE SAME TO US AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME OR RATHER WE WHO READ IT ARE NO LONGER THE SAME INTERPRETERS AND ADAM
1963-142393-0016 THIS MORNING BROUGHT WITH HIM NEW THOUGHTS THROUGH THAT GREY COUNTRY THOUGHTS WHICH GAVE AN ALTERED SIGNIFICANCE TO ITS STORY OF THE PAST THAT IS A BASE
1963-142393-0017 AND SELFISH EVEN A BLASPHEMOUS SPIRIT WHICH REJOICES AND IS THANKFUL OVER THE PAST EVIL THAT HAS BLIGHTED OR CRUSHED ANOTHER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MADE A SOURCE OF UNFORESEEN GOOD TO OURSELVES
1963-142393-0018 ADAM COULD NEVER CEASE TO MOURN OVER THAT MYSTERY OF HUMAN SORROW WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT SO CLOSE TO HIM HE COULD NEVER THANK GOD FOR ANOTHER'S MISERY AND IF I WERE CAPABLE OF THAT NARROW SIGHTED JOY IN ADAM'S BEHALF
1963-142393-0019 I SHOULD STILL KNOW HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO FEEL IT FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HIS HEAD AT SUCH A SENTIMENT AND SAID EVIL'S EVIL AND SORROW'S SORROW
1963-142393-0020 BY WRAPPING IT UP IN OTHER WORDS OTHER FOLKS WERE NOT CREATED FOR MY SAKE THAT I SHOULD THINK ALL SQUARE WHEN THINGS TURN OUT WELL FOR ME BUT IT IS NOT IGNOBLE TO FEEL THAT THE FULLER LIFE
1963-142393-0021 WHICH A SAD EXPERIENCE HAS BROUGHT US IS WORTH OUR OWN PERSONAL SHARE OF PAIN SURELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FEEL OTHERWISE ANY MORE THAN IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
1963-142393-0022 BY WHICH HIS DIM BLURRED SIGHT OF MEN AS TREES WALKING HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR CLEAR OUTLINE AND EFFULGENT DAY THE GROWTH OF HIGHER FEELING WITHIN US IS LIKE THE GROWTH OF FACULTY
1963-142393-0023 WE CAN NO MORE WISH TO RETURN TO A NARROWER SYMPATHY THAN A PAINTER OR A MUSICIAN CAN WISH TO RETURN TO HIS CRUDER MANNER OR A PHILOSOPHER TO HIS LESS COMPLETE FORMULA
1963-142393-0024 SOMETHING LIKE THIS SENSE OF ENLARGED BEING WAS IN ADAM'S MIND THIS SUNDAY MORNING AS HE RODE ALONG IN VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST
1963-142393-0025 THE HOPE OF PASSING HIS LIFE WITH HER HAD BEEN THE DISTANT UNSEEN POINT TOWARDS WHICH THAT HARD JOURNEY FROM SNOWFIELD EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN LEADING HIM TENDER AND DEEP AS HIS LOVE FOR HETTY HAD BEEN
1963-142393-0026 SO DEEP THAT THE ROOTS OF IT WOULD NEVER BE TORN AWAY HIS LOVE FOR DINAH WAS BETTER AND MORE PRECIOUS TO HIM FOR IT WAS THE OUTGROWTH OF THAT FULLER LIFE WHICH HAD COME TO HIM FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH DEEP SORROW
1963-142393-0027 IT'S LIKE AS IF IT WAS A NEW STRENGTH TO ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AND KNOW AS SHE LOVES ME
1963-142393-0028 FOR SHE'S BETTER THAN I AM
1963-142393-0029 AS IF YOU COULD WALK MORE FEARLESS WHEN YOU'VE MORE TRUST IN ANOTHER
1963-142393-0030 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THINKING I KNEW BETTER THAN THEM AS BELONGED TO ME
1963-142393-0031 WHEN YOU CAN'T LOOK TO THEM NEAREST TO YOU T HELP YOU WITH A BIT BETTER THOUGHT
1963-142393-0032 WHEN ADAM CAME IN SIGHT OF THE GREY TOWN ON THE HILL SIDE AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY TOWARDS THE GREEN VALLEY BELOW FOR THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE OLD THATCHED ROOF NEAR THE UGLY RED MILL THE SCENE LOOKED LESS HARSH IN THE SOFT
1963-142393-0033 OCTOBER SUNSHINE THAN IT HAD IN THE EAGER TIME OF EARLY SPRING AND THE ONE GRAND CHARM IT POSSESSED IN COMMON WITH ALL WIDE STRETCHING WOODLESS REGIONS
1963-142393-0034 THAT IT FILLED YOU WITH A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE OVERARCHING SKY HAD A MILDER MORE SOOTHING INFLUENCE THAN USUAL ON THIS ALMOST CLOUDLESS DAY ADAM'S DOUBTS AND FEARS MELTED UNDER THIS INFLUENCE
1963-142393-0035 AS THE DELICATE WEBLIKE CLOUDS HAD GRADUALLY MELTED AWAY INTO THE CLEAR BLUE ABOVE HIM HE SEEMED TO SEE DINAH'S GENTLE FACE ASSURING HIM WITH ITS LOOKS ALONE OF ALL HE LONGED TO KNOW
1963-142393-0036 HE DID NOT EXPECT DINAH TO BE AT HOME AT THIS HOUR BUT HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND TIED IT AT THE LITTLE GATE
1963-142393-0037 HE HAD SET HIS MIND ON FOLLOWING HER AND BRINGING HER HOME SHE WAS GONE TO SLOMAN'S END A HAMLET ABOUT THREE MILES OFF OVER THE HILL THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM
1963-142393-0038 TO PREACH IN A COTTAGE THERE AS HER HABIT WAS
1963-142393-0039 SO ADAM GOT ON HIS HORSE AGAIN AND RODE TO THE TOWN PUTTING UP AT THE OLD INN AND TAKING A HASTY DINNER THERE IN THE COMPANY OF THE TOO CHATTY LANDLORD FROM WHOSE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS AND REMINISCENCES
1963-142393-0040 HE WAS GLAD TO ESCAPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SET OUT TOWARDS SLOMAN'S END WITH ALL HIS HASTE IT WAS NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK BEFORE HE COULD SET OFF
1963-142393-0041 THE LITTLE GREY DESOLATE LOOKING HAMLET UNSCREENED BY SHELTERING TREES LAY IN SIGHT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED IT AND AS HE CAME NEAR HE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF VOICES SINGING A HYMN
1963-142393-0042 PERHAPS THAT'S THE LAST HYMN BEFORE THEY COME AWAY ADAM THOUGHT I'LL WALK BACK A BIT AND TURN AGAIN TO MEET HER FARTHER OFF THE VILLAGE HE WALKED BACK TILL HE GOT NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AGAIN
1963-142393-0043 AND SEATED HIMSELF ON A LOOSE STONE AGAINST THE LOW WALL TO WATCH TILL HE SHOULD SEE THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE LEAVING THE HAMLET AND WINDING UP THE HILL HE CHOSE THIS SPOT ALMOST AT THE TOP OF THE HILL
1963-142393-0044 BECAUSE IT WAS AWAY FROM ALL EYES NO HOUSE NO CATTLE NOT EVEN A NIBBLING SHEEP NEAR NO PRESENCE BUT THE STILL LIGHTS AND SHADOWS AND THE GREAT EMBRACING SKY
1963-142393-0045 SHE WAS MUCH LONGER COMING THAN HE EXPECTED HE WAITED AN HOUR AT LEAST WATCHING FOR HER AND THINKING OF HER WHILE THE AFTERNOON SHADOWS LENGTHENED AND THE LIGHT GREW SOFTER AT LAST HE SAW THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE
1963-142393-0046 COMING FROM BETWEEN THE GREY HOUSES AND GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE FOOT OF THE HILL SLOWLY ADAM THOUGHT BUT DINAH WAS REALLY WALKING AT HER USUAL PACE WITH A LIGHT QUIET STEP
1963-142393-0047 NOW SHE WAS BEGINNING TO WIND ALONG THE PATH UP THE HILL BUT ADAM WOULD NOT MOVE YET HE WOULD NOT MEET HER TOO SOON HE HAD SET HIS HEART ON MEETING HER IN THIS ASSURED LONELINESS AND NOW HE BEGAN TO FEAR
1963-142393-0048 LEST HE SHOULD STARTLE HER TOO MUCH YET HE THOUGHT SHE'S NOT ONE TO BE OVERSTARTLED SHE'S ALWAYS SO CALM AND QUIET AS IF SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING WHAT WAS SHE THINKING OF AS SHE WOUND UP THE HILL
1963-142393-0049 PERHAPS SHE HAD FOUND COMPLETE REPOSE WITHOUT HIM AND HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANY NEED OF HIS LOVE ON THE VERGE OF A DECISION WE ALL TREMBLE HOPE PAUSES WITH FLUTTERING WINGS BUT NOW AT LAST SHE WAS VERY NEAR
1963-142393-0050 AND ADAM ROSE FROM THE STONE WALL IT HAPPENED THAT JUST AS HE WALKED FORWARD DINAH HAD PAUSED AND TURNED ROUND TO LOOK BACK AT THE VILLAGE
1963-142393-0051 ADAM WAS GLAD FOR WITH THE FINE INSTINCT OF A LOVER HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR HER TO HEAR HIS VOICE BEFORE SHE SAW HIM HE CAME WITHIN THREE PACES OF HER AND THEN SAID DINAH
1963-142393-0052 SHE STARTED WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND AS IF SHE CONNECTED THE SOUND WITH NO PLACE DINAH ADAM SAID AGAIN
1963-142393-0053 WHAT WAS IN HER MIND SHE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THINK OF IMPRESSIONS AS PURELY SPIRITUAL MONITIONS THAT SHE LOOKED FOR NO MATERIAL VISIBLE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE VOICE BUT THIS SECOND TIME SHE LOOKED ROUND
1963-142393-0054 WHAT A LOOK OF YEARNING LOVE IT WAS THAT THE MILD GREY EYES TURNED ON THE STRONG DARK EYED MAN SHE DID NOT START AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE SAID NOTHING BUT MOVED TOWARDS HIM SO THAT HIS ARM COULD CLASP HER ROUND
1963-142393-0055 AND THEY WALKED ON SO IN SILENCE WHILE THE WARM TEARS FELL ADAM WAS CONTENT AND SAID NOTHING IT WAS DINAH WHO SPOKE FIRST ADAM SHE SAID IT IS THE DIVINE WILL
1963-142393-0056 MY SOUL IS SO KNIT TO YOURS THAT IT IS BUT A DIVIDED LIFE I LIVE WITHOUT YOU AND THIS MOMENT NOW YOU ARE WITH ME AND I FEEL THAT OUR HEARTS ARE FILLED WITH THE SAME LOVE I HAVE A FULNESS OF STRENGTH
1963-142393-0057 TO BEAR AND DO OUR HEAVENLY FATHER'S WILL THAT I HAD LOST BEFORE ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED INTO HER SINCERE EYES THEN WE'LL NEVER PART ANY MORE DINAH TILL DEATH PARTS US AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER
