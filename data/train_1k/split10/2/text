1841-150351-0000 THE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE THE EXPLORERS AND EARLY SETTLERS FOUND A NATIVE RACE OCCUPYING NEARLY EVERY PORTION OF OUR CONTINENT THESE PEOPLE HAD MANY CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON AND WERE ALL CALLED INDIANS
1841-150351-0001 IN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE SURFACE IS BROKEN BY NUMEROUS BARRIERS SUCH AS MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS ALMOST EVERY VALLEY WAS FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY A DISTINCT GROUP OF INDIANS CALLED A TRIBE
1841-150351-0002 THE LANGUAGE OF EACH TRIBE DIFFERED SO MUCH FROM THE LANGUAGES OF ADJOINING TRIBES THAT THEY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER THESE TRIBES WERE ALMOST CONTINUALLY AT WAR
1841-150351-0003 THE INDIANS UPON THE PACIFIC SLOPE WERE GENERALLY FOUND TO BE INFERIOR IN MOST RESPECTS TO THOSE LIVING IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CONTINENT ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT THE TRIBES POSSESSING THE FAIR AND FERTILE VALLEYS OF CALIFORNIA
1841-150351-0004 WOULD BE THE MOST ADVANCED IN CIVILIZATION BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE MANY OF THEM WERE AMONG THE MOST DEGRADED UPON THE CONTINENT THEY SEEMED UNABLE TO ADAPT THEMSELVES TO THE WHITE MAN AND HIS WAYS
1841-150351-0005 AND IN THE OLDER SETTLED DISTRICTS THEY HAVE NOW NEARLY DISAPPEARED IN THE NEWER PORTIONS OF THE NORTHWEST AND ALONG THE COAST TOWARD ALASKA THE INDIANS HAVE NOT YET COME INTO SO DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE WHITE MEN
1841-150351-0006 THEY DID NOT CULTIVATE THE SOIL NOR DID THEY HUNT A GREAT DEAL ALTHOUGH THE COUNTRY ABOUNDED WITH GAME
1841-150351-0007 THESE INDIANS HAVE OFTEN BEEN CALLED DIGGERS BECAUSE THEY DEPENDED SO LARGELY FOR THEIR LIVING UPON THE ROOTS WHICH THEY DUG IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL THAT ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO BAY THE NATIVES SHOULD HAVE USED CANOES
1841-150351-0008 BUT ACCORDING TO EARLY TRAVELLERS THEY HAD NONE WHEN THEY WISHED TO GO OUT UPON THE WATER THEY BUILT RAFTS OF BUNDLES OF RUSHES OR TULES TIED TOGETHER AT FAVORABLE POINTS ALONG THE SHORE THE INDIANS COLLECTED FOR THEIR FEASTS
1841-150351-0009 AND THESE SPOTS ARE NOW INDICATED BY HEAPS OF SHELLS IN SOME PLACES FORMING MOUNDS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE
1841-150351-0010 IN THE MOUNTAINS THE SITES OF THE VILLAGES ARE MARKED BY CHIPS OF OBSIDIAN A VOLCANIC GLASS USED IN MAKING ARROW TIPS AND BY HOLES IN THE FLAT SURFACES OF GRANITIC ROCKS NEAR SOME SPRING OR STREAM
1841-150351-0011 THESE HOLES WERE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GRINDING ACORNS OR NUTS MANY OF THE INDIAN TRIBES DEVELOPED GREAT SKILL IN THE WEAVING OF BASKETS WHICH THEY USED FOR MANY DIFFERENT PURPOSES
1841-150351-0012 THE BASKETS ARE STILL MADE IN SOME PLACES AND ARE MUCH SOUGHT AFTER BECAUSE OF THEIR BEAUTY THE INDIANS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN BUILDING THEIR HOMES DUG ROUND SHALLOW HOLES OVER WHICH POLES WERE BENT IN THE FORM OF A HALF CIRCLE
1841-150351-0013 AND AFTER HE HAD ENTERED AND ALL OPENINGS WERE CLOSED HE POURED WATER UPON THE STONES UNTIL THE ROOM WAS FILLED WITH STEAM AFTER ENDURING THIS PROCESS AS LONG AS HE DESIRED THE INDIAN CAME OUT AND PLUNGED INTO THE COLD WATER OF A NEAR BY STREAM
1841-150351-0014 AS MAY BE IMAGINED SUCH A BATH OFTEN RESULTED DISASTROUSLY TO THE WEAK OR SICK THE FACT THAT THE CALIFORNIA INDIANS COULD SUPPORT THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY GREAT EXERTION
1841-150351-0015 AT CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHEN SALMON WERE PLENTIFUL EACH TRIBE OR GROUP OF INDIANS ESTABLISHED ITS CAMP NEAR ONE OF THE MANY RAPIDS AND WATERFALLS ALONG THE COLUMBIA RIVER LARGE NUMBERS OF THE SALMON WERE CAUGHT BY THE USE OF TRAPS
1841-150351-0016 AFTER BEING PARTLY DRIED THEY WERE PACKED IN BALES FOR WINTER USE THE FISH THUS PREPARED WERE CONSIDERED VERY VALUABLE AND FORMED AN ARTICLE OF TRADE WITH THE TRIBES LIVING FARTHER FROM THE RIVER
1841-150351-0017 BUT THIS ENTHUSIASM QUICKLY DISAPPEARS IF A HEAD WIND COMES UP AND THE PARTY GOES ASHORE TO WAIT FOR THE BREEZE TO TURN IN A MORE FAVORABLE DIRECTION THESE INDIANS AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED LIVE LARGELY UPON FISH
1841-150351-0018 BERRIES ARE ABUNDANT DURING THE SUMMER AND ARE ALSO MUCH USED FOR FOOD THE CLOTHING OF THE INDIANS WAS ORIGINALLY A SORT OF BLANKET MADE OF THE WOVEN FIBRES OF CEDAR BARK OR MORE RARELY OF THE SKINS OF ANIMALS
1841-150351-0019 AND LEAVING IT THERE WHILE THE HEAD IS GROWING
1841-150351-0020 THE BUILDINGS ARE STRUNG ALONG THE SHORE CLOSE UNDER THE EDGE OF THE THICK FOREST AND JUST ABOVE THE REACH OF THE WAVES AT HIGH TIDE THEY ARE VERY SOLIDLY CONSTRUCTED
1841-150351-0021 FOR THESE INDIANS DO NOT MOVE ABOUT AS MUCH AS THOSE FARTHER SOUTH WHERE THE FORESTS ARE LESS DENSE FIGURE SIXTY FIVE SHOWS THE FRAMEWORK OF A PARTIALLY BUILT HOUSE WHILE ANOTHER STANDS AT ONE SIDE COMPLETED
1841-150351-0022 LARGE POSTS ARE SET IN THE GROUND AT THE CORNERS AND ENDS OF THE BUILDING CROSS LOGS ARE THEN PLACED UPON THE MIDDLE POSTS
1841-150351-0023 THIS IS SOMETIMES TWO FEET IN DIAMETER AND FROM SIXTY TO EIGHTY FEET LONG IT MUST REQUIRE THE UNITED STRENGTH OF MANY MEN TO ROLL SUCH A LOG INTO POSITION UPON THE FRAMEWORK THUS CONSTRUCTED SPLIT CEDAR BOARDS ARE FASTENED
1841-150351-0024 AND THE BUILDING IS PRACTICALLY FINISHED SUCH A HOUSE IS USUALLY OCCUPIED BY A NUMBER OF FAMILIES UPON QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS THERE IS A DWELLING OF THIS KIND LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD SEVEN HUNDRED INDIANS
1841-150351-0025 THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES ARE ORNAMENTED WITH FIGURES HEWN OUT OF WOOD THESE REPRESENT MEN BIRDS AND ANIMALS AND HAVE A RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE SOMETIMES THESE FIGURES ARE MOUNTED UPON THE TOPS OF TALL POLES
1841-150351-0026 THE TOTEM POLE IS A MOST INTERESTING AFFAIR FIGURE SIXTY SIX REPRESENTS THE POLE AT ALERT BAY EAST OF VANCOUVER ISLAND IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST UPON THE NORTH COAST
1841-150351-0027 THE FIGURES OF ANIMALS AND BIRDS CARVED UPON IT REPRESENT THE MYTHOLOGICAL ANCESTORS OF THE FAMILY OR CLAN IN FRONT OF WHOSE ABODE THE POLE STANDS THE INDIANS OFTEN HUNT SIMILAR ANIMALS TO DAY
1841-150351-0028 BUT BELIEVE THAT THEIR ANCESTORS HAD SUPERNATURAL POWER WHICH RAISED THEM ABOVE THE ORDINARY CREATURES THE CHINOOK INDIANS LIVE UPON THE LOWER COLUMBIA
1841-150351-0029 THE NAME CHINOOK HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A WARM DRY WIND WHICH BLOWS DOWN THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND OUT UPON THE GREAT PLAINS THIS WIND IS SO NAMED BECAUSE IT BLOWS FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE CHINOOK INDIANS COUNTRY
1841-150351-0030 THE CHINOOK JARGON IS A STRANGE SORT OF MIXED LANGUAGE WITH WHICH NEARLY ALL THE TRIBES OF THE NORTHWEST ARE FAMILIAR IT IS FORMED OF WORDS FROM THE CHINOOK LANGUAGE TOGETHER WITH OTHERS FROM DIFFERENT INDIAN LANGUAGES
1841-150351-0031 IT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THESE AMERICAN INDIANS ORIGINALLY CAME ACROSS THE NARROW STRIP OF WATER SEPARATING ASIA FROM AMERICA WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THE INDIANS HAVE OCCUPIED OUR COUNTRY
1841-150351-0032 BUT IT HAS PROBABLY BEEN SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS SOME OF THE MAIN GROUPS HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN HERE LONGER THAN OTHERS
1841-159771-0000 THERE'S NO SENSE IN WASTING OUR TIME HERE SAID SOLOMON OWL TO HIS SMALL COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER IT'S A FINE NIGHT THE MICE WILL ALL BE OUT SOONER OR LATER LET'S GO OVER AND SIT IN THAT OLD OAK ON THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW
1841-159771-0001 SIMON SCREECHER WAS MORE THAN WILLING AND THEY HAD NO SOONER SETTLED THEMSELVES AMONG THE BARE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHEN SIMON STARTED TO AMUSE HIMSELF BY GIVING HIS WELL KNOWN QUAVERING WHISTLE SOLOMON OWL STOPPED HIM QUICKLY
1841-159771-0002 DON'T DO THAT HE SAID SHARPLY DO YOU WANT TO SCARE THE MICE SIMON SCREECHER CUT HIS WHISTLE OFF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT I FORGOT HE MURMURED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE MY WHISTLING WOULD DO ANY HARM
1841-159771-0003 I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY MICE LEFT ON FARMER GREEN'S PLACE IT'S MY OPINION THAT THEY'VE MOVED AWAY MOST OF THEM OR MAYBE OLD ROUGH LEG THE HAWK HAS CAUGHT MORE THAN HIS SHARE
1841-159771-0004 SOLOMON OWL MADE NO REPLY HE WAS A PERSON OF FEW WORDS IF ANYBODY ASKED HIS OPINION HE WAS READY TO GIVE IT BUT HE SELDOM GAVE ANY UNSOUGHT ADVICE
1841-159771-0005 I'VE ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND SAID SIMON SCREECHER THAT I'D MOVE TO SOME OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD IF I KNEW WHERE THERE WAS GOOD MOUSING I'D MOVE TO MORROW WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING SOLOMON OWL STARTED EVER SO SLIGHTLY
1841-159771-0006 YOU MIGHT AS WELL SEND THEM A TELEGRAM SAYING THAT YOU'LL BE ON HAND TO MEET THEM AT EIGHT P M SIMON SCREECHER WAS SILENCED FOR THE TIME BEING AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE SOLOMON OWL GAVE ANOTHER START THERE'S THAT SQUEAK AGAIN HE WHISPERED
1841-159771-0007 I BELIEVE IT IS GETTING NEARER TOO NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HAD A TUNNEL THAT LED RIGHT BENEATH THE TREE WHERE THE TWO COUSINS WERE SITTING
1841-159771-0008 AND HE HAD STROLLED THAT WAY AFTER SCURRYING UNDER THE SNOW WHEN HE HEARD SOLOMON OWL LAUGHING IN THE WOODS EARLIER IN THE EVENING IT WAS HE THAT SOLOMON HEARD IT WAS HE THAT STUCK HIS HEAD OUT OF A HOLE IN THE SNOW AND PEEPED UP AT THE STAR SPRINKLED SKY
1841-159771-0009 HE MUST HAVE HURRIED OVER HERE FROM THE WOODS HE MUST BE VERY HUNGRY AS SOLOMON OWL RETURNED TO THE OLD OAK HIS COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER LAUGHED SOMEWHAT UNPLEASANTLY MISSED HIM DIDN'T YOU HE INQUIRED YES
1841-159771-0010 WHY DIDN'T YOU GRAB HIM OUT OF THE SNOW SIMON ASKED WHAT ARE YOUR CLAWS FOR WHAT'S YOUR BEAK FOR I COULDN'T DIG HIM OUT SOLOMON OWL REPLIED THE SNOW IS THREE FEET DEEP
1841-159771-0011 AND IT HAS SEVEN DIFFERENT CRUSTS ONE UNDER ANOTHER THIS IS A HARD WINTER SAID SIMON SCREECHER I WISH I'D GONE SOUTH LAST FALL I WONDER HOW THE MOUSING IS DOWN THERE
1841-159771-0012 EATING A TREE AS SIMON SCREECHER REMARKED TO HIS COUSIN SOLOMON OWL IT WAS A HARD WINTER THE SNOW WAS DEEP THE DAYS WERE COLD AND THE NIGHTS WERE COLDER AND WORST OF ALL FOOD BECAME SCARCE
1841-159771-0013 IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO EAT ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT THE FARM BUILDINGS WHICH FARMER GREEN HAD STUFFED FULL OF HAY AND GRAIN DURING THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN MANY OF THE FOREST FOLK STOLE DOWN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN AFTER NIGHTFALL
1841-159771-0014 AND VISITED THE FARMYARD IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A BITE OF SOMETHING OR OTHER EVEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BEGAN TO FIND IT HARDER AND HARDER TO GET ENOUGH SEEDS UNDER THE SNOW TO SATISFY HIS HUNGER
1841-159771-0015 HE HAD STORED AWAY A STOCK OF FOOD BUT IT HADN'T BEEN BIG ENOUGH AND THAT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE PROMISED HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT REPEAT IT ANOTHER TIME
1841-159771-0016 UNFORTUNATELY ALL THE PROMISES IN THE WORLD WOULDN'T GIVE HIM A SQUARE MEAL WHEN HE NEEDED ONE
1841-159771-0017 THIS IS MY FIRST WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE EXPLAINED I'M RUNNING SHORT OF FOOD AND I WISH YOU'D TELL ME WHAT TO DO IN SUCH A CASE THAT'S EASY HIS COUSIN ANSWERED GET MORE
1841-159771-0018 AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY FOR HE HAD IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO POOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE RAN AFTER HIM IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW HIS COUSIN THROUGH THE WINDING GALLERIES BENEATH THE SNOW
1841-159771-0019 SEVERAL TIMES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TOOK THE WRONG TURN AND HAD TO RETRACE HIS STEPS BUT AT LAST HE FOUND HIS BUSY COUSIN AGAIN YOU ADVISED ME TO GET MORE FOOD SAID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHERE TO GET IT
1841-159771-0020 IN THE ORCHARD HIS COUSIN CRIED AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY AGAIN I WISH HE'D WAIT A MINUTE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE GRUMBLED AS HE TORE AFTER HIS COUSIN ONCE MORE
1841-159771-0021 I DON'T FEEL LIKE RUNNING I HAVEN'T HAD A HEARTY MEAL FOR DAYS THE COUSIN SEEMED SURPRISED WHEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE OVERTOOK HIM WHAT THAT BUSY GENTLEMAN EXCLAIMED HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE ORCHARD AND BACK SO SOON NO
1841-159771-0022 HAVING SAID THOSE THREE WORDS HE DASHED OFF AGAIN EVEN FASTER THAN BEFORE TREES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ECHOED I CAN'T EAT TREES
1841-159771-0023 THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT MY COUSIN FORGOT TO EXPLAIN SO I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE TO RUN AFTER HIM AGAIN AND ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANT THE FOURTH TIME THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE FOUND HIS COUSIN HE TOOK NO CHANCES
1841-159771-0024 HE CAUGHT HIS COUSIN BY HIS TAIL AND HELD ON FIRMLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY FROM ME TILL I'VE FOUND OUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW HE DECLARED HOW CAN I EAT A TREE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE DEMANDED YOU CAN'T
1841-159771-0025 HIS COUSIN REPLIED STRUGGLING DESPERATELY TO FREE HIMSELF FOR HE WAS TOO BUSY TO STOP LONG THEN EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CRIED EAT THE BARK HIS COUSIN ANSWERED
1841-159771-0026 THEN AND NOT TILL THEN DID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE LET HIM GO MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CHASED HIS COUSIN NO MORE BUT HURRIED AWAY TO FARMER GREEN'S ORCHARD WHERE HE GNAWED A RING
1841-159771-0027 BUT FARMER GREEN DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM WHEN HE HAPPENED TO GO INTO THE ORCHARD ONE DAY LATER AND SAW TREE AFTER TREE RUINED HE WAS VERY VERY MUCH DISPLEASED
1841-159771-0028 I OUGHT TO HAVE PUT WIRE NETTING AROUND THOSE YOUNG TREES HE TOLD THE HIRED MAN THIS IS WHAT COMES OF A HARD WINTER
1841-159771-0029 A COLD DIP IN ONE WAY PETER MINK WAS LIKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HE ENJOYED SWIMMING AND HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF HIS TIME ALONG THE STREAMS THAT THREADED THEIR WAY THROUGH PLEASANT VALLEY SOMETIMES PETER DAWDLED ON THE BANKS OF SWIFT RIVER
1841-159771-0030 SOMETIMES HE LINGERED FOR DAYS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BLACK CREEK NOR DID HE DISDAIN SO SMALL A STREAM AS THE BROOK THAT CROSSED THE MEADOW IT WAS DEEP ENOUGH FOR A SWIM AND HE KNEW THAT MUSKRATS LIVED UNDER ITS BANKS
1841-159771-0031 WELL PETER MINK HAD SURPRISED MANY A ONE SWIMMING IN THE BROOK IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE MEADOW MICE PERHAPS HE WOULDN'T HAVE VISITED THE BROOK SO OFTEN EVEN IN WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE JUST HAD TO HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN
1841-159771-0032 JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS SKATING FOR JOHNNIE GREEN ON TOP OF THE BROOK IT MUSTN'T BE SUPPOSED THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE A SWIM WHEN HE WANTED ONE
1841-159771-0033 WHEN PETER MINK WANDERED ALONG A STREAM IN WINTER HE PREFERRED TO TRAVEL UNDER THE ICE RATHER THAN WALK UPON THE UPPER SIDE OF IT
1841-159771-0034 IT MADE LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO HIM WHETHER THERE WAS A DRY STRIP ALONG THE EDGE OF THE STREAM WHERE HE COULD STEAL SILENTLY ALONG WITHOUT WETTING HIS FEET WHEN HE FOUND NO PLACE TO WALK HE SWAM NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS TRICK OF PETER MINK'S
1841-159771-0035 THIS TRICK OF LURKING BENEATH THE ICE OF RIVER CREEK AND BROOK BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WOULD HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN DESPITE PETER MINK AND HIS PROWLING WAYS TO BE SURE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TRIED TO BE CAREFUL
1841-159771-0036 BEFORE HE CREPT FROM THE END OF HIS TUNNEL HE STUCK HIS HEAD OUT AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN AND ALL AROUND HE PEEPED UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK HE EVEN STARED INTO THE WATER AND THEN IF HE SAW NOBODY THAT WAS FIERCER THAN PADDY MUSKRAT
1841-159771-0037 ONLY THEN WOULD HE VENTURE TO SKIP TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND PLUNGE IN TO TELL THE TRUTH MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS FELT SAFER WHEN ONE OF THE MUSKRAT FAMILY HAPPENED TO BE TAKING A SWIM AT THE SAME TIME
1841-159771-0038 FOR THE MUSKRATS ALL HAD A WARNING SIGNAL THAT TOLD EVERYBODY WHEN THERE WAS DANGER WHEN ONE OF THEM CAUGHT SIGHT OF PETER MINK HE NEVER FAILED IF HE WAS IN THE WATER TO GIVE A LOUD SLAP UPON THE SURFACE WITH HIS TAIL
1841-159771-0039 MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS HAD ONE EAR THAT WAS LISTENING FOR THAT SLAP AND WHEN IT SOUNDED HE NEVER WAITED AN INSTANT BUT DARTED INTO HIS TUNNEL WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING TO SHAKE THE WATER OFF HIS COAT
1841-159771-0040 HE SAID THAT HE COULD DRY HIS COAT AFTER HE REACHED HOME WHILE IF HE STOPPED TO DRY IT AT THE EDGE OF THE BROOK PERHAPS HE'D NEVER GET HOME AT ALL YOU MIGHT THINK THAT NOW AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF
1841-159771-0041 OH I WON'T BOTHER TO LOOK FOR PETER MINK TO DAY HE MUST BE MILES AWAY I'LL STEP RIGHT OUT OF MY TUNNEL AND HAVE MY SWIM WITHOUT TAKING A LOOK SEE FIRST BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS NEVER SO LAZY AS THAT
1841-159771-0042 AND THE DAY CAME AT LAST WHEN IT WAS WELL WORTH HIS WHILE TO TAKE THE LITTLE EXTRA TROUBLE OF PEEPING OUT BEFORE HE HAD HIS SWIM FOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A SNAKELIKE HEAD THAT DARTED OUT FROM UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK AND DARTED BACK AGAIN OUT OF SIGHT
1841-179183-0000 AND HIS TONGUE GAVE MY HAND A LICK HE PRESSED CLOSE TO ME AS IF HE WERE FAIN TO CROWD HIMSELF INTO MY HAND HE LOVED IT WITH HIS TAIL WITH HIS PAW WITH HIS TONGUE IF HE COULD SPEAK I BELIEVE HE WOULD SAY WITH ME
1841-179183-0001 THAT PARADISE IS ATTAINED BY TOUCH FOR IN TOUCH IS ALL LOVE AND INTELLIGENCE THIS SMALL INCIDENT STARTED ME ON A CHAT ABOUT HANDS AND IF MY CHAT IS FORTUNATE I HAVE TO THANK MY DOG STAR
1841-179183-0002 IN ANY CASE IT IS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS MONOPOLIZED IT IS LIKE MAKING A NEW PATH IN THE TRACKLESS WOODS BLAZING THE TRAIL WHERE NO FOOT HAS PRESSED BEFORE
1841-179183-0003 I AM GLAD TO TAKE YOU BY THE HAND AND LEAD YOU ALONG AN UNTRODDEN WAY INTO A WORLD WHERE THE HAND IS SUPREME BUT AT THE VERY OUTSET WE ENCOUNTER A DIFFICULTY YOU ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO LIGHT
1841-179183-0004 I PROMISE THAT YOU SHALL NOT BE LED INTO FIRE OR WATER OR FALL INTO A DEEP PIT IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME PATIENTLY YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE'S A SOUND SO FINE NOTHING LIVES TWIXT IT AND SILENCE
1841-179183-0005 AND THAT THERE IS MORE MEANT IN THINGS THAN MEETS THE EYE MY HAND IS TO ME WHAT YOUR HEARING AND SIGHT TOGETHER ARE TO YOU IN LARGE MEASURE WE TRAVEL THE SAME HIGHWAYS READ THE SAME BOOKS SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE
1841-179183-0006 A SLIGHT FLUTTER OF THE FINGERS BEGAN THE INTELLIGENCE THE JOY THE FULLNESS OF MY LIFE LIKE JOB I FEEL AS IF A HAND HAD MADE ME FASHIONED ME TOGETHER ROUND ABOUT AND MOULDED MY VERY SOUL
1841-179183-0007 IN ALL MY EXPERIENCES AND THOUGHTS I AM CONSCIOUS OF A HAND WHATEVER MOVES ME WHATEVER THRILLS ME IS AS A HAND THAT TOUCHES ME IN THE DARK AND THAT TOUCH IS MY REALITY YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT A SIGHT WHICH MAKES YOU GLAD
1841-179183-0008 ALL THESE AND A THOUSAND RESULTANT COMBINATIONS WHICH TAKE SHAPE IN MY MIND CONSTITUTE MY WORLD IDEAS MAKE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN AND IMPRESSIONS FURNISH IDEAS MY WORLD IS BUILT OF TOUCH SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0009 BUT WITHOUT COLOUR AND SOUND IT BREATHES AND THROBS WITH LIFE
1841-179183-0010 OF BEAUTY OR OF INCONGRUITY FOR WITH MY HANDS I CAN FEEL THE COMIC AS WELL AS THE BEAUTIFUL IN THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THINGS REMEMBER THAT YOU DEPENDENT ON YOUR SIGHT DO NOT REALIZE HOW MANY THINGS ARE TANGIBLE
1841-179183-0011 ALL PALPABLE THINGS ARE MOBILE OR RIGID SOLID OR LIQUID BIG OR SMALL WARM OR COLD AND THESE QUALITIES ARE VARIOUSLY MODIFIED
1841-179183-0012 THE COOLNESS OF A WATER LILY ROUNDING INTO BLOOM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE COOLNESS OF AN EVENING WIND IN SUMMER AND DIFFERENT AGAIN FROM THE COOLNESS OF THE RAIN THAT SOAKS INTO THE HEARTS OF GROWING THINGS AND GIVES THEM LIFE AND BODY
1841-179183-0013 THE VELVET OF THE ROSE IS NOT THAT OF A RIPE PEACH OR OF A BABY'S DIMPLED CHEEK THE HARDNESS OF THE ROCK IS TO THE HARDNESS OF WOOD WHAT A MAN'S DEEP BASS IS TO A WOMAN'S VOICE WHEN IT IS LOW
1841-179183-0014 WHAT I CALL BEAUTY I FIND IN CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF ALL THESE QUALITIES AND IS LARGELY DERIVED FROM THE FLOW OF CURVED AND STRAIGHT LINES WHICH IS OVER ALL THINGS WHAT DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE MEAN TO YOU
1841-179183-0015 IT MEANS SEVERAL THINGS IT SYMBOLIZES DUTY IT SEEMS TO HAVE THE QUALITY OF INEXORABLENESS THAT DUTY HAS WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO THAT MUST NOT BE SET ASIDE I FEEL AS IF I WERE GOING FORWARD IN A STRAIGHT LINE
1841-179183-0016 OR GO ON FOREVER WITHOUT SWERVING TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO ESCAPE THIS MORALIZING YOU SHOULD ASK HOW DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE FEEL IT FEELS AS I SUPPOSE IT LOOKS STRAIGHT
1841-179183-0017 NOW BROKEN OFF OR LENGTHENED OR SWELLING THEY RISE AND SINK BENEATH MY FINGERS THEY ARE FULL OF SUDDEN STARTS AND PAUSES AND THEIR VARIETY IS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND WONDERFUL SO YOU SEE I AM NOT SHUT OUT FROM THE REGION OF THE BEAUTIFUL
1841-179183-0018 THOUGH MY HAND CANNOT PERCEIVE THE BRILLIANT COLOURS IN THE SUNSET OR ON THE MOUNTAIN OR REACH INTO THE BLUE DEPTHS OF THE SKY PHYSICS TELLS ME THAT I AM WELL OFF IN A WORLD WHICH I AM TOLD KNOWS NEITHER COLD NOR SOUND
1841-179183-0019 FOR AT LEAST EVERY OBJECT APPEARS TO MY FINGERS STANDING SOLIDLY RIGHT SIDE UP AND IS NOT AN INVERTED IMAGE ON THE RETINA WHICH I UNDERSTAND YOUR BRAIN IS AT INFINITE THOUGH UNCONSCIOUS LABOUR TO SET BACK ON ITS FEET
1841-179183-0020 A TANGIBLE OBJECT PASSES COMPLETE INTO MY BRAIN WITH THE WARMTH OF LIFE UPON IT AND OCCUPIES THE SAME PLACE THAT IT DOES IN SPACE FOR WITHOUT EGOTISM THE MIND IS AS LARGE AS THE UNIVERSE
1841-179183-0021 WHEN I THINK OF HILLS I THINK OF THE UPWARD STRENGTH I TREAD UPON WHEN WATER IS THE OBJECT OF MY THOUGHT I FEEL THE COOL SHOCK OF THE PLUNGE AND THE QUICK YIELDING OF THE WAVES THAT CRISP AND CURL AND RIPPLE ABOUT MY BODY
1841-179183-0022 THE PLEASING CHANGES OF ROUGH AND SMOOTH PLIANT AND RIGID CURVED AND STRAIGHT IN THE BARK AND BRANCHES OF A TREE GIVE THE TRUTH TO MY HAND THE IMMOVABLE ROCK WITH ITS JUTS AND WARPED SURFACE
1841-179183-0023 A BIRD IN MY HAND WAS THEN WORTH TWO IN THE BARNYARD MY FINGERS CANNOT OF COURSE GET THE IMPRESSION OF A LARGE WHOLE AT A GLANCE BUT I FEEL THE PARTS AND MY MIND PUTS THEM TOGETHER
1841-179183-0024 I MOVE AROUND MY HOUSE TOUCHING OBJECT AFTER OBJECT IN ORDER BEFORE I CAN FORM AN IDEA OF THE ENTIRE HOUSE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES I CAN TOUCH ONLY WHAT IS SHOWN TO ME THE CHIEF OBJECTS OF INTEREST
1841-179183-0025 CARVINGS ON THE WALL OR A CURIOUS ARCHITECTURAL FEATURE EXHIBITED LIKE THE FAMILY ALBUM THEREFORE A HOUSE WITH WHICH I AM NOT FAMILIAR HAS FOR ME AT FIRST NO GENERAL EFFECT OR HARMONY OF DETAIL
1841-179183-0026 IT IS NOT A COMPLETE CONCEPTION BUT A COLLECTION OF OBJECT IMPRESSIONS WHICH AS THEY COME TO ME ARE DISCONNECTED AND ISOLATED BUT MY MIND IS FULL OF ASSOCIATIONS SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0027 THEORIES AND WITH THEM IT CONSTRUCTS THE HOUSE THE PROCESS REMINDS ME OF THE BUILDING OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE
1841-179183-0028 THE SILENT WORKER IS IMAGINATION WHICH DECREES REALITY OUT OF CHAOS WITHOUT IMAGINATION WHAT A POOR THING MY WORLD WOULD BE
1841-179183-0029 MY GARDEN WOULD BE A SILENT PATCH OF EARTH STREWN WITH STICKS OF A VARIETY OF SHAPES AND SMELLS BUT WHEN THE EYE OF MY MIND IS OPENED TO ITS BEAUTY THE BARE GROUND BRIGHTENS BENEATH MY FEET AND THE HEDGE ROW BURSTS INTO LEAF
1841-179183-0030 AND THE ROSE TREE SHAKES ITS FRAGRANCE EVERYWHERE I KNOW HOW BUDDING TREES LOOK AND I ENTER INTO THE AMOROUS JOY OF THE MATING BIRDS AND THIS IS THE MIRACLE OF IMAGINATION
1841-179183-0031 WHICH HE HAS EMBODIED IN A SCULPTURED FORM ALTHOUGH COMPARED WITH THE LIFE WARM MOBILE FACE OF A FRIEND THE MARBLE IS COLD AND PULSELESS AND UNRESPONSIVE YET IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO MY HAND
1841-179183-0032 ITS FLOWING CURVES AND BENDINGS ARE A REAL PLEASURE ONLY BREATH IS WANTING BUT UNDER THE SPELL OF THE IMAGINATION THE MARBLE THRILLS AND BECOMES THE DIVINE REALITY OF THE IDEAL IMAGINATION PUTS A SENTIMENT INTO EVERY LINE AND CURVE
1841-179183-0033 AND THE STATUE IN MY TOUCH IS INDEED THE GODDESS HERSELF WHO BREATHES AND MOVES AND ENCHANTS IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT SOME SCULPTURES EVEN RECOGNIZED MASTERPIECES DO NOT PLEASE MY HAND
1841-179183-0034 WHEN I TOUCH WHAT THERE IS OF THE WINGED VICTORY IT REMINDS ME AT FIRST OF A HEADLESS LIMBLESS DREAM THAT FLIES TOWARDS ME IN AN UNRESTFUL SLEEP
1841-179183-0035 THE GARMENTS OF THE VICTORY THRUST STIFFLY OUT BEHIND AND DO NOT RESEMBLE GARMENTS THAT I HAVE FELT FLYING FLUTTERING FOLDING SPREADING IN THE WIND
1841-179183-0036 BUT IMAGINATION FULFILS THESE IMPERFECTIONS AND STRAIGHTWAY THE VICTORY BECOMES A POWERFUL AND SPIRITED FIGURE WITH THE SWEEP OF SEA WINDS IN HER ROBES AND THE SPLENDOUR OF CONQUEST IN HER WINGS
1841-179183-0037 AND I LIKE THE LUXURIANT WAVY HAIR OF BACCHUS AND APOLLO AND THE WREATH OF IVY SO SUGGESTIVE OF PAGAN HOLIDAYS SO IMAGINATION CROWNS THE EXPERIENCE OF MY HANDS
1841-179183-0038 AND THEY LEARNED THEIR CUNNING FROM THE WISE HAND OF ANOTHER WHICH ITSELF GUIDED BY IMAGINATION LED ME SAFELY IN PATHS THAT I KNEW NOT
