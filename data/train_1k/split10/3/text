1963-142393-0000 ADAM UNDERSTOOD DINAH'S HASTE TO GO AWAY AND DREW HOPE RATHER THAN DISCOURAGEMENT FROM IT
1963-142393-0001 I WISH I'D ASKED HER TO WRITE TO ME THOUGH HE THOUGHT AND YET
1963-142393-0002 SHE WANTS TO BE QUITE QUIET IN HER OLD WAY FOR A WHILE AND I'VE NO RIGHT TO BE IMPATIENT AND INTERRUPTING HER WITH MY WISHES SHE'S TOLD ME WHAT HER MIND IS AND SHE'S NOT A WOMAN TO SAY ONE THING AND MEAN ANOTHER
1963-142393-0003 I'LL WAIT PATIENTLY THAT WAS ADAM'S WISE RESOLUTION AND IT THROVE EXCELLENTLY FOR THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WEEKS ON THE NOURISHMENT IT GOT
1963-142393-0004 BUT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER THE RESOLUTION BEGAN TO DWINDLE PERCEPTIBLY AND SHOWED DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS OF EXHAUSTION THE WEEKS WERE UNUSUALLY LONG DINAH MUST SURELY HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE UP HER MIND
1963-142393-0005 HE IS A LITTLE TOO FLUSHED AND EXALTED WITH THAT FIRST DRAUGHT SHE OFFERS HIM TO CARE MUCH ABOUT THE TASTE OF THE SECOND HE TREADS THE EARTH WITH A VERY ELASTIC STEP AS HE WALKS AWAY FROM HER AND MAKES LIGHT OF ALL DIFFICULTIES
1963-142393-0006 BUT THAT SORT OF GLOW DIES OUT MEMORY GETS SADLY DILUTED WITH TIME AND IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REVIVE US ADAM WAS NO LONGER SO CONFIDENT AS HE HAD BEEN HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PERHAPS DINAH'S OLD LIFE
1963-142393-0007 WOULD HAVE TOO STRONG A GRASP UPON HER
1963-142393-0008 IF SHE HAD NOT FELT THIS SHE WOULD SURELY HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM TO GIVE HIM SOME COMFORT BUT IT APPEARED THAT SHE HELD IT RIGHT TO DISCOURAGE HIM AS ADAM'S CONFIDENCE WANED HIS PATIENCE WANED WITH IT
1963-142393-0009 AND HE THOUGHT HE MUST WRITE HIMSELF HE MUST ASK DINAH NOT TO LEAVE HIM IN PAINFUL DOUBT LONGER THAN WAS NEEDFUL HE SAT UP LATE ONE NIGHT TO WRITE HER A LETTER BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE BURNT IT AFRAID OF ITS EFFECT
1963-142393-0010 IT WOULD BE WORSE TO HAVE A DISCOURAGING ANSWER BY LETTER THAN FROM HER OWN LIPS FOR HER PRESENCE RECONCILED HIM TO HER WILL YOU PERCEIVE HOW IT WAS ADAM WAS HUNGERING FOR THE SIGHT OF DINAH
1963-142393-0011 AND WHEN THAT SORT OF HUNGER REACHES A CERTAIN STAGE A LOVER IS LIKELY TO STILL IT THOUGH HE MAY HAVE TO PUT HIS FUTURE IN PAWN BUT WHAT HARM COULD HE DO BY GOING TO SNOWFIELD DINAH COULD NOT BE DISPLEASED WITH HIM FOR IT
1963-142393-0012 SHE HAD NOT FORBIDDEN HIM TO GO SHE MUST SURELY EXPECT THAT HE WOULD GO BEFORE LONG BY THE SECOND SUNDAY IN OCTOBER
1963-142393-0013 THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO SNOWFIELD ON HORSEBACK THIS TIME FOR HIS HOURS WERE PRECIOUS NOW AND HE HAD BORROWED JONATHAN BURGE'S GOOD NAG FOR THE JOURNEY WHAT KEEN MEMORIES WENT ALONG THE ROAD WITH HIM
1963-142393-0014 HE HAD OFTEN BEEN TO OAKBOURNE AND BACK SINCE THAT FIRST JOURNEY TO SNOWFIELD BUT BEYOND OAKBOURNE THE GREYSTONE WALLS THE BROKEN COUNTRY THE MEAGRE TREES SEEMED TO BE TELLING HIM AFRESH
1963-142393-0015 THE STORY OF THAT PAINFUL PAST WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL BY HEART BUT NO STORY IS THE SAME TO US AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME OR RATHER WE WHO READ IT ARE NO LONGER THE SAME INTERPRETERS AND ADAM
1963-142393-0016 THIS MORNING BROUGHT WITH HIM NEW THOUGHTS THROUGH THAT GREY COUNTRY THOUGHTS WHICH GAVE AN ALTERED SIGNIFICANCE TO ITS STORY OF THE PAST THAT IS A BASE
1963-142393-0017 AND SELFISH EVEN A BLASPHEMOUS SPIRIT WHICH REJOICES AND IS THANKFUL OVER THE PAST EVIL THAT HAS BLIGHTED OR CRUSHED ANOTHER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MADE A SOURCE OF UNFORESEEN GOOD TO OURSELVES
1963-142393-0018 ADAM COULD NEVER CEASE TO MOURN OVER THAT MYSTERY OF HUMAN SORROW WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT SO CLOSE TO HIM HE COULD NEVER THANK GOD FOR ANOTHER'S MISERY AND IF I WERE CAPABLE OF THAT NARROW SIGHTED JOY IN ADAM'S BEHALF
1963-142393-0019 I SHOULD STILL KNOW HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO FEEL IT FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HIS HEAD AT SUCH A SENTIMENT AND SAID EVIL'S EVIL AND SORROW'S SORROW
1963-142393-0020 BY WRAPPING IT UP IN OTHER WORDS OTHER FOLKS WERE NOT CREATED FOR MY SAKE THAT I SHOULD THINK ALL SQUARE WHEN THINGS TURN OUT WELL FOR ME BUT IT IS NOT IGNOBLE TO FEEL THAT THE FULLER LIFE
1963-142393-0021 WHICH A SAD EXPERIENCE HAS BROUGHT US IS WORTH OUR OWN PERSONAL SHARE OF PAIN SURELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FEEL OTHERWISE ANY MORE THAN IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
1963-142393-0022 BY WHICH HIS DIM BLURRED SIGHT OF MEN AS TREES WALKING HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR CLEAR OUTLINE AND EFFULGENT DAY THE GROWTH OF HIGHER FEELING WITHIN US IS LIKE THE GROWTH OF FACULTY
1963-142393-0023 WE CAN NO MORE WISH TO RETURN TO A NARROWER SYMPATHY THAN A PAINTER OR A MUSICIAN CAN WISH TO RETURN TO HIS CRUDER MANNER OR A PHILOSOPHER TO HIS LESS COMPLETE FORMULA
1963-142393-0024 SOMETHING LIKE THIS SENSE OF ENLARGED BEING WAS IN ADAM'S MIND THIS SUNDAY MORNING AS HE RODE ALONG IN VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST
1963-142393-0025 THE HOPE OF PASSING HIS LIFE WITH HER HAD BEEN THE DISTANT UNSEEN POINT TOWARDS WHICH THAT HARD JOURNEY FROM SNOWFIELD EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN LEADING HIM TENDER AND DEEP AS HIS LOVE FOR HETTY HAD BEEN
1963-142393-0026 SO DEEP THAT THE ROOTS OF IT WOULD NEVER BE TORN AWAY HIS LOVE FOR DINAH WAS BETTER AND MORE PRECIOUS TO HIM FOR IT WAS THE OUTGROWTH OF THAT FULLER LIFE WHICH HAD COME TO HIM FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH DEEP SORROW
1963-142393-0027 IT'S LIKE AS IF IT WAS A NEW STRENGTH TO ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AND KNOW AS SHE LOVES ME
1963-142393-0028 FOR SHE'S BETTER THAN I AM
1963-142393-0029 AS IF YOU COULD WALK MORE FEARLESS WHEN YOU'VE MORE TRUST IN ANOTHER
1963-142393-0030 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THINKING I KNEW BETTER THAN THEM AS BELONGED TO ME
1963-142393-0031 WHEN YOU CAN'T LOOK TO THEM NEAREST TO YOU T HELP YOU WITH A BIT BETTER THOUGHT
1963-142393-0032 WHEN ADAM CAME IN SIGHT OF THE GREY TOWN ON THE HILL SIDE AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY TOWARDS THE GREEN VALLEY BELOW FOR THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE OLD THATCHED ROOF NEAR THE UGLY RED MILL THE SCENE LOOKED LESS HARSH IN THE SOFT
1963-142393-0033 OCTOBER SUNSHINE THAN IT HAD IN THE EAGER TIME OF EARLY SPRING AND THE ONE GRAND CHARM IT POSSESSED IN COMMON WITH ALL WIDE STRETCHING WOODLESS REGIONS
1963-142393-0034 THAT IT FILLED YOU WITH A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE OVERARCHING SKY HAD A MILDER MORE SOOTHING INFLUENCE THAN USUAL ON THIS ALMOST CLOUDLESS DAY ADAM'S DOUBTS AND FEARS MELTED UNDER THIS INFLUENCE
1963-142393-0035 AS THE DELICATE WEBLIKE CLOUDS HAD GRADUALLY MELTED AWAY INTO THE CLEAR BLUE ABOVE HIM HE SEEMED TO SEE DINAH'S GENTLE FACE ASSURING HIM WITH ITS LOOKS ALONE OF ALL HE LONGED TO KNOW
1963-142393-0036 HE DID NOT EXPECT DINAH TO BE AT HOME AT THIS HOUR BUT HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND TIED IT AT THE LITTLE GATE
1963-142393-0037 HE HAD SET HIS MIND ON FOLLOWING HER AND BRINGING HER HOME SHE WAS GONE TO SLOMAN'S END A HAMLET ABOUT THREE MILES OFF OVER THE HILL THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM
1963-142393-0038 TO PREACH IN A COTTAGE THERE AS HER HABIT WAS
1963-142393-0039 SO ADAM GOT ON HIS HORSE AGAIN AND RODE TO THE TOWN PUTTING UP AT THE OLD INN AND TAKING A HASTY DINNER THERE IN THE COMPANY OF THE TOO CHATTY LANDLORD FROM WHOSE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS AND REMINISCENCES
1963-142393-0040 HE WAS GLAD TO ESCAPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SET OUT TOWARDS SLOMAN'S END WITH ALL HIS HASTE IT WAS NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK BEFORE HE COULD SET OFF
1963-142393-0041 THE LITTLE GREY DESOLATE LOOKING HAMLET UNSCREENED BY SHELTERING TREES LAY IN SIGHT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED IT AND AS HE CAME NEAR HE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF VOICES SINGING A HYMN
1963-142393-0042 PERHAPS THAT'S THE LAST HYMN BEFORE THEY COME AWAY ADAM THOUGHT I'LL WALK BACK A BIT AND TURN AGAIN TO MEET HER FARTHER OFF THE VILLAGE HE WALKED BACK TILL HE GOT NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AGAIN
1963-142393-0043 AND SEATED HIMSELF ON A LOOSE STONE AGAINST THE LOW WALL TO WATCH TILL HE SHOULD SEE THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE LEAVING THE HAMLET AND WINDING UP THE HILL HE CHOSE THIS SPOT ALMOST AT THE TOP OF THE HILL
1963-142393-0044 BECAUSE IT WAS AWAY FROM ALL EYES NO HOUSE NO CATTLE NOT EVEN A NIBBLING SHEEP NEAR NO PRESENCE BUT THE STILL LIGHTS AND SHADOWS AND THE GREAT EMBRACING SKY
1963-142393-0045 SHE WAS MUCH LONGER COMING THAN HE EXPECTED HE WAITED AN HOUR AT LEAST WATCHING FOR HER AND THINKING OF HER WHILE THE AFTERNOON SHADOWS LENGTHENED AND THE LIGHT GREW SOFTER AT LAST HE SAW THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE
1963-142393-0046 COMING FROM BETWEEN THE GREY HOUSES AND GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE FOOT OF THE HILL SLOWLY ADAM THOUGHT BUT DINAH WAS REALLY WALKING AT HER USUAL PACE WITH A LIGHT QUIET STEP
1963-142393-0047 NOW SHE WAS BEGINNING TO WIND ALONG THE PATH UP THE HILL BUT ADAM WOULD NOT MOVE YET HE WOULD NOT MEET HER TOO SOON HE HAD SET HIS HEART ON MEETING HER IN THIS ASSURED LONELINESS AND NOW HE BEGAN TO FEAR
1963-142393-0048 LEST HE SHOULD STARTLE HER TOO MUCH YET HE THOUGHT SHE'S NOT ONE TO BE OVERSTARTLED SHE'S ALWAYS SO CALM AND QUIET AS IF SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING WHAT WAS SHE THINKING OF AS SHE WOUND UP THE HILL
1963-142393-0049 PERHAPS SHE HAD FOUND COMPLETE REPOSE WITHOUT HIM AND HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANY NEED OF HIS LOVE ON THE VERGE OF A DECISION WE ALL TREMBLE HOPE PAUSES WITH FLUTTERING WINGS BUT NOW AT LAST SHE WAS VERY NEAR
1963-142393-0050 AND ADAM ROSE FROM THE STONE WALL IT HAPPENED THAT JUST AS HE WALKED FORWARD DINAH HAD PAUSED AND TURNED ROUND TO LOOK BACK AT THE VILLAGE
1963-142393-0051 ADAM WAS GLAD FOR WITH THE FINE INSTINCT OF A LOVER HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR HER TO HEAR HIS VOICE BEFORE SHE SAW HIM HE CAME WITHIN THREE PACES OF HER AND THEN SAID DINAH
1963-142393-0052 SHE STARTED WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND AS IF SHE CONNECTED THE SOUND WITH NO PLACE DINAH ADAM SAID AGAIN
1963-142393-0053 WHAT WAS IN HER MIND SHE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THINK OF IMPRESSIONS AS PURELY SPIRITUAL MONITIONS THAT SHE LOOKED FOR NO MATERIAL VISIBLE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE VOICE BUT THIS SECOND TIME SHE LOOKED ROUND
1963-142393-0054 WHAT A LOOK OF YEARNING LOVE IT WAS THAT THE MILD GREY EYES TURNED ON THE STRONG DARK EYED MAN SHE DID NOT START AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE SAID NOTHING BUT MOVED TOWARDS HIM SO THAT HIS ARM COULD CLASP HER ROUND
1963-142393-0055 AND THEY WALKED ON SO IN SILENCE WHILE THE WARM TEARS FELL ADAM WAS CONTENT AND SAID NOTHING IT WAS DINAH WHO SPOKE FIRST ADAM SHE SAID IT IS THE DIVINE WILL
1963-142393-0056 MY SOUL IS SO KNIT TO YOURS THAT IT IS BUT A DIVIDED LIFE I LIVE WITHOUT YOU AND THIS MOMENT NOW YOU ARE WITH ME AND I FEEL THAT OUR HEARTS ARE FILLED WITH THE SAME LOVE I HAVE A FULNESS OF STRENGTH
1963-142393-0057 TO BEAR AND DO OUR HEAVENLY FATHER'S WILL THAT I HAD LOST BEFORE ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED INTO HER SINCERE EYES THEN WE'LL NEVER PART ANY MORE DINAH TILL DEATH PARTS US AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER
