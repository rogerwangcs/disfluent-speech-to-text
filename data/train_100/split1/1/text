1624-142933-0000 PETER SEES ROSEBREAST AND FINDS REDCOAT
1624-142933-0001 WHO'S THAT PETER RABBIT PRICKED UP HIS LONG EARS AND STARED UP AT THE TOPS OF THE TREES OF THE OLD ORCHARD INSTANTLY JENNY WREN POPPED HER HEAD OUT OF HER DOORWAY SHE COCKED HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE TO LISTEN
1624-142933-0002 THEN LOOKED DOWN AT PETER AND HER SHARP LITTLE EYES SNAPPED I DON'T HEAR ANY STRANGE VOICE SAID SHE THE WAY YOU ARE STARING PETER RABBIT ONE WOULD THINK THAT YOU HAD REALLY HEARD SOMETHING NEW AND WORTH WHILE
1624-142933-0003 JUST THEN THERE WERE TWO OR THREE RATHER SHARP SQUEAKY NOTES FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TREES THERE CRIED PETER THERE DIDN'T YOU HEAR THAT JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0004 FOR GOODNESS SAKE PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU DON'T KNOW WHOSE VOICE THAT IS SHE CRIED THAT'S ROSEBREAST HE AND MISSUS ROSEBREAST HAVE BEEN HERE FOR QUITE A LITTLE WHILE
1624-142933-0005 I DIDN'T SUPPOSE THERE WAS ANY ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW THOSE SHARP SQUEAKY VOICES THEY RATHER GET ON MY NERVES WHAT ANYBODY WANTS TO SQUEAK LIKE THAT FOR WHEN THEY CAN SING AS ROSEBREAST CAN IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
1624-142933-0006 AT THAT VERY INSTANT MISTER WREN BEGAN TO SCOLD AS ONLY HE AND JENNY CAN PETER LOOKED UP AT JENNY AND WINKED SLYLY AND WHAT ANYBODY WANTS TO SCOLD LIKE THAT FOR WHEN THEY CAN SING AS MISTER WREN CAN IS TOO MUCH FOR ME
1624-142933-0007 RETORTED PETER BUT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHO ROSEBREAST IS THE GROSBEAK OF COURSE STUPID SPUTTERED JENNY IF YOU DON'T KNOW ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK PETER RABBIT YOU CERTAINLY MUST HAVE BEEN BLIND AND DEAF EVER SINCE YOU WERE BORN
1624-142933-0008 LISTEN TO THAT JUST LISTEN TO THAT SONG PETER LISTENED THERE WERE MANY SONGS FOR IT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MORNING AND ALL THE SINGERS OF THE OLD ORCHARD WERE POURING OUT THE JOY THAT WAS WITHIN THEM
1624-142933-0009 ONE SONG WAS A LITTLE LOUDER AND CLEARER THAN THE OTHERS BECAUSE IT CAME FROM A TREE VERY CLOSE AT HAND THE VERY TREE FROM WHICH THOSE SQUEAKY NOTES HAD COME JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE PETER SUSPECTED THAT THAT MUST BE THE SONG JENNY WREN MEANT HE LOOKED PUZZLED
1624-142933-0010 HE WAS PUZZLED DO YOU MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG HE ASKED RATHER SHEEPISHLY FOR HE HAD A FEELING THAT HE WOULD BE THE VICTIM OF JENNY WREN'S SHARP TONGUE NO I DON'T MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG SNAPPED JENNY
1624-142933-0011 WHAT GOOD ARE A PAIR OF LONG EARS IF THEY CAN'T TELL ONE SONG FROM ANOTHER THAT SONG MAY SOUND SOMETHING LIKE WELCOME ROBIN'S BUT IF YOUR EARS WERE GOOD FOR ANYTHING AT ALL YOU'D KNOW RIGHT AWAY THAT THAT ISN'T WELCOME ROBIN SINGING
1624-142933-0012 THAT'S A BETTER SONG THAN WELCOME ROBIN'S WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG IS ONE OF GOOD CHEER BUT THIS ONE IS OF PURE HAPPINESS I WOULDN'T HAVE A PAIR OF EARS LIKE YOURS FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0013 PETER LAUGHED RIGHT OUT AS HE TRIED TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF JENNY WREN WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE HIS WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT DEMANDED JENNY CROSSLY DON'T YOU DARE LAUGH AT ME
1624-142933-0014 IF THERE IS ANY ONE THING I CAN'T STAND IT IS BEING LAUGHED AT I WASN'T LAUGHING AT YOU REPLIED PETER VERY MEEKLY I WAS JUST LAUGHING AT THE THOUGHT OF HOW FUNNY YOU WOULD LOOK WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE MINE
1624-142933-0015 NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT JENNY THAT SONG IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WELCOME ROBIN'S OF COURSE IT IS RETORTED JENNY THAT IS ROSEBREAST SINGING UP THERE AND THERE HE IS RIGHT IN THE TOP OF THAT TREE
1624-142933-0016 ISN'T HE HANDSOME PETER LOOKED UP TO SEE A BIRD A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS HEAD THROAT AND BACK WERE BLACK HIS WINGS WERE BLACK WITH PATCHES OF WHITE ON THEM
1624-142933-0017 BUT IT WAS HIS BREAST THAT MADE PETER CATCH HIS BREATH WITH A LITTLE GASP OF ADMIRATION FOR THAT BREAST WAS A BEAUTIFUL ROSE RED THE REST OF HIM UNDERNEATH WAS WHITE IT WAS ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK ISN'T HE LOVELY
1624-142933-0018 CRIED PETER AND ADDED IN THE NEXT BREATH WHO IS THAT WITH HIM MISSUS GROSBEAK OF COURSE WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE SPUTTERED JENNY RATHER CROSSLY FOR SHE WAS STILL A LITTLE PUT OUT BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN LAUGHED AT
1624-142933-0019 SAID PETER SHE DOESN'T LOOK THE LEAST BIT LIKE HIM THIS WAS QUITE TRUE THERE WAS NO BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR ABOUT MISSUS GROSBEAK SHE WAS DRESSED CHIEFLY IN BROWN AND GRAYISH COLORS WITH A LITTLE BUFF HERE AND THERE AND WITH DARK STREAKS ON HER BREAST
1624-142933-0020 OVER EACH EYE WAS A WHITISH LINE ALTOGETHER SHE LOOKED MORE AS IF SHE MIGHT BE A BIG MEMBER OF THE SPARROW FAMILY THAN THE WIFE OF HANDSOME ROSEBREAST
1624-142933-0021 WHILE ROSEBREAST SANG MISSUS GROSBEAK WAS VERY BUSILY PICKING BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FROM THE TREE WHAT IS SHE DOING THAT FOR INQUIRED PETER FOR THE SAME REASON THAT YOU BITE OFF SWEET CLOVER BLOSSOMS AND LEAVES
1624-142933-0022 REPLIED JENNY WREN TARTLY DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS CRIED PETER I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT YOU CAN ASK MORE SILLY QUESTIONS THAN ANYBODY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE RETORTED JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0023 OF COURSE THEY DON'T LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS IF THEY DID THEY WOULD SOON STARVE TO DEATH FOR BUDS AND BLOSSOMS DON'T LAST LONG THEY EAT A FEW JUST FOR VARIETY BUT THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON BUGS AND INSECTS
1624-142933-0024 YOU ASK FARMER BROWN'S BOY WHO HELPS HIM MOST IN HIS POTATO PATCH AND HE'LL TELL YOU IT'S THE GROSBEAKS THEY CERTAINLY DO LOVE POTATO BUGS THEY EAT SOME FRUIT BUT ON THE WHOLE THEY ARE ABOUT AS USEFUL AROUND A GARDEN AS ANY ONE I KNOW
1624-142933-0025 NOW RUN ALONG PETER RABBIT AND DON'T BOTHER ME ANY MORE SEEING FARMER BROWN'S BOY COMING THROUGH THE OLD ORCHARD PETER DECIDED THAT IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HIM TO DEPART SO HE SCAMPERED FOR THE GREEN FOREST LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP
1624-142933-0026 JUST WITHIN THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOMETHING WHICH FOR THE TIME BEING PUT ALL THOUGHT OF FARMER BROWN'S BOY OUT OF HIS HEAD FLUTTERING ON THE GROUND WAS A BIRD THAN WHOM NOT EVEN GLORY THE CARDINAL WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL
1624-142933-0027 IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF REDWING THE BLACKBIRD WINGS AND TAIL WERE PURE BLACK AND ALL THE REST WAS A BEAUTIFUL SCARLET IT WAS REDCOAT THE TANAGER AT FIRST PETER HAD EYES ONLY FOR THE WONDERFUL BEAUTY OF REDCOAT
1624-142933-0028 NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SEEN REDCOAT SO CLOSE AT HAND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER PETER THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH REDCOAT AND HE HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THE TROUBLE MIGHT BE REDCOAT HEARD THE RUSTLE OF PETER'S FEET AMONG THE DRY LEAVES
1624-142933-0029 BUT HE COULD NOT GET OFF THE GROUND WHAT IS IT REDCOAT HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU IT IS JUST PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM ME CRIED PETER THE LOOK OF TERROR WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE EYES OF REDCOAT DIED OUT
1624-142933-0030 AND HE STOPPED FLUTTERING AND SIMPLY LAY PANTING OH PETER HE GASPED YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GLAD I AM THAT IT IS ONLY YOU I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM TO DO
1624-142933-0031 I CAN'T FLY AND IF I HAVE TO STAY ON THE GROUND SOME ENEMY WILL BE SURE TO GET ME WHAT SHALL I DO PETER WHAT SHALL I DO RIGHT AWAY PETER WAS FULL OF SYMPATHY
1624-142933-0032 WHAT KIND OF AN ACCIDENT WAS IT REDCOAT AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN HE ASKED BROADWING THE HAWK TRIED TO CATCH ME
1624-142933-0033 AND DID NOT SEE JUST WHERE I WAS GOING I STRUCK A SHARP POINTED DEAD TWIG AND DROVE IT RIGHT THROUGH MY RIGHT WING REDCOAT HELD UP HIS RIGHT WING AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A LITTLE STICK PROJECTING FROM BOTH SIDES CLOSE UP TO THE SHOULDER
1624-142933-0034 THE WING WAS BLEEDING A LITTLE OH DEAR WHATEVER SHALL I DO PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0035 SOBBED REDCOAT DOES IT PAIN YOU DREADFULLY ASKED PETER REDCOAT NODDED BUT I DON'T MIND THE PAIN HE HASTENED TO SAY IT IS THE THOUGHT OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO ME
1624-142933-0036 POOR REDCOAT WITH THE OLD LOOK OF TERROR IN HIS EYES FLUTTERED ALONG TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING UNDER WHICH TO HIDE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING UNDER WHICH HE COULD CRAWL AND THERE WAS NO HIDING THAT WONDERFUL RED COAT
1624-142933-0037 PETER HEARD THE SOUND OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS AND LOOKING BACK SAW THAT FARMER BROWN'S BOY WAS COMING DON'T BE AFRAID REDCOAT HE WHISPERED IT'S FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND I'M SURE HE WON'T HURT YOU PERHAPS HE CAN HELP YOU
1624-142933-0038 THEN PETER SCAMPERED OFF FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND SAT UP TO WATCH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
1624-142933-0039 NO ONE WITH ANY EYES AT ALL COULD HAVE HELPED SEEING HIM BECAUSE OF THAT WONDERFUL SCARLET COAT HE SAW TOO BY THE WAY REDCOAT WAS ACTING THAT HE WAS IN GREAT TROUBLE AS FARMER BROWN'S BOY DREW NEAR AND REDCOAT SAW THAT HE WAS DISCOVERED
1624-142933-0040 HE TRIED HIS HARDEST TO FLUTTER AWAY FARMER BROWN'S BOY UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ONE WING AND RUNNING FORWARD HE CAUGHT REDCOAT YOU POOR LITTLE THING
1624-142933-0041 SAID FARMER BROWN'S BOY SOFTLY AS HE SAW THE CRUEL TWIG STICKING THROUGH REDCOATS SHOULDER
1624-142933-0042 CONTINUED FARMER BROWN'S BOY STROKING REDCOAT EVER SO GENTLY SOMEHOW AT THAT GENTLE TOUCH REDCOAT LOST MUCH OF HIS FEAR AND A LITTLE HOPE SPRANG IN HIS HEART
1624-142933-0043 FARMER BROWN'S BOY TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND CAREFULLY CUT OFF THE TWIG ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE WING THEN DOING HIS BEST TO BE CAREFUL AND TO HURT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE HE WORKED THE OTHER PART OF THE TWIG OUT FROM THE UNDER SIDE
1624-142933-0044 CAREFULLY HE EXAMINED THE WING TO SEE IF ANY BONES WERE BROKEN NONE WERE AND AFTER HOLDING REDCOAT A FEW MINUTES HE CAREFULLY SET HIM UP IN A TREE AND WITHDREW A SHORT DISTANCE REDCOAT HOPPED FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH
1624-142933-0045 UNTIL HE WAS HALFWAY UP THE TREE THEN HE SAT THERE FOR SOME TIME AS IF FEARFUL OF TRYING THAT INJURED WING MEANWHILE MISSUS TANAGER CAME AND FUSSED ABOUT HIM AND TALKED TO HIM AND COAXED HIM AND MADE AS MUCH OF HIM AS IF HE WERE A BABY
1624-142933-0046 FROM TREE TO TREE HE FLEW
1624-168623-0000 THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED FOR MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF THIS COUPLE AND CONSIDERING IT UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS THENARDIER HAD JUST PASSED HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY MADAME THENARDIER WAS APPROACHING HER FORTIES WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO FIFTY IN A WOMAN
1624-168623-0001 SO THAT THERE EXISTED A BALANCE OF AGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE OUR READERS HAVE POSSIBLY PRESERVED SOME RECOLLECTION OF THIS THENARDIER WOMAN EVER SINCE HER FIRST APPEARANCE TALL BLOND RED FAT ANGULAR SQUARE
1624-168623-0002 ENORMOUS AND AGILE SHE BELONGED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE RACE OF THOSE COLOSSAL WILD WOMEN WHO CONTORT THEMSELVES AT FAIRS WITH PAVING STONES HANGING FROM THEIR HAIR SHE DID EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HOUSE
1624-168623-0003 MADE THE BEDS DID THE WASHING THE COOKING AND EVERYTHING ELSE COSETTE WAS HER ONLY SERVANT A MOUSE IN THE SERVICE OF AN ELEPHANT EVERYTHING TREMBLED AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE WINDOW PANES FURNITURE AND PEOPLE
1624-168623-0004 HER BIG FACE DOTTED WITH RED BLOTCHES PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF A SKIMMER SHE HAD A BEARD SHE WAS AN IDEAL MARKET PORTER DRESSED IN WOMAN'S CLOTHES SHE SWORE SPLENDIDLY
1624-168623-0005 SHE BOASTED OF BEING ABLE TO CRACK A NUT WITH ONE BLOW OF HER FIST EXCEPT FOR THE ROMANCES WHICH SHE HAD READ AND WHICH MADE THE AFFECTED LADY PEEP THROUGH THE OGRESS AT TIMES IN A VERY QUEER WAY THE IDEA WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE TO SAY OF HER
1624-168623-0006 THAT IS A WOMAN THIS THENARDIER FEMALE WAS LIKE THE PRODUCT OF A WENCH ENGRAFTED ON A FISHWIFE WHEN ONE HEARD HER SPEAK ONE SAID THAT IS A GENDARME WHEN ONE SAW HER DRINK ONE SAID THAT IS A CARTER
1624-168623-0007 WHEN ONE SAW HER HANDLE COSETTE ONE SAID THAT IS THE HANGMAN ONE OF HER TEETH PROJECTED WHEN HER FACE WAS IN REPOSE THENARDIER WAS A SMALL THIN PALE ANGULAR BONY FEEBLE MAN
1624-168623-0008 HIS CUNNING BEGAN HERE HE SMILED HABITUALLY BY WAY OF PRECAUTION AND WAS ALMOST POLITE TO EVERYBODY EVEN TO THE BEGGAR TO WHOM HE REFUSED HALF A FARTHING HE HAD THE GLANCE OF A POLE CAT AND THE BEARING OF A MAN OF LETTERS
1624-168623-0009 HE GREATLY RESEMBLED THE PORTRAITS OF THE ABBE DELILLE HIS COQUETRY CONSISTED IN DRINKING WITH THE CARTERS NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN RENDERING HIM DRUNK HE SMOKED A BIG PIPE
1624-168623-0010 HE WORE A BLOUSE AND UNDER HIS BLOUSE AN OLD BLACK COAT HE MADE PRETENSIONS TO LITERATURE AND TO MATERIALISM THERE WERE CERTAIN NAMES WHICH HE OFTEN PRONOUNCED TO SUPPORT WHATEVER THINGS HE MIGHT BE SAYING VOLTAIRE
1624-168623-0011 HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD A SYSTEM IN ADDITION HE WAS A GREAT SWINDLER
1624-168623-0012 THE SPECIES DOES EXIST IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HE PRETENDED TO HAVE SERVED IN THE ARMY HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF RELATING WITH EXUBERANCE HOW BEING A SERGEANT IN THE SIXTH OR THE NINTH LIGHT SOMETHING OR OTHER AT WATERLOO
1624-168623-0013 HE HAD ALONE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF A SQUADRON OF DEATH DEALING HUSSARS COVERED WITH HIS BODY AND SAVED FROM DEATH IN THE MIDST OF THE GRAPE SHOT A GENERAL WHO HAD BEEN DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED
1624-168623-0014 THENCE AROSE FOR HIS WALL THE FLARING SIGN AND FOR HIS INN THE NAME WHICH IT BORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CABARET OF THE SERGEANT OF WATERLOO HE WAS A LIBERAL A CLASSIC AND A BONAPARTIST
1624-168623-0015 WE BELIEVE THAT HE HAD SIMPLY STUDIED IN HOLLAND FOR AN INN KEEPER THIS RASCAL OF COMPOSITE ORDER WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME FLEMING FROM LILLE IN FLANDERS A FRENCHMAN IN PARIS A BELGIAN AT BRUSSELS
1624-168623-0016 BEING COMFORTABLY ASTRIDE OF BOTH FRONTIERS AS FOR HIS PROWESS AT WATERLOO THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THAT IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT HE EXAGGERATED IT A TRIFLE EBB AND FLOW
1624-168623-0017 A TATTERED CONSCIENCE ENTAILS A FRAGMENTARY LIFE AND APPARENTLY AT THE STORMY EPOCH OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN THENARDIER BELONGED TO THAT VARIETY OF MARAUDING SUTLERS OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
1624-168623-0018 BEATING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SELLING TO SOME STEALING FROM OTHERS AND TRAVELLING LIKE A FAMILY MAN WITH WIFE AND CHILDREN IN A RICKETY CART IN THE REAR OF TROOPS ON THE MARCH WITH AN INSTINCT FOR ALWAYS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMY
1624-168623-0019 THIS CAMPAIGN ENDED AND HAVING AS HE SAID
1624-168623-0020 OF GOLD RINGS AND SILVER CROSSES GATHERED IN HARVEST TIME IN FURROWS SOWN WITH CORPSES DID NOT AMOUNT TO A LARGE TOTAL AND DID NOT CARRY THIS SUTLER TURNED EATING HOUSE KEEPER VERY FAR
1624-168623-0021 ACCOMPANIED BY AN OATH RECALLS THE BARRACKS AND BY A SIGN OF THE CROSS THE SEMINARY HE WAS A FINE TALKER HE ALLOWED IT TO BE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS AN EDUCATED MAN
1624-168623-0022 BUT PRACTISED EYES SOMETIMES SPIED OUT ORTHOGRAPHICAL ERRORS IN IT THENARDIER WAS CUNNING GREEDY SLOTHFUL AND CLEVER HE DID NOT DISDAIN HIS SERVANTS WHICH CAUSED HIS WIFE TO DISPENSE WITH THEM
1624-168623-0023 THIS GIANTESS WAS JEALOUS IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THAT THIN AND YELLOW LITTLE MAN MUST BE AN OBJECT COVETED BY ALL THENARDIER WHO WAS ABOVE ALL AN ASTUTE AND WELL BALANCED MAN WAS A SCAMP OF A TEMPERATE SORT
1624-168623-0024 THIS IS THE WORST SPECIES HYPOCRISY ENTERS INTO IT IT IS NOT THAT THENARDIER WAS NOT ON OCCASION CAPABLE OF WRATH TO QUITE THE SAME DEGREE AS HIS WIFE BUT THIS WAS VERY RARE
1624-168623-0025 AND AT SUCH TIMES SINCE HE WAS ENRAGED WITH THE HUMAN RACE IN GENERAL AS HE BORE WITHIN HIM A DEEP FURNACE OF HATRED AND SINCE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUALLY AVENGING THEIR WRONGS
1624-168623-0026 WHO ACCUSE EVERYTHING THAT PASSES BEFORE THEM OF EVERYTHING WHICH HAS BEFALLEN THEM AND WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO CAST UPON THE FIRST PERSON WHO COMES TO HAND AS A LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCE THE SUM TOTAL OF THE DECEPTIONS THE BANKRUPTCIES AND THE CALAMITIES OF THEIR LIVES
1624-168623-0027 WHEN ALL THIS LEAVEN WAS STIRRED UP IN HIM AND BOILED FORTH FROM HIS MOUTH AND EYES HE WAS TERRIBLE WOE TO THE PERSON WHO CAME UNDER HIS WRATH AT SUCH A TIME IN ADDITION TO HIS OTHER QUALITIES THENARDIER WAS ATTENTIVE AND PENETRATING
1624-168623-0028 SILENT OR TALKATIVE ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALWAYS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE LOOK OF SAILORS WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SCREW UP THEIR EYES TO GAZE THROUGH MARINE GLASSES THENARDIER WAS A STATESMAN
1624-168623-0029 EVERY NEW COMER WHO ENTERED THE TAVERN SAID ON CATCHING SIGHT OF MADAME THENARDIER THERE IS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE A MISTAKE SHE WAS NOT EVEN THE MISTRESS THE HUSBAND WAS BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS
1624-168623-0030 SHE WORKED HE CREATED HE DIRECTED EVERYTHING BY A SORT OF INVISIBLE AND CONSTANT MAGNETIC ACTION A WORD WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM SOMETIMES A SIGN THE MASTODON OBEYED
1624-168623-0031 THOUGH SHE DID NOT THOROUGHLY REALIZE IT SHE WAS POSSESSED OF VIRTUES AFTER HER OWN KIND IF SHE HAD EVER HAD A DISAGREEMENT AS TO ANY DETAIL WITH
1624-168623-0032 WHICH WAS AN INADMISSIBLE HYPOTHESIS BY THE WAY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BLAMED HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE COMMITTED BEFORE STRANGERS THAT
1624-168623-0033 EXPOSING THE CROWN ALTHOUGH THEIR CONCORD HAD ONLY EVIL AS ITS RESULT
1624-168623-0034 VIEWED ON ITS DWARFED AND GROTESQUE SIDE THIS WAS THAT GRAND AND UNIVERSAL THING THE ADORATION OF MIND BY MATTER FOR CERTAIN UGLY FEATURES HAVE A CAUSE IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF ETERNAL BEAUTY
1624-168623-0035 HENCE THE ABSOLUTE EMPIRE OF THE MAN OVER THAT WOMAN AT CERTAIN MOMENTS SHE BEHELD HIM LIKE A LIGHTED CANDLE AT OTHERS SHE FELT HIM LIKE A CLAW THIS WOMAN WAS A FORMIDABLE CREATURE WHO LOVED NO ONE EXCEPT HER CHILDREN
1624-168623-0036 AND WHO DID NOT FEAR ANY ONE EXCEPT HER HUSBAND SHE WAS A MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS MAMMIFEROUS BUT HER MATERNITY STOPPED SHORT WITH HER DAUGHTERS AND AS WE SHALL SEE DID NOT EXTEND TO BOYS THE MAN HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT HOW TO ENRICH HIMSELF
1624-168623-0037 A THEATRE WORTHY OF THIS GREAT TALENT WAS LACKING
1624-168623-0038 IF RUIN IS POSSIBLE TO ZERO IN SWITZERLAND OR IN THE PYRENEES THIS PENNILESS SCAMP WOULD HAVE BECOME A MILLIONAIRE BUT AN INN KEEPER MUST BROWSE WHERE FATE HAS HITCHED HIM
1624-168623-0039 IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORD INN KEEPER IS HERE EMPLOYED IN A RESTRICTED SENSE AND DOES NOT EXTEND TO AN ENTIRE CLASS IN THIS SAME YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE
1624-168623-0040 THENARDIER WAS BURDENED WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS WORTH OF PETTY DEBTS AND THIS RENDERED HIM ANXIOUS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE OBSTINATE INJUSTICE OF DESTINY IN THIS CASE THENARDIER WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO UNDERSTAND BEST
1624-168623-0041 WITH THE MOST PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES HOSPITALITY BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER
1624-168623-0042 AND QUOTED FOR HIS SKILL IN SHOOTING HE HAD A CERTAIN COLD AND TRANQUIL LAUGH WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS HIS THEORIES AS A LANDLORD SOMETIMES BURST FORTH IN LIGHTNING FLASHES
1624-168623-0043 HE HAD PROFESSIONAL APHORISMS WHICH HE INSERTED INTO HIS WIFE'S MIND THE DUTY OF THE INN KEEPER
1624-168623-0044 AND A SMILE TO STOP PASSERS BY TO EMPTY SMALL PURSES AND TO HONESTLY LIGHTEN HEAVY ONES TO SHELTER TRAVELLING FAMILIES RESPECTFULLY
1624-168623-0045 TO SHAVE THE MAN TO PLUCK THE WOMAN TO PICK THE CHILD CLEAN TO QUOTE THE WINDOW OPEN THE WINDOW SHUT THE CHIMNEY CORNER THE ARM CHAIR THE CHAIR THE OTTOMAN THE STOOL THE FEATHER BED THE MATTRESS AND THE TRUSS OF STRAW
1624-168623-0046 TO KNOW HOW MUCH THE SHADOW USES UP THE MIRROR AND TO PUT A PRICE ON IT AND BY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEVILS TO MAKE THE TRAVELLER PAY FOR EVERYTHING
1624-168623-0047 THIS MAN AND THIS WOMAN WERE RUSE AND RAGE WEDDED A HIDEOUS AND TERRIBLE TEAM WHILE THE HUSBAND PONDERED AND COMBINED MADAME THENARDIER THOUGHT NOT OF ABSENT CREDITORS
1624-168623-0048 TOOK NO HEED OF YESTERDAY NOR OF TO MORROW AND LIVED IN A FIT OF ANGER ALL IN A MINUTE SUCH WERE THESE TWO BEINGS COSETTE WAS BETWEEN THEM SUBJECTED TO THEIR DOUBLE PRESSURE
1624-168623-0049 THE MAN AND THE WOMAN EACH HAD A DIFFERENT METHOD COSETTE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH BLOWS THIS WAS THE WOMAN'S SHE WENT BAREFOOTED IN WINTER THAT WAS THE MAN'S DOING
1624-168623-0050 COSETTE RAN UP STAIRS AND DOWN WASHED SWEPT RUBBED DUSTED RAN FLUTTERED ABOUT PANTED MOVED HEAVY ARTICLES AND WEAK AS SHE WAS DID THE COARSE WORK THERE WAS NO MERCY FOR HER
1624-168623-0051 A FIERCE MISTRESS AND VENOMOUS MASTER THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB IN WHICH COSETTE HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND WHERE SHE LAY TREMBLING THE IDEAL OF OPPRESSION WAS REALIZED BY THIS SINISTER HOUSEHOLD
1624-168623-0052 IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE FLY SERVING THE SPIDERS THE POOR CHILD PASSIVELY HELD HER PEACE WHAT TAKES PLACE WITHIN THESE SOULS WHEN THEY HAVE BUT JUST QUITTED GOD FIND THEMSELVES THUS
