The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 44.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 96.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 42.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 5.2 hours of data, or 2.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 8.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (48,65.0,173)
