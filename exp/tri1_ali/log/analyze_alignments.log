The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 45.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 96.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 43.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 23.3 hours of data, or 12.8 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 9.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (45,61.7,172)
