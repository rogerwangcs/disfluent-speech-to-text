The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 40.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 96.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 39.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 23.3 hours of data, or 13.8 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 8.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (41,58.0,167)
