The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 44.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 96.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 42.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 23.3 hours of data, or 12.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 9.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (44,60.2,170)
