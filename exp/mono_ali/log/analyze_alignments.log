The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 46.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 96.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 44.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 23.3 hours of data, or 12.5 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 8.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (49,66.7,179)
